0,Aperture,Jennifer Tonge,"Open the window and you want to fly out,
though you never actually do—

I think I see you, still there on the ledge,
where I've left you.

How pulled-awake and flung
can one life be?

Again I thought, It will end.
Again I promised and clung.

I learned there that
to cling was in my nature.

I think I see you, though you flash
quickly through the shutter.

I think I hear you, though I sleep.

Remember this as a bolero,
a finite flaring—

both the tulip tree
burning in full bloom

and the weeping silver birch."
1,Apostrophe to the Apostrophe,Eric Nelson,"Small floater, you stay above the fray, 
a wink at nothing's nod, a raised brow 
watching p's and q's, a selfless mote 
between I and m, a little horn of plenty 
spilling plurals, disdaining the bottom line. 

Unlike your twin relatives—groupies of wit 
and wisdom, hangers on in the smallest talk—
you work alone, dark of a crescent moon. 
Laboring in obscurity, you never ask why, 
never exclaim, never tell anyone where to go. 

Caught up between extremes, you are both 
a turning away and a stepping forth, 
a loss and an addition. You are the urge 
to possess everything, and the sure sign 
that something is missing."
3,Appetite,Paulann Petersen,"Pale gold and crumbling with crust 
mottled dark, almost bronze, 
pieces of honeycomb lie on a plate. 
Flecked with the pale paper 
of hive, their hexagonal cells 
leak into the deepening pool 
of amber. On your lips, 
against palate, tooth and tongue, 
the viscous sugar squeezes 
from its chambers, sears sweetness 
into your throat until you chew 
pulp and wax from a blue city 
of bees. Between your teeth 
is the blown flower and the flower's 
seed. Passport pages stamped 
and turning. Death's officious hum. 
Both the candle and its anther 
of flame. Your own yellow hunger. 
Never say you can't take 
this world into your mouth."
4,Arrowhead,Robert Pack,"Where two streams joined, we met 
By accident, sitting upon an outcropping of rock 
With only the intent of watching 
Water flow beneath unwinding water. 
   Facing up-stream, she held a flower 
To the sun as I leaned back and found 
An arrowhead inside a crevice, which lay there 
As if someone had left it by intent 
As an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water 
Swirling upon stone and thus 
Transform the accident of meeting her—
Ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand—
Into stark fact as obdurate as rock. 
   Could I have called, ""Look at this arrowhead 
I just found here!"" Would she have thought 
""An accident, that's credible,""
Or feared that my intent was sinister, 
And that the implication of the arrowhead, 
Unlike the radiant white flower or 
The two streams merging into faster water, 
Casting up colored spume, 
Had been contrived by me, certain as rock 
That forms by geologic laws? 
   She had to know an arrowhead 
Is humanly designed with the intent to kill, 
Though now it's harmless as a flower 
Decorating someone's hair, 
Or water organized into a garden fountain. 
An arrowhead can now be used 
As an adornment for a necklace 
Like a flower in a painting where a stream 
Leaps past a light-reflecting rock 
With nothing in a brush-stroke left to accident. 
   And so our accidental meeting on the rock 
Flowed by, a flower cast upon the water 
With intent unknown, and all 
That's left now is the arrowhead."
5,Arrowhead Hunting,A.E. Stallings,"The land is full of what was lost. What's hidden 
Rises to the surface after rain 
In new-ploughed fields, and fields stubbled again: 
The clay shards, foot and lip, that heaped the midden, 

And here and there a blade or flakes of blade, 
A patient art, knapped from a core of flint, 
Most broken, few as coins new from the mint, 
Perfect, shot through time as through a glade. 

You cannot help but think how they were lost: 
The quarry, fletched shaft in its flank, the blood 
Whose trail soon vanished in the antlered wood, 
Not just the meat, but what the weapon cost— 

O hapless hunter, though your aim was true— 
The wounded hart, spooked, fleeting in its fear— 
And the sharpness honed with longing, year by year 
Buried deeper, found someday, but not by you."
6,At the Poetry Reading,John Brehm,"I can’t keep my eyes off the poet’s 
wife’s legs—they’re so much more 
beautiful than anything he might 
be saying, though I’m no longer 
in a position really to judge, 
having stopped listening some time ago. 
He’s from the Iowa Writers Workshop 
and can therefore get along fine 
without my attention. He started in 
reading poems about his childhood— 
barns, cornsnakes, gradeschool, flowers, 
that sort of stuff—the loss of 
innocence he keeps talking about 
between poems, which I can relate to, 
especially under these circumstances. 
Now he’s on to science, a poem 
about hydrogen, I think, he’s trying 
to imagine himself turning into hydrogen. 
Maybe he’ll succeed. I’m imagining 
myself sliding up his wife’s fluid, 
rhythmic, lusciously curved, black- 
stockinged legs, imagining them arched 
around my shoulders, wrapped around my back. 
My God, why doesn’t he write poems about her! 
He will, no doubt, once she leaves him, 
leaves him for another poet, perhaps, 
the observant, uninnocent one, who knows 
a poem when it sits down in a room with him."
7,Au Vieux Jardin,Richard Aldington,"I have sat here happy in the gardens,
Watching the still pool and the reeds
And the dark clouds
Which the wind of the upper air
Tore like the green leafy boughs
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;
But though I greatly delight
In these and the water-lilies,
That which sets me nighest to weeping
Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,
And the pale yellow grasses
Among them."
8,Bedtime Story,Charles Wright,"The generator hums like a distant ding an sich.   
It's early evening, and time, like the dog it is,   
                                                                                 is hungry for food,   
And will be fed, don't doubt it, will be fed, my small one.   
The forest begins to gather its silences in.   
The meadow regroups and hunkers down   
                                                                            for its cleft feet.   

Something is wringing the rag of sunlight   
                                                                  inexorably out and hanging.   
Something is making the reeds bend and cover their heads.   
Something is licking the shadows up,   
And stringing the blank spaces along, filling them in.   
Something is inching its way into our hearts,   
                              scratching its blue nails against the wall there.   

Should we let it in?   
                                       Should we greet it as it deserves,   
Hands on our ears, mouths open?   
Or should we bring it a chair to sit on, and offer it meat?   
Should we turn on the radio,   
                                                     should we clap our hands and dance   
The Something Dance, the welcoming Something Dance?   
                               I think we should, love, I think we should."
9,Beech,Kevin McFadden,"For a tree, you're the worst kind 
of friend, remembering everything. 
Pale-skinned, slightly brailled, blank 
page of pre-adolescence. The way 
the smallest knife-slice would darken 
with time, rise and widen. 

mark was here. Left his. 
But these are the digs you're used to, 
sufferer of mere presence, 
scratched years, scratched loves 
we wanted to write on the world 
and couldn't trust to an eardrum. 

(I scarred you myself long ago with 
my own jack-knife, jill-name. 
You took her as the morning 
unsteamed around me. Took us 
as we had to be taken, in.) Old relief, 
new reminder, I was young, what could 

I have written? Didn't care then, had          
to see it scraped out, big letters beneath 
your erotic nubs and crotches. O beech, 
it's no big riddle: we fell in the forest, 
you heard. Quiet, in your own way. 
In your own way, spreading the word."
10,Before the Rain,Lianne Spidel,"Minutes before the rain begins
I always waken, listening
to the world hold its breath,
as if a phone had rung once in a far
room or a door had creaked
in the darkness.

Perhaps the genes of some forebear
startle in me, some tribal warrior
keeping watch on a crag beside a loch,
miserable in the cold,

though I think it is a woman's waiting
I have come to know,
a Loyalist hiding in the woods,
muffling the coughing of her child
against her linen skirts, her dark head
bent over his, her fear spent
somewhere else in time,

leaving only this waiting,

and I hope she escaped
with her child, and I suppose she did.
If not, I wouldn't be lying here awake,
alive, listening for the rain to begin
so that she can run, the sound
of her footsteps lost, the sight
of them blotted away on the path."
11,The Beggars,Margaret Widdemer,"The little pitiful, worn, laughing faces, 
Begging of Life for Joy!

I saw the little daughters of the poor, 
Tense from the long day's working, strident, gay, 
Hurrying to the picture-place. There curled 
A hideous flushed beggar at the door, 
Trading upon his horror, eyeless, maimed, 
Complacent in his profitable mask. 
They mocked his horror, but they gave to him 
From the brief wealth of pay-night, and went in 
To the cheap laughter and the tawdry thoughts 
Thrown on the screen; in to the seeking hand 
Covered by darkness, to the luring voice 
Of Horror, boy-masked, whispering of rings, 
Of silks, of feathers, bought—so cheap!—with just 
Their slender starved child-bodies, palpitant 
For Beauty, Laughter, Passion, that is Life: 
(A frock of satin for an hour's shame, 
A coat of fur for two days' servitude; 
“And the clothes last,” the thought runs on, within 
The poor warped girl-minds drugged with changeless days; 
“Who cares or knows after the hour is done?”)
—Poor little beggars at Life's door for Joy! 
The old man crouched there, eyeless, horrible, 
Complacent in the marketable mask 
That earned his comforts—and they gave to him!

But ah, the little painted, wistful faces 
Questioning Life for Joy!"
12,Beginnings,Jeffrey Greene,"National Museum of Scotland

On the ground floor called ""Beginnings,"" 
a fertility stone is displayed  
in the diamond-hard blue halogen,  
a line etching of an erection  
with two equal circles, as one sees  
in graffitti in the Underground.  
The stone is attributed to the Picts,  
of whom history says little,  
besides the Latin picti,  
painted people, tattooed.  
When set side by side  
with Latin engravings  
and Roman military hardware,  
the artifact makes them  
seem pitiful. In the museum  
you rise through time,  
the text written in first  
person plural as if all  
who enter are complicitous  
with the articles of defiance,  
Robert the Bruce, the long  
unveering heredity of defeat,  
the room of thumbscrews  
and ""The Maiden"" for severing  
heretical heads of witches,  
upward to the Reformation,  
then the rout of the Highlanders  
and the exile of the Bonnie Prince,  
until the museum seems  
like a deep well where  
the fertility stone  
of the painted people  
rests at its bottom,  
universal hieroglyph  
on which someone made a wish."
13,Bel Canto,Kenneth Koch,"The sun is high, the seaside air is sharp, 
And salty light reveals the Mayan School. 
The Irish hope their names are on the harp, 
We see the sheep's advertisement for wool, 
Boulders are here, to throw against a tarp, 
From which comes bursting forth a puzzled mule. 
Perceval seizes it and mounts it, then 
The blood-dimmed tide recedes and then comes in again. 

Fateful connections that we make to things 
Whose functioning's oblivious to our lives! 
How sidewise news of light from darkness springs, 
How blue bees buzz from big blooms back to hives 
And make the honey while the queen bee sings 
Leadbelly in arrangements by Burl Ives— 
How long ago I saw the misted pine trees 
And hoped, no matter how, to get them into poetry! 

Stendhal, at fifty, gazing as it happened 
On Rome from the Janiculum, decided 
That one way he could give his life a stipend 
Was to suspend his being Amour's fighter 
And get to know himself. Here he had ripened 
Accomplished, loved, and lived, was a great writer 
But never had explored in true detail 
His childhood and his growing up. So he set sail 

Composing La Vie de Henry Brulard 
But in five hundred pages scarcely got 
Beyond his seventeenth year, for it is hard 
To take into account what happens here 
And fit it all onto an index card. 
Even one moment of it is too hot, 
Complex and cannibalistically connected 
To every other, which is what might be expected. 

Sterne's hero has a greater problem, never 
Getting much past his birth. I've had a third one. 
My autobiography, if I should ever 
Start out to write it, quickly seems a burden 
An I-will-do-that-the-next-time endeavor. 
Whatever life I do write's an absurd one 
As if some crazy person with a knife 
Cut up and made a jigsaw puzzle of a life. 

In any case a life that's hardly possible 
In the conditions that we really live in, 
Where easy flying leaps to inaccessible 
Mountainy places where love is a given 
And misery, if there, infinitesimal, 
Are quite the norm. Here none by pain is driven 
That is not curable by the romanza 
That's kept in readiness to finish any stanza. 

Whatever, then, I see at this late stage of 
My life I may or may not have stayed ignorant 
Of that great book I've strained to write one page of 
Yet always hoping my page was significant. 
Be it or not, for me and for the ages 
I leave it as it is. Yet as a figurant 
Who has not stopped, I'm writing in addition 
More lines to clarify my present disposition. 

One person in a million finds out something 
Perhaps each fifty years and that is knowledge. 
Newton, Copernicus, Einstein are cunning. 
The rest of us just rise and go to college 
With no more hope to come home with the bunting 
Than a stray dachshund going through the village. 
However, what a treat our small successes 
Of present and of past, at various addresses! 

To be in all those places where I tarried 
Too little or too late or bright and early 
To love again the first woman I married 
To marvel at such things as melancholy, 
Sophistication, drums, a baby carriage, 
A John Cage concert heard at Alice Tully— 
How my desire when young to be a poet 
Made me attentive and oblivious every moment! 

Do you remember Oceanview the Fair? 
The heights above the river? The canoes? 
The place we beached them and the grass was bare? 
Those days the sandbars gave our knees a truce? 
The crooked line of pantry shelves, with pear 
And cherry jam? And Pancho, with his noose? 
Do you remember Full and Half and Empty? 
Do you remember sorrow standing in the entry? 

Do you remember thought, and talking plainly? 
Michel and I went walking after Chartres 
Cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly 
By giving us an insight into Barthes. 
Michel said he was capable of feigning 
Renewed intentions of the soul's deep part, 
Like this cathedral's artificial forces 
That press a kind of artless thought into our faces. 

And yet—   The moor is dark beneath the moon. 
The porcupine turns over on its belly 
And new conceptions rap at the cocoon. 
Civilization, dealing with us fairly, 
For once, releases its Erectheion 
Of understanding, which consoles us, nearly. 
Later we study certain characteristics 
That may give us a better chance with the statistics. 

How much I'd like to live the whole thing over, 
But making some corrections as I go! 
To be a better husband and a father, 
Be with my babies on a sled in snow. 
By twenty I'd have understood my mother 
And by compassion found a way to know 
What separates the what-I-started-out-as 
From what-I-sometimes-wished-I-was-when-in-the-mountains. 

To be once more the one who what was worthy 
Of courtship courted—it was quite as stressful 
As trying to, er, as they say, give birth to 
A poem and as often unsuccessful, 
But it was nice to be sublime and flirty 
With radiant girls, and, in some strange way, restful. 
I could be everything I wasn't usually— 
And then to get somebody else to feel it mutually! 

In poems the same problem or a similar. 
Desire of course not only to do old things 
But things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors 
And of the melancholy finch be co-finch 
In singing songs with such a broad parameter 
That seamstresses would stare, forget to sew things, 
Astronauts quit the sky, athletes the stadium 
To hear them, and the rest of what they hear be tedium. 

Such wild desires, I think it's recognizable 
Are part and parcel of the Human Image 
And in a way, I'd say, no less predictable 
Than Popeye's feelings for a can of spinach. 
Yet if we're set on course by the Invisible, 
All pre-determined, what about the language 
That teases me each morning with its leanings 
Toward the Unprogrammed Altitudes beyond its meanings? 

Are you, O particles, O atoms, nominatives 
Like Percevals and Stendhals, set in motion 
By some Ordaining Will that is definitive? 
Is this invading chill and high emotion, 
This tendency to know one is regenerative, 
Is this, all, tidal take-home like the ocean? 
Be what you may, my thanks for your society 
Through the long life I've had, your jokes and your variety, 

The warmth you've shown in giving me a temperature 
That I can live with, and the strength you've shared with me 
In arms and legs—and for your part in literature, 
What can I say? It is as if life stared at me 
And kissed my lips and left it as a signature. 
Thank you for that, and thank you for preparing me 
For love itself, and friendship, its co-agent. 
Thank you for being this, and for its inspiration."
14,Bernal Hill,Randall Mann,"Something has to give. 
We stand above it all. 
Below, the buildings' tall 
but tiny narrative. 

The water's always near, 
you say. And so are you, 
for now. It has to do. 
There's little left to fear. 

A wind so cold, one might 
forget that winter's gone. 
The city lights are on 
for us, to us, tonight."
15,BETTER DAYS,A. F. Moritz,"Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe  
does the summer when I was seventeen come back  
to mind against my will, like a bird crossing  

my vision. Summer of moist nights full of girls  
and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation  
of the comic boundaries, defiances that never  

failed or brought disaster. Days on the backs  
and in the breath of horses, between rivers  
and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,  

enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves  
over muscular water. All those things accepted,  
once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant  

accepts the nipple, never come back to mind  
against the will. What comes unsummoned now,  
blotting out every other thought and image,  

is a part of the past not so deep or far away:  
the time of poverty, of struggle to find means  
not hateful—the muddy seedtime of early manhood.  

What returns are those moments in the diner  
night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,  
watching an old man, who always at the same hour  

came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened  
his drawing pad. What did he fill it with?  
And where's he gone? Those days, that studious worker,  

hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,  
that artist always in the same worn-out suit,  
are my nostalgia now. That old man comes back,  

the friend I saw each day and never spoke to,  
because I hoped soon to disappear from there,  
as I have disappeared, into the heaven of better days."
16,Between Hallowe'en and Bonfire Night,Roddy Lumsden,"Just then, encountering my ruddy face    
in the grand piano's cold black craquelure,    
it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon    
dipping up over the roofs of the Tenderloin.    
    
Only when I have done with the myths—    
the inner spill that triggers us to flame,    
breasts so sensitive a moment's touch             
will call down fever; the dark sea-lane    
    
between limbic squall and the heart's harbour—    
will I picture you, just beyond innocence,    
lying stripped by a thrown-wide window,    
letting the cool breeze covet your ardour."
17,Beyond the Stars,Charles Hanson Towne,"Three days I heard them grieve when I lay dead, 
(It was so strange to me that they should weep!) 
Tall candles burned about me in the dark, 
And a great crucifix was on my breast, 
And a great silence filled the lonesome room. 

I heard one whisper, ""Lo! the dawn is breaking, 
And he has lost the wonder of the day."" 
Another came whom I had loved on earth, 
And kissed my brow and brushed my dampened hair. 
Softly she spoke: ""Oh that he should not see 
The April that his spirit bathed in! Birds 
Are singing in the orchard, and the grass 
That soon will cover him is growing green. 
The daisies whiten on the emerald hills, 
And the immortal magic that he loved 
Wakens again—and he has fallen asleep."" 
Another said: ""Last night I saw the moon 
Like a tremendous lantern shine in heaven, 
And I could only think of him-and sob. 
For I remembered evenings wonderful 
When he was faint with Life's sad loveliness, 
And watched the silver ribbons wandering far 
Along the shore, and out upon the sea. 
Oh, I remembered how he loved the world, 
The sighing ocean and the flaming stars, 

The everlasting glamour God has given— 
-His tapestries that wrap the earth's wide room. 
I minded me of mornings filled with rain 
When he would sit and listen to the sound 
As if it were lost music from the spheres. 
He loved the crocus and the hawthorn-hedge, 
He loved the shining gold of buttercups, 
And the low droning of the drowsy bees 
That boomed across the meadows. He was glad 
At dawn or sundown; glad when Autumn came 
With her worn livery and scarlet crown, 
And glad when Winter rocked the earth to rest. 
Strange that he sleeps today when Life is young, 
And the wild banners of the Spring are blowing 
With green inscriptions of the old delight."" 

I heard them whisper in the quiet room. 
I longed to open then my sealèd eyes, 
And tell them of the glory that was mine. 
There was no darkness where my spirit flew, 
There was no night beyond the teeming world. 
Their April was like winter where I roamed; 
Their flowers were like stones where now I fared. 
Earth's day! it was as if I had not known 
What sunlight meant! . . Yea, even as they grieved 
For all that I had lost in their pale place, 
I swung beyond the borders of the sky, 
And floated through the clouds, myself the air, 

Myself the ether, yet a matchless being 
Whom God had snatched from penury and pain 
To draw across the barricades of heaven. 
I clomb beyond the sun, beyond the moon; 
In flight on flight I touched the highest star; 
I plunged to regions where the Spring is born, 
Myself (I asked not how) the April wind, 
Myself the elements that are of God. 
Up flowery stairways of eternity 
I whirled in wonder and untrammeled joy, 
An atom, yet a portion of His dream— 
His dream that knows no end. . . . 
                                                         I was the rain, 
I was the dawn, I was the purple east, 
I was the moonlight on enchanted nights, 
(Yet time was lost to me); I was a flower 
For one to pluck who loved me; I was bliss, 
And rapture, splendid moments of delight; 
And I was prayer, and solitude, and hope; 
And always, always, always I was love. 
I tore asunder flimsy doors of time, 
And through the windows of my soul's new sight 
I saw beyond the ultimate bounds of space. 
I was all things that I had loved on earth— 
The very moonbeam in that quiet room, 
The very sunlight one had dreamed I lost, 
The soul of the returning April grass, 
The spirit of the evening and the dawn, 
The perfume in unnumbered hawthorn-blooms. 
There was no shadow on my perfect peace, 
No knowledge that was hidden from my heart. 
I learned what music meant; I read the years; 
I found where rainbows hide, where tears begin; 
I trod the precincts of things yet unborn. 

Yea, while I found all wisdom (being dead), 
They grieved for me. . I should have grieved for them!"
18,Body,Alissa Valles,"Map of terror and pleasure,
ardent junk, passionate congress
filled with the arguments of chemicals,

Echo chamber for the fanatical cries
of stubborn generations, all the quaint invisibles
death has grown a beard on,

labyrinth of desire, playing field of impulse,
factory where decay's silent armies clock in,
philosopher-clown blowing a horn at each epiphany.

Washed by the rough nurse of morning,
wheeled into the ward of the afternoon,
feeds, grateful, on the rich broth of dusk.

Reads the erratic cards of dreams,
turns on the rack of insomnia,
steals the two-bit grace of sleep.

Loses its name in foreign embraces,
forges a passport to the country of tenderness,
gestures like a child at the thing that it wants,
opaque from its own breath on the glass."
19,Body and Soul,Sharon Bryan,"They grow up together 
but they aren't even fraternal 

twins, they quarrel a lot 
about where to go and what 

to do, the body complains 
about having to carry 

the soul everywhere as if 
it were some helpless cripple, 

and the soul snipes that it can go 
places the body never dreamed of, 

then they quarrel over which one of them 
does the dreaming, but the truth is, 

they can't live without each other and 
they both know it, anima, animosity, 

the diaphragm pumps like a bellows 
and the soul pulls out all the stops— 

sings at the top of its lungs, laughs 
at its little jokes, it would like 

to think it has the upper hand 
and can leave whenever it wants— 

but only as long as it knows 
the door will be unlocked 

when it sneaks back home before 
the sun comes up, and when the body 

says where have you been, the soul 
says, with a smirk, I was at the end 

of my tether, and it was, like a diver 
on the ocean floor or an astronaut 

admiring the view from outside 
the mother ship, and like them 

it would be lost without its air 
supply and protective clothing, 

the body knows that and begins 
to hum, I get along without you 

very well, and  the soul says, Listen 
to that, you can't sing worth a lick 

without me, they'll go on bickering 
like this until death do them part— 

and then, even if the soul seems to float 
above the body for a moment, 

like a flame above a candle, pinch 
the wick and it disappears."
20,A Book on a Shelf,Roger Mitchell,"A history of some sort, one that made us, 
a war and what the war had meant, or since 
meaning eludes war, what it did to the look 
of the trees and the sides of the buildings, 
most of which survived, only to be torn down 
later to widen the street or put up a new 
office complex. There it was on the shelf. 
I was there only a moment, but still, 
I wanted to know what happened to the man 
in the photograph wearing a flat cap 
standing outside the important building 
cheering. He was there. He was part of that 
moment, one of the first into the streets 
when the turn of events came, the declaration 
or pronouncement, words that would change 
the look of everything he smiled on, words 
that may have cost him his life. Here it is 
in a book I found on a shelf. The person 
who lives here bought it at a library 
stock reduction sale. No one had read it. 
It looked interesting thirty years ago. 
It was practically new, the back uncracked. 
But the person did what those before her had, 
put it up on a shelf and never found 
a way back to it. The history sits there, 
unread, unbelievable, somebody else's. 
Even I have only looked at the pictures, 
at the man smiling between the cold pages. 
Maybe ending the world as he knew it 
was ok. Maybe it was the only way. 
Maybe the world has to come to an end 
in the first place to be the world. And the man? 
He has to smile, though he knows so little 
of what's coming, even looking right at it. 
As we do, who still haven't read the book."
21,Breakage,Mary Oliver,"I go down to the edge of the sea. 
How everything shines in the morning light! 
The cusp of the whelk, 
the broken cupboard of the clam, 
the opened, blue mussels, 
moon snails, pale pink and barnacle scarred— 
and nothing at all whole or shut, but tattered, split, 
dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone. 
It's like a schoolhouse 
of little words, 
thousands of words. 
First you figure out what each one means by itself, 
the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop 
       full of moonlight. 

Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story."
22,Cabezón,Amy Beeder,"I see you shuffle up Washington Street
whenever I am driving much too fast:
you, chub & bug-eyed, jaw like a loaf
hands in your pockets, a smoke dangling slack
from the slit of your pumpkin mouth,
humped over like the eel-man or geek,
the dummy paid to sweep out gutters,

drown the cats. Where are you going now?
Though someday you'll turn your gaze
upon my shadow in this tinted glass
I know for now you only look ahead
at sidewalks cracked & paved with trash
but what are you slouching toward—knee-locked,
hippity, a hitch in your zombie walk, Bighead?"
23,Call It Music,Philip Levine,"Some days I catch a rhythm, almost a song  
in my own breath. I'm alone here  
in Brooklyn Heights, late morning, the sky  
above the St. George Hotel clear, clear  
for New York, that is. The radio playing  
""Bird Flight,"" Parker in his California  
tragic voice fifty years ago, his faltering  
""Lover Man"" just before he crashed into chaos.  
I would guess that outside the recording studio  
in Burbank the sun was high above the jacarandas,  
it was late March, the worst of yesterday's rain  
had come and gone, the sky washed blue. Bird  
could have seen for miles if he'd looked, but what  
he saw was so foreign he clenched his eyes,  
shook his head, and barked like a dog—just once—  
and then Howard McGhee took his arm and assured him  
he'd be OK. I know this because Howard told me  
years later that he thought Bird could  
lie down in the hotel room they shared, sleep  
for an hour or more, and waken as himself.  
The perfect sunlight angles into my little room  
above Willow Street. I listen to my breath  
come and go and try to catch its curious taste,  
part milk, part iron, part blood, as it passes  
from me into the world. This is not me,  
this is automatic, this entering and exiting,  
my body's essential occupation without which  
I am a thing. The whole process has a name,  
a word I don't know, an elegant word not  
in English or Yiddish or Spanish, a word  
that means nothing to me. Howard truly believed  
what he said that day when he steered  
Parker into a cab and drove the silent miles  
beside him while the bright world  
unfurled around them: filling stations, stands  
of fruits and vegetables, a kiosk selling trinkets  
from Mexico and the Philippines. It was all  
so actual and Western, it was a new creation  
coming into being, like the music of Charlie Parker  
someone later called ""glad,"" though that day  
I would have said silent, ""the silent music  
of Charlie Parker."" Howard said nothing.  
He paid the driver and helped Bird up two flights  
to their room, got his boots off, and went out  
to let him sleep as the afternoon entered  
the history of darkness. I'm not judging  
Howard, he did better than I could have  
now or then. Then I was 19, working  
on the loading docks at Railway Express,  
coming day by day into the damaged body  
of a man while I sang into the filthy air  
the Yiddish drinking songs my Zadie taught me  
before his breath failed. Now Howard is gone,  
eleven long years gone, the sweet voice silenced.  
""The subtle bridge between Eldridge and Navarro,""  
they later wrote, all that rising passion  
a footnote to others. I remember in '85  
walking the halls of Cass Tech, the high school  
where he taught after his performing days,  
when suddenly he took my left hand in his  
two hands to tell me it all worked out  
for the best. Maybe he'd gotten religion,  
maybe he knew how little time was left,  
maybe that day he was just worn down  
by my questions about Parker. To him Bird  
was truly Charlie Parker, a man, a silent note  
going out forever on the breath of genius  
which now I hear soaring above my own breath  
as this bright morning fades into afternoon.  
Music, I'll call it music. It's what we need  
as the sun staggers behind the low gray clouds  
blowing relentlessly in from that nameless ocean,  
the calm and endless one I've still to cross."
24,Candles,Carl Dennis,"If on your grandmother's birthday you burn a candle   
To honor her memory, you might think of burning an extra   
To honor the memory of someone who never met her,   
A man who may have come to the town she lived in   
Looking for work and never found it.   
Picture him taking a stroll one morning,   
After a month of grief with the want ads,   
To refresh himself in the park before moving on.   
Suppose he notices on the gravel path the shards   
Of a green glass bottle that your grandmother,   
Then still a girl, will be destined to step on   
When she wanders barefoot away from her school picnic   
If he doesn't stoop down and scoop the mess up   
With the want-ad section and carry it to a trash can.   

For you to burn a candle for him   
You needn't suppose the cut would be a deep one,   
Just deep enough to keep her at home   
The night of the hay ride when she meets Helen,   
Who is soon to become her dearest friend,   
Whose brother George, thirty years later,   
Helps your grandfather with a loan so his shoe store   
Doesn't go under in the Great Depression   
And his son, your father, is able to stay in school   
Where his love of learning is fanned into flames,   
A love he labors, later, to kindle in you.   

How grateful you are for your father's efforts   
Is shown by the candles you've burned for him.   
But today, for a change, why not a candle   
For the man whose name is unknown to you?   
Take a moment to wonder whether he died at home   
With friends and family or alone on the road,   
On the look-out for no one to sit at his bedside   
And hold his hand, the very hand   
It's time for you to imagine holding."
26,Careless Perfection,Daniel Halpern,"According to Lin Yutang,
both Po Chuyi and Su Tungpo
""desperately admired"" Tao Yuanming,

a poet of nature who wrote a single love poem,
a poem thought by Chinese dilettantes to be
the one ""blemish in a white jade.""

Can a poet be faulted for calling a woman
 carelessly perfect in beauty?
He chose to long for her by envying

the candle that glowed upon her
beautiful face, the shadow
that followed in her every move.

Yet the nature poet Tao Yuanming, at home
with the sudden turning of seasons,
now feared the shadow in darkness,

a discarded fan that once stirred her hair,
feared the candle at dawn. At last believed
that for beauty he had lived in vain."
27,Casanova's Bossa Nova,Rich Murphy,"The dance shoes, seduction 
and coercion, owned by male feet, 
roam floors that beg for chandeliers. 
In search of flat-footed beauty 

and a bed, where ever they might be, 
the handsome conversation attracts 
female followers trading on the smiles 
of curves. The next steps are dizzying 

and leave dresses dipped and hung over 
with a purse and heart opened at 
their tops. The wallflowers can't say 
when the tango with the rag doll began, 

but witnesses toasted a conga line 
of would-be brides that transcend 
a retirement community in Florida, 
each giving up their precious moments 

on Earth to fandango's flimflam."
28,A CAVE OF ANGELFISH HUDDLE AGAINST THE MOON,Ron De Maris,"Put an ear to the light at fall
of dark and you will hear
nothing. This pale luminescence
that drifts in upon them
makes a blue bole of their caves,
a scare of their scything
tails. They tell
in the bubbling dark of images
that come in upon them
when light spreads like an oil slick
and sea fans
that once were their refuge
turn away.
Now there is no dark
dark enough for their silver tails,
scatter of color
(like coins massively
piling in the lap of a miser)
that was, in the day, their pride.
 How hugely here we belong.
This is their song
in the silting
drift of the reef.
They have never seen the moon
nor the black scut of night, stars
spread like plankton
in their beastly infinities."
29,Chamber Thicket,Sharon Olds,"As we sat at the feet of the string quartet,  
in their living room, on a winter night,  
through the hardwood floor spurts and gulps  
and tips and shudders came up, and the candle-scent  
air was thick-alive with pearwood,  
ebony, spruce, poplar, and horse  
howled, and cat skreeled, and then,  
when the Grösse Fugue was around us, under us,  
over us, in us, I felt I was hearing  
the genes of my birth-family, pulled, keening  
and grieving and scathing, along each other,  
scraping and craving, I felt myself held in that  
woods of hating longing, and I knew  
and knew myself, and my parents, and their parents,  
there—and then, at a distance, I sensed,  
as if it were thirty years ago,  
a being, far off yet, oblique-approaching,  
straying toward, and then not toward,  
and then toward this place, like a wandering dreaming  
herdsman, my husband. And I almost wanted  
to warn him away, to call out to him  
to go back whence he came, into some calmer life,  
but his beauty was too moving to me,  
and I wanted too much to not be alone, in the  
covert, any more, and so I prayed him  
come to me, I bid him hasten, and good welcome."
30,Chicken Pig,Jennifer Michael Hecht,"It’s like being lost 
in the forest, hungry, with a 
plump live chicken in your cradling 
arms: you want to savage the bird, 
but you also want the eggs. 

You go weak on your legs. 
What’s worse, what you need 
most is the companionship, 
but you’re too hungry to know that. 
That is something you only know after 
you’ve been lost a lot and always, 

eventually, alit upon 
your bird; consumed her 
before you’d realized what 
a friend she’d been, letting you 
sleep-in late on the forest floor 
though she herself awoke 
at the moment of dawn 

and thought of long-lost 
rooster voices quaking 
the golden straw. She 
looks over at you, sleeping, 
and what can I tell you, she loves 
you, but like a friend. 

Eventually, when lost 
in a forest with a friendly chicken 
you make a point of emerging 
from the woods together, 
triumphant; her, fat with bugs, 
you, lean with berries. 

Still, while you yet wander, 
you can not resist telling her 
your joke: 

Guy sees a pig with three legs, 
asks the farmer, What gives? 
Farmer says, That pig woke 
my family from a fire, got us all out. 
Says the guy, And lost the leg thereby? 
Nope, says the farmer, 
Still had all four when he took  
a bullet for me when I had  
my little struggle with the law. 
Guy nods, So that’s where  
he lost his paw? Farmer shakes 
it off, says, Nah, we fixed him up. 
A pause, guy says, So how’d he lose  
the leg? Farmer says, Well, hell, 
a pig like that  
you don’t eat all at once. 

Chicken squints. Doesn’t think 
it’s funny."
31,Chord,Stuart Dybek,"A man steps out of sunlight,
sunlight that streams like grace,

still gaping at blue sky
staked across the emptiness of space,

into a history where shadows
assume a human face.

A man slips into silence
that began as a cry,

still trailing music
although reduced to the sigh

of an accordion
as it folds into its case."
32,Christmas Tree Lots,Chris Green,"Christmas trees lined like war refugees, 
a fallen army made to stand in their greens. 
Cut down at the foot, on their last leg, 

they pull themselves up, arms raised. 
We drop them like wood; 
tied, they are driven through the streets, 

dragged through the door, cornered 
in a room, given a single blanket, 
only water to drink, surrounded by joy. 

Forced to wear a gaudy gold star, 
to surrender their pride, 
they do their best to look alive."
33,Cleaning an Attic,Brent Pallas,"The day had finally come  
when everything there  

seemed misplaced or out of place  
as an ex's box of things. The unused  

beside the irreplaceable, the easy-  
to-assemble uncomplicated now  

by disuse. Some hand  
of randomness leaving behind  

its lampshades stained  
like ancient maps, its ladders  

still climbing upward, and enough  
old tools to restart a world.  

Every drawer filled  
with the other half of things.  

Everything care embraced,  
and held once as new,  

left too ragged for another winter  
to wear. Its ring of keys  

dangling by a nail  
for rooms left long ago. And whatever  

I said I'd never forget  
found, just as it seemed  

completely forgot—all its letters  
beginning with Dear...."
34,Color in American History: An Essay,Tom Disch,"Did they enjoy this, those honorary ancestors 
Of ours, whom we may not speak of as Indians now, 
But, rather, as Native Americans? Did they, that is, 
Have the opportunity to take in such views? 
For there were no roads then, slicing through 
The hills, opening vistas like this. Astonishing! 
Unless, perhaps, they were upon the Delaware, 
A kind of road itself. But, otherwise, would not 
The land itself have been an inconvenience, 
The changing leaves an oracle of cruelties 
To come and not, as for the tourists on a bus, 
A postcard to sweep up at a glance and then 
Go home to the similar view they own— 
One stately maple, or two, intensely orange? 
Only the birds, may be, might have known 
These colors, the sudden shift of gears from green 
To ocher, umber, brightest yellow, deepest red, 
The colors of the gleeful dead. For birds can fly 
Above the trees and see what we see from a bus. 
But is there gladness in their flight? Might it 
Not as well be night? And Indians (forgive the word), 
Did they delight more than a bird? Were there 
Esthetes then as now, before the ax, 
The ox, the plow? I must believe there were— 
And why? Because they traded all Manhattan 
For a handful of ceramic beads. They knew, 
As we, that a glint of pure bright blue 
Is worth a whole October day, or two."
35,Conches on Christmas,Mike Chasar,"Diluvian, draggled and derelict posse, this 
barnacled pod so pales 
next to everything we hear of red tides and pilot whales 
that a word like “drama” makes me sound remiss 

except that there 
was a kind of littoral drama in the way the shells 
silently, sans the heraldry of bells, 
neatly, sans an astrological affair, 

and swiftly, sans a multitude of feet, flat-out arrived— 
an encrusted school of twenty-four 
Gabriellan trumpets at my beach house door 
and barely half-alive. 

Oh, you can bet 
I picked them up, waded right up to my ankles in 
there among ’em, hefted ’em up to my ears to hear the din 
of all things oceanwise and wet, 

but every of the ancient, bearded, anthracite, 
salt-water-logged spirals, 
every of the massive and unwieldy, magisterial 
mollusks shut tight— 

no din, no horns roaring reveille, no warning, no beat, no taps, 
no coral corpus, 
no porpoise purpose 
except it was a secret purpose kept strictly under wraps. 

A fine Christmas gift indeed, this 
obscure migration, 
this half-dead conch confederation 
which would have smelled yon tannenbaum like fish— 

a fine set of unwrappable presents 
and no receipt by which I could redeem them. 
I lifted one up by its stem 
and thought of how, by increments, 

all twenty-four 
must have lugged those preassembled bodies here 
sans Santa, sleigh, and eight little reindeer, 
to my drasty stretch of shore. 

And, no other explanation being offered for the situation, 
I thought that I might understand 
how one could argue that the impulse driving them to land 
was a sort of evolutionary one— 

misguided, yes, redundant, a million years too late, 
a needless, maybe rogue and almost campy 
demonstration of how history, 
even in the world of the invertebrate, 

repeats itself—breaker 
crashing down on breaker in the Gulf, Gulf War 
coming after Gulf War. 
O Maker, 

there is so much slug inside these shells, 
here, at the end of December, 
at the edge of a world I couldn’t blame if you did not remember. 
Miracles sell well, 

but Lord, it can be numbing 
to a people who cannot 
tell between a second nature and a second thought, 
a second chance, or a second coming."
36,Confession,Reginald Gibbons,"Down in the blue-green water  
       at nightfall some selving shapes  
float fluorescing, trance-dancing,  
       trembling to the rhythm of  
theodoxical marching-  
       music that they hear over  
the mere noise of the breaking  
       tide. Above, stars in certain  
places; along the shore roads,  
       cars carrying people on  
uncertain errands, sordid  
       and sacred and all the kinds  
in between. Halogen-lit,  
       a woman gets down from her  
all-wheel-drive velocipede,  
       enters through an obeying  
door a cyclopean store  
       to buy unintelligent  
fresh fish and other objects  
       whether formerly alive  
or formerly dead, she comes  
       out again, a poor man calls  
to her, selling his no-news-  
       paper; the disastrous head-  
lines smile and nod, they announce  
       the plans of steel patriots  
and undertakers, ad-men  
       and fallen vice-generals,  
doping their stolen crusades.  
       But the woman has learned, as  
I have learned, as all of us  
       must keep learning if we are  
to be good subjects, how to  
       make of a newspaper the  
mask of a locust, calmly  
       put it on, and begin once  
more to eat everything up."
37,Count Down,Robin Morgan,"Survival is the final offer
that arrives at the eleventh hour
just when pain to the tenth power
would kill you with another ninth degree.

By then, relief strikes you brief as an eighth note;
you wear doom proudly; it's your seventh seal.
But life whispers through your sixth sense
of what might await you in some fifth dimension

where miracle is saved for the fourth quarter.
Tricked, you sigh and rise on the third day.
You know better, but with no second thought,
risk that first step—absurd as first love at first sight—

as if you were back at ground zero, as if it cost
nothing, as if this were not the last laugh."
38,Country Love Song,Melanie Almeder,"I try to think of the cup of a hand,  
of legs in a tangle, and not the thistle  

though even it, purpled, spiking away,  
wants to be admired, wants to say, whistle  

a little for me. O every little thing wants 
to be loved, wants to be marked by the cry  

that brings desire to it, even blue-eyed fly  
to the bloated hiss of death. To love is to be remiss:  

the horse alone in the wide flat field nods 
its head as if the bridle and bit were missed  

or mocked; the cow slung with the unmilked weight  
of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder  

at O lonesome me. I want to say to her need            
as if crooning could be enough,  

sweet, sweet mama . . . truth be told,  
the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds' honey  

terrifies me. When the stink of slurry season  
is over and the greened fields are slathered, fecund,  

overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit.  
Then I dream a little dream of you  

and me, curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf  
wind-driven and scudding along the lake's surface.  

All night we glide to its blue harbor  
and back again. The fattened slack of us  

singing O darlin' darlin'  darlin'."
39,Cozy Apologia,Rita Dove,"For Fred

I could pick anything and think of you—  
This lamp, the wind-still rain, the glossy blue  
My pen exudes, drying matte, upon the page.  
I could choose any hero, any cause or age  
And, sure as shooting arrows to the heart,  
Astride a dappled mare, legs braced as far apart  
As standing in silver stirrups will allow—  
There you'll be, with furrowed brow  
And chain mail glinting, to set me free:  
One eye smiling, the other firm upon the enemy.  

This post-postmodern age is all business: compact disks  
And faxes, a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks  
Event. Today a hurricane is nudging up the coast,  
Oddly male: Big Bad Floyd, who brings a host  
Of daydreams: awkward reminiscences  
Of teenage crushes on worthless boys  
Whose only talent was to kiss you senseless.  
They all had sissy names—Marcel, Percy, Dewey;  
Were thin as licorice and as chewy,  
Sweet with a dark and hollow center. Floyd's  

Cussing up a storm. You're bunkered in your  
Aerie, I'm perched in mine  
(Twin desks, computers, hardwood floors):  
We're content, but fall short of the Divine.  
Still, it's embarrassing, this happiness—  
Who's satisfied simply with what's good for us,  
When has the ordinary ever been news?  
And yet, because nothing else will do  
To keep me from melancholy (call it blues),  
I fill this stolen time with you."
40,Crossing the Days,James Scruton,"My son's been learning time: big hand 
and little, powers of sixty 
and of twenty-four, the slow semaphore 
of days. He's brought home paper plates 
from kindergarten, arrows pointing 
at his favorite hours. So far 
the face of every clock has smiled. 

And before we read to sleep each night 
he crosses off another square 
on the calendar above his bed, 
counting down to Christmas or to nothing 
in particular, sometimes just a line 
he draws uphill or down, check marks 
like the ones his teacher leaves 

on sheets he's filled with capitals 
and lower cases, other times a pair 
of thick lines like the crossed bones 
on a pirate's flag, an X 
as if to mark the treasure buried 
in some ordinary week, 
no day yet a cross to bear."
41,The Crow,Kunst Judith McCune,"Was it because
at last
I cleaned the window

that he threw himself
against the glass?
I thought, poor crow—

he doesn't know
the evergreens
and blue sky

are behind him.
I turned back
to my page

but whumpp—
the bird attacked
the glass again.

His long claws
scuffled at the pane
and I yelled ""Crow!

Go away!""
Again his body slapped
the glass,

again
and then again,
and then at last

he caught my eye—
oh, prophet,
terrified."
42,The Dead,Don Paterson,"Our business is with fruit and leaf and bloom;    
though they speak with more than just the season's tongue—    
the colours that they blaze from the dark loam    
all have something of the jealous tang    
    
of the dead about them. What do we know of their part    
in this, those secret brothers of the harrow,    
invigorators of the soil—oiling the dirt    
so liberally with their essence, their black marrow?    
    
But here's the question. Are the flower and fruit    
held out to us in love, or merely thrust    
up at us, their masters, like a fist?    
    
Or are they the lords, asleep amongst the roots,    
granting to us in their great largesse    
this hybrid thing—part brute force, part mute kiss?"
43,Deaf Night at O'Donnell's,Art Nahill,"I happen in 
from another unremarkable 
Tuesday in the realm 
of gratuitous sound, but here, 
I can hear again 
the quiet voices of the ontological, 
the clink of ice cubes 
in uplifted glasses, 
the scrape of chairs, 
the mournful lowing of floorboards, 
the long history of blood 
retold in my ears. 

I scuffle to the bar, thoughts 
drowned 
by my suddenly thunderous 
presence in this world, 
and the silence flowing 
from the neon jukebox, 
the silence going down 
smooth as the shot 
of loneliness that would 
naturally follow 
a Billie Holiday song 
if one were playing— 

—while everywhere hands 
are fluttering like sheets 
in winds of gossip, 
hollering above last call 
for one more round."
44,Dear Mr. Merrill,Moira Egan,"I hope you'll pardon the informality   
of this letter, postmarked Olympia   
(Greece, not Washington), its task not simple:   
crossing lines you've crossed, time, mortality,   
to find you, who spent a lifetime crossing lines   
out, twisting, polishing them to shine   

cool and lustrous as the statue I fell in   
love with yesterday. I'm sure you saw him   
too, that perfect Hermes by Praxitelis,   
full lips, hips contrapposto. I wished to draw him   
down, latter-day Pygmalion, and embrace   
him. Or barring Eros (and the guards) I'd trace   

his face, the supple muscle of the marble.   
I had a student who resembled him—   
yes, Angelos—arrogant and beautiful.   
I never touched him though he touches me in dreams.   
Eros dangles his perfection in our faces   
like one-armed Hermes with his promise of the grapes.   

I was certain I'd dream of him last night.   
Instead I dreamed another in the growing chain   
of others with whom it ended not quite   
right. But the thirst was perfect, if its price pain   
and shattered crystal, spilling wine, all part   
and parcel of our imperfect lives. Then Art   

startles out of heartache, marble or page.   
You learned this long ago. Now I too see   
the wildest things require the strongest cages,   
the panther's double bars, or the seeds,   
bloodysweet and bitter, in the pomegranate's   
rind. Love held tight in a sonnet."
45,Descent,Samuel Menashe,"My father drummed darkness  
Through the underbrush  
Until lightning struck  

I take after him  

Clouds crowd the sky  
Around me as I run  
Downhill on a high—  
I am my mother's son  
Born long ago  
In the storm's eye"
46,The Dignity of Ushers,Al Maginnes,"Their authority did not unfold 
from ironed white shirts and thin ties 
or from the funereal seriousness that struck 
their acne-splashed faces but because 
they stood heir to our native faith in light. 

So we followed the thin white waver 
of beams they pointed down aisles 
to seats we never thought of refusing. 
It was the first job I wanted, 
especially after birthday outings 

far from home showed me the glowing 
outfits worn by big-city ushers, their get-ups 
a blend of doorman and military dictator, 
as gaudy and fine as the plots 
of movies my Saturdays were swallowed by. 

None of us knew, as they took us 
into the artificial light of the cinema, 
that they walked the path of the pin setter, 
the blacksmith or elevator operator, 
professions reduced to curiosity 

by wandering time. Only in the quick steps 
of floor salesmen, the slim backs of hostesses 
bringing us to our tables, do they remain, 
the artful flutters of their flashlights lost 
in dark we are left to find our own way through."
47,Dio Ed Io,Charles Wright,"There is a heaviness between us,   
Nameless, raised from the void, that counts out the sprung hours.   
What ash has it come to purify?   
What disappearance, like water, does it lift up to the clouds?   

God of my fathers, but not of mine,   
You are a part, it is said, an afterthought, a scattered one.   
There is a disappearance between us as heavy as dirt.   
What figure of earth and clay would it have me become?   

Sunday again, January thaw back big time.   
The knock-kneed, overweight boys and girls   
Sit on the sun-warmed concrete sidewalk outside the pharmacy   
Smoking their dun-filtered cigarettes.   

Nothing is bothering them—and their nicotine dreams—   
This afternoon. Everything's weightless,   
As insubstantial as smoke.   
Nothing is disappearing in their world. Arrival is all.   

There is a picture of Yves Klein leaping out of a window   
Above a cobblestone Paris street.   
A man on a bicycle peddles away toward the distance.   
One of them's you, the other is me.   

Cut out of the doctored photograph, however, the mesh net   
Right under the swan-diving body.   
Cut out of another print, the black-capped, ever-distancing cyclist, as well as the mesh net.   
Hmm . . . And there you have it, two-fingered sleight-of-hand man.   

One loses one's center in the air, trying to stay afloat,   
Doesn't one? Snowfalling metaphors.   
Unbidden tears, the off-size of small apples. Unshed.   
And unshedable.   

Such heaviness. The world has come and lies between us.   
Such distance. Ungraspable.   
Ash and its disappearance—   
Unbearable absence of being,   
                                           Tonto, then taken back."
48,Diorama,Atsuro Riley,"The Blue Hole Summer Fair, set up and spread out like a butterfly pinned down on paper. Twin bright-lit wings, identically shaped (and fenced) and sized. 

    This side holds the waffled-tin (and oven-hot) huts of the Home Arts Booths and Contests, the hay-sweet display-cages for the 4-H livestock, the streamer-hung display-stages where girl-beauties twirl and try for queen. There's rosette-luster (and -lusting), and the marching band wearing a hole in Sousa. And (pursed) gaggles and clutches of feather-white neighbor-women, eyeballing us like we're pig's feet in a jar. 
                         I wonder does her boy talk Chinese? 
                                           You ever seen that kind of black-headed? 
                                                             Blue shine all in it like a crow.  

    This other wing (the one I'm back-sneaking, side-slipping, turnstiling into) dips and slopes down to low-lying marsh-mire: whiffs of pluff-mud stink and live gnat-pack poison, carnie-cots and -trailers camped on ooze. They've got (rickety) rides, and tent-shows with stains, and rackety bare-bulbed stalls of Hoop-La Game (RING-A-COKE!) and Rebel Yell and Shoot the Gook Down. Stand here, on this smutch-spot: don't these mirrors show you strange? 

    Crowds are gathering. Yonder there and down, the yolk-glow of a tent is drawing men on (and in) the way a car-crash does, or a cockfight sure enough, or neon. The ticket-boy's getting mobbed at the fly of the door. 
         No sign in sight, except for the X of the Dixie-flag ironed across his t-shirt. 
         I am bone-broke but falling into line. 
         The men upwind of me are leaking chaw-spit and pennies. 
         That, plus the eye-hunger spreading like a rumor through the swarm. 
         The rib-skinny doorkeeper's hollering: bet now, bout's bout startin! 
         Over his shoulder, a ropy yellow light. 
         Also: circles of white tobacco-smoke, and bleacher-rows of (cooncalling) men who know my daddy. 
         —And there he is, up in front with some tall man, iron-arming two black-chested boys toward the ring."
49,The Dipper,Kathleen Jamie,"It was winter, near freezing,
I'd walked through a forest of firs
when I saw issue out of the waterfall
a solitary bird.

It lit on a damp rock,
and, as water swept stupidly on,
wrung from its own throat
supple, undammable song.

It isn't mine to give.
I can't coax this bird to my hand
that knows the depth of the river
yet sings of it on land."
50,Disgraceland,Mary Karr,"Before my first communion, I clung to doubt 
      as Satan spider-like stalked 
           the orb of dark surrounding Eden 

for a wormhole into paradise. 
     God had formed me from gel in my mother’s womb, 
           injected by my dad’s smart shoot. 

They swapped sighs until 
      I came, smaller than a bite of burger. 
           Quietly, I grew till my lungs were done 

then the Lord sailed a soul 
      like a lit arrow to inhabit me. 
           Maybe that piercing 

made me howl at birth, 
      or the masked creatures whose scalpel 
           cut a lightning bolt to free me. 

I was hoisted by the heels and swatted, fed 
      and hauled around. Time-lapse photos show 
           my fingers grow past crayon outlines, 

my feet come to fill spike heels. 
      Eventually, I lurched out 
           to kiss the wrong mouths, get stewed, 

and sulk around. Christ always stood 
      to one side with a glass of water. 
           I swatted the sap away. 

When my thirst got great enough to ask, 
      a clear stream welled up inside, 
           some jade wave buoyed me forward, 

and I found myself upright 
      in the instant, with a garden 
           inside my own ribs aflourish. 

There, the arbor leafs. 
      The vines push out plump grapes. 
           You are loved, someone said. Take that 

           and eat it."
51,Dismantling the House,Stephen Dunn,"Rent a flatbed with a winch.
With the right leverage
anything can be hoisted, driven off.

Or the man with a Bobcat comes in,
then the hauler with his enormous truck.
A leveler or a lawyer does the rest;

experts always are willing to help.
The structure was old, rotten in spots.
Hadn't it already begun to implode?

Believe you've just sped the process up.
Photographs, toys, the things that break
your heart—let's trust

they would have been removed,
perhaps are safe with the children
who soon will have children of their own.

It's over. It's time for loss to build
its tower in the yard where you
are merely a spectator now.

Admit you'd like to find something
discarded or damaged, even gone,
and lift it back into the world."
52,Dog Music,Paul Zimmer,"Amongst dogs are listeners and singers.
My big dog sang with me so purely,
puckering her ruffled lips into an O,
beginning with small, swallowing sounds
like Coltrane musing, then rising to power
and resonance, gulping air to continue—
her passion and sense of flawless form—
singing not with me, but for the art of dogs.
We joined in many fine songs—""Stardust,""
""Naima,"" ""The Trout,"" ""My Rosary,"" ""Perdido.""
She was a great master and died young,
leaving me with unrelieved grief,
her talents known to only a few.

Now I have a small dog who does not sing,
but listens with discernment, requiring
skill and spirit in my falsetto voice.
I sing her name and words of love
 andante, con brio, vivace, adagio.
Sometimes she is so moved she turns
to place a paw across her snout,
closes her eyes, sighing like a girl
I held and danced with years ago.

But I am a pretender to dog music.
The true strains rise only from
the rich, red chambers of a canine heart,
these melodies best when the moon is up,
listeners and singers together or
apart, beyond friendship and anger,
far from any human imposter—
ballads of long nights lifting
to starlight, songs of bones, turds,
conquests, hunts, smells, rankings,
things settled long before our birth."
53,A Dog's Life,Daniel Groves,"A stay of execution: one last day, 
your day, old Everydog, then, as they say, 
or as we say (a new trick to avoid 
finalities implicit in destroyed), 
you have to be put down, or put to sleep— 
the very dog who, once, would fight to keep 
from putting down, despite our shouts, a shoe 
until he gnawed it to the sole, and who 
would sit up, through our sleepless nights, to bark 
away some menace looming in the dark. 

Can you pick up the sense of all this talk? 
Or do you still just listen for a walk, 
or else, the ultimate reward, a car?— 
My God, tomorrow's ride . . . Well, here we are, 
right now. You stare at me and wag your tail. 
I stare back, dog-like, big and dumb. Words fail. 
No more commands, ignore my monologue, 
go wander off. Good dog. You're a good dog. 
And you could never master, anyway, 
the execution, as it were, of Stay"
54,The Dowser’s Ear,Wilmer Mills,"Empty cattle trailers 
               Rumbled dummy thunder 
Down the road all day, and now tonight, 
Heat lightning flashes more of the same fake rain. 
It’s just as well. I couldn’t get to sleep, 
And now it ricochets across the sky 
With empty loads of light. We’ve had a month 
Of drought that tightens dirt around my pond. 
The local wells are dry. But I’ve retired, 
Threw out my wand. I hate this time of year. 
            
               Roux can burn if flour 
               Sticks in skillet butter. 
I’ve been cooking up a storm myself, 
My Daddy’s filé gumbo recipe. 
He used to be a chef on oil rigs 
Until the hurricane. I heard the waves 
That killed him, and I hear them every year. 
It’s emptiness that fills me. That’s my skill. 
I hear the vacant rain before it falls. 
It’s like the murmur of a spiraled shell. 
         
               Hurricane weather, stewing 
               Deep for landfall, spewing 
Rain-a-plenty in the Gulf and here 
In Tennessee they always have a lack 
Of something. Two men called today for wells. 
I told them both to go to hell, and now 
They think I’m sinful, not to use my skill. 
They stand to lose so much, but don’t we all. 
I lost a lot in Hurricane Camille 
And even now can’t hear the end of it. 

               More heat lightning flashes, 
               Absent rain that passes 
Over clouds, and I can make it out, 
Each gurgling current under withered fields, 
Down kitchen drains. The neighbors think I’m crazy, 
Up all hours, but they’ll never know 
The screaming voice inside a breaker’s rage 
Or how it simmers in my ear. I hate 
The sound of water. Give me one good chance 
To make it silent. I’d be right as rain."
55,Dream of the Huntress,Robin Robertson,"It is always the same: 
she is standing over me 

in the forest clearing, 
a dab of blood on her cheek 

from a rabbit or a deer. 
I am aware of nothing 

but my mutinous flesh, 
and the traps of desire 

sent to test it— 
her bare arms, bare 

shoulders, her loosened hair, 
the hard, high breasts, 

and under a belt 
of knives and fish-lures, 

her undressed wound. 
Every night the same: 

the slashed fetlock, 
the buckling under; 

I wake in her body 
broken, like a gun."
56,Driving West in 1970,Robert Bly,"My dear children, do you remember the morning
When we climbed into the old Plymouth
And drove west straight toward the Pacific?

We were all the people there were.
We followed Dylan's songs all the way west.
It was Seventy; the war was over, almost;

And we were driving to the sea.
We had closed the farm, tucked in
The flap, and were eating the honey

Of distance and the word ""there.""
 Oh whee, we're gonna fly
 Down into the easy chair. We sang that

Over and over. That's what the early
Seventies were like. We weren't afraid.
And a hole had opened in the world.

We laughed at Las Vegas.
There was enough gaiety
For all of us, and ahead of us was

The ocean. Tomorrow's
 The day my bride's gonna come.
And the war was over, almost."
57,During the Service,Carrie Grabo,"How strange my lack of faith must seem to you. 
I see the way your god provides a cradle for your grief; 
how lovely to be certain that the ancient story's true. 

You sang the hymns as if each word were new—
At last, you sang, at last in Your / Eternal arms I'll find relief 
(how strange my lack of faith must seem to you)—

while I kept drifting, lost in the refrains and in the blue 
fragility the tinted glass provided us to bow beneath 
(how lovely to be certain that the ancient story's true). 

Beneath that moderated sky we rose and sang and cried on cue; 
familiar words were read to keep our sorrow brief 
(how sad my lack of faith must seem to you); 

the book upon the altar and the hymnals in each pew 
held pages edged in fine gold leaf—
how lovely seeing that the ancient story's true—

and I was wondering just what it cost to see this vaulting through: 
the ceilings, windows, ornament; the engineering of belief . . . 

But let my lack of faith seem strange to you! 
You're lovely certain that the ancient story's true."
58,Earthly Meditations,Robert Wrigley,"The Afterlife

1

Spring, and the first full crop of dandelions gone
to smoke, the lawn lumpish with goldfinches,
hunched in their fluffs, fattened by seed,
alight in the wind-bared peduncular forest.
Little bells, they loop and dive, bend
the delicate birch branches down.
I would enter the sky through the soil
myself, sing up the snail bowers
and go on the lam with the roots.
Licked by filaments, I would lie,
a billion love-mouths to suckle and feed.

Where the river will be next week,
a puddle two trout go savagely dying in.
Notice the bland, Darwinian sand: bone wrack
and tree skin, the ground down moon bowls
of mussels, viral stones dividing like mold.
At twelve, I buried the frog because it was dead
and dug it up because I'd been dreaming—
a fish belly light, a lowly chirruped chorus
of amens. I thought my nights might smell of hell.

Bland, hum-drum, quotidian guilt—
if I've killed one frog, I've killed two.
Saint Rot and the sacraments of maggots:
knowing is humus and sustenance is sex.
It accrues and accrues, it stews
tumorous with delight. Tomorrow's
a shovelful, the spit of the cosmos, one day
the baby's breath is no longer a rose."
63,Escaped Housewife Prefers the Term Cosmetologist,Karen Craigo,"Quasi-scientific? Maybe. 
But think of beautician, 
a word that assumes loveliness 
is brought off by technology. 

She prefers cosmetologist— 
how it seems to have something 
to do with the stars. She believes 
she can see the future 
when she stares face-down 
at the globe of a stranger's scalp 
and adjusts the tilt of his head. 

At the Academy, she is learning 
about the tendencies of things 
to remain where they fall. 
She knows some tricks— 
spritz and gel, the so-called 
permanent wave. She wonders 
where they come from, 
this galaxy of dowdy customers. 

Some days her precision cuts 
hang like torn drapes 
on a dirty window. 
I see you've tried 
an asymmetrical look, 
her instructor might say, 
snipping corrections. 
At the Academy, asymmetrical 
is spelled with a D. 

She came here to verify 
what she always suspected: 
that straight hair must be curled, 
curly hair straightened, 
long hair cut, short hair extended. 
That what comes to us by fate 
is wrong."
64,Eschatology of the Lexicon,J. Allyn Rosser,"They come down to us  
rounding the corners of centuries  
at an innocent jog, shedding letters  
and most of the grand old meanings  
to take on the sleek new hide  
our day demands, a snappier  
nap that can repel the stare  
of a rather less tactful sun;  

they come down to us com-  
pounding, bounding in idiot  
joy, they come with that trustful  
tired old mutt look, that soft woof,  
warm doggie sigh on the knee,  
hoping for what? Some reason,  
no doubt, to continue sounding.  
Give me one good reason,  

they come down to us saying,  
as if we could have one without them."
65,Eve's Design,Moira Linehan,"Then there's the Yemeni legend  
of Eve in the Garden knitting  
a pattern on the serpent's back,  
the snake unfinished like the rest  
of creation, the first woman  
thinking to add design, a sheath  
of interlocking diamonds and stripes  
along that sensuous S,  
knitting giving her time to learn  
what's infinitely possible  
with a few stitches, twisting cables,  
hers a plan to mirror the divine  
inner layer that can't be shed  
no matter what it rubs up against."
66,Every Day We Are Dancers,Mitch Roberson,"It begins with the lewd macarena  
each of us performs in the shower,  
then the modified twist we are hip to  
with that ever-absorbent partner, the towel,  

and on to the funky chicken of stepping into underwear,  
the shimmy of stretching into hose.  
There is no music, none that anyone  
can hear, yet no one can escape the boogie.  

Outside beneath the disco ball of the Sun  
no one is a wallflower, not even the two lugs  
in the crosswalk lugging a huge mirror,  
one at either end pressing his cheek  

into the cheek of his own reflection, arm  
extended, hand clasping his own hand in a tango  
more about control than passion, one couple  
leading himself forward, the other slide-stepping  

backwards across the intersection made double  
by the infinite burden they shoulder together.  
At the entrances of buildings even those afflicted  
with two left feet find grace with a stranger  

in a revolving door, where, regardless of gender,  
we share a pause and glance to communicate  
who will lead, who will follow,  
close to each other but never quite touching."
67,The Extension of the Dead,Gary Fincke,"Getting drunk, a friend called women 
He had slept with, men he hated, 
And then 911, repeating 
""Emergency"" like a schoolboy. 

""Try 999,"" I suggested, 
Giving him the hot-line number 
That Malaysians, once, imagined 
Was the extension of the dead, 

Their calls, instead, directed to 
The homes for police and firemen 
And medical help, dispatchers 
Picking up for thousands who thought, 

Immediately, they had linked 
With the calm voices of the dead. 
Cautions? Disclaimers? Those callers, 
Regardless, asked about heaven's 

Lifestyle, what it meant to be dead. 
They chanted incantations to 
Ward off whatever might travel 
Through phone lines from the afterlife. 

""What's the story with you,"" my friend 
Kept on repeating, receiving 
Sympathy, curses, threats, a fine. 
And the Malaysians? They, at last, 

Asked for help with the lottery— 
Because surely the selfless dead 
Knew the winning numbers, the sort 
Of thing you heard in paradise."
68,Fable,Tom Sleigh,"A little village in Texas has lost its idiot.
-Caption on a protest sign

Let us deal justly.
-Edgar, disguised as Poor Tom, from Shakespeare's King Lear; act 3, scene 6 

But where, oh where is the holy idiot,
truth teller and soothsayer, familiar

of spirits, rat eater, unhouseled wanderer
whose garble and babble fill rich and poor,

homeless and housed, with awe and fear?
Is he hiding in the pit of the walkie-talkie,

its grid of holes insatiably hungry,
almost like a baby, sucking in the police sergeant's

quiet voice as he calls in reinforcements?
Oh holy idiot, is that you sniffing the wind

for the warm turd smell on the mounted policemen
backing their horses' quivering, skittish

haunches into the demonstrators' faces?
Oh little village among the villages,

the wild man, the holy Bedlamite is gone,
and nobody, now, knows where to find him...

Lying in mud? lying caked in mud, hair elfed into knots?
Some poor mad Tom roving the heath

for a warm soft place to lie his body down,
his speech obsessed with oaths, demons,

his tongue calling forth the Foul Fiend, Flibbertigibbet
as the horses back slowly, slowly into the crowd

and he eats filth, he crams his ravenous mouth with filth—
and then he sits on his stool in the trampled hay

and deep-rutted mud, he anoints himself
with ashes and clay, he puts on his crown

of fumiter weed and holds his scepter
of a smouldering poker and calls the court to order."
69,THE FABRIC OF LIFE,Kay Ryan,"It is very stretchy.  
We know that, even if  
many details remain  
sketchy. It is complexly  
woven. That much too  
has pretty well been  
proven. We are loath  
to continue our lessons  
which consist of slaps  
as sharp and dispersed  
as bee stings from  
a smashed nest  
when any strand snaps— 

hurts working far past  
the locus of rupture,  
attacking threads  
far beyond anything  
we would have said  
connects."
70,Faith,Linda Pastan,"For Ira

With the seal of science 
emblazoned 
on your forehead, 
like the old Good Housekeeping 
Seal of Approval, 
I believe what you tell me 
about cells and molecules, 
though I can't see them. 

And though the language you speak 
is full of numbers and symbols 
I'll never understand; 
though your tie is askew 
and your hair unruly, still I believe 
what you say about the size of the universe, 
which is either expanding or contracting, 
I've forgotten which already. 

So if tomorrow you tell me 
you made a small miscalculation, 
that God indeed created the world 
in 6 short days, then rested on the 7th, 
that it was Eve who landed us 
in all this trouble, I would believe you. 
I would believe you 
as I've always done before."
71,Far Company,W. S. Merwin,"At times now from some margin of the day
I can hear birds of another country
not the whole song but a brief phrase of it
out of a music that I may have heard
once in a moment I appear to have
forgotten for the most part that full day
no sight of which I can remember now
though it must have been where my eyes were then
that knew it as the present while I thought
of somewhere else without noticing that
singing when it was there and still went on
whether or not I noticed now it falls
silent when I listen and leaves the day
and flies before it to be heard again
somewhere ahead when I have forgotten"
72,February,Bill Christophersen,"The cold grows colder, even as the days 
grow longer, February's mercury vapor light 
buffing but not defrosting the bone-white 
ground, crusty and treacherous underfoot. 
This is the time of year that's apt to put 
a hammerlock on a healthy appetite, 
old anxieties back into the night, 
insomnia and nightmares into play; 
when things in need of doing go undone 
and things that can't be undone come to call, 
muttering recriminations at the door, 
and buried ambitions rise up through the floor 
and pin your wriggling shoulders to the wall; 
and hope's a reptile waiting for the sun."
73,Felix Crow,Kay Ryan,"Crow school
is basic and
short as a rule—
just the rudiments
of quid pro crow
for most students.
Then each lives out
his unenlightened
span, adding his
bit of blight
to the collected
history of pushing out
the sweeter species;
briefly swaggering the
swagger of his
aggravating ancestors
down my street.
And every time
I like him
when we meet."
74,First Job,Joseph Campana,"All evening I hunted 
the bird that wanted 
a cage of glass, 
here where cemetery 
slides into creek, fronting 
what was once the largest 
indoor leather mill in the world. 
There the skins gathered 
for cleansing, coloring, 
scraping, shipping off. 

It closed three years after 
a lone sparrow set up camp 
behind the only desk 
in the only full-serve 
service station left in town 
where, from four to seven 
nightly one summer, 
I blackened the pages 
of books with my thumbs. 

Whatever it sought there— 
thumping its frightened body 
against glass, into cabinets 
or out to the bays 
scrubbed raw with gasoline 
where the broken waited 
to be raised up, hosed off, 
fastened together in hope 
of coughing to life again— 
whatever it sought was not a dollar 
slipped through a window cracked 
because patronage was right 
for the aging ladies of August to provide 
from Chryslers cool in the sun. 

There was nothing to be found 
in books or boxes of parts. 
And the tools hanging from pegs 
were as useless as my hands, 
which could not patch together 
those straggling conveyances 
any more than I could 
with a tattered broom 
batter the bird to freedom 
as I swung at fluttering terror 
as I sought with useless devices 
some fortune reposed 
in corners of grease and dust."
75,Firstborn,Kurt S. Olsson,"In the end, he has to teach them everything, 
even death, as he finds them that night by the fire, 
giggling and buzzing more like brother and sister 
than father and mother, waiting for him to bring 
meat for the evening meal, not noticing 
the gore matting the hair to his arms and chest, 
no more surprised than the first time they'd laid eyes 
on him when he'd slipped like a small, thrashing 
gift from the net of his mother. For days, they'd left him 
in the same place where he'd fallen, alone, around him 
a pile of rotting fruit they kept adding to. His cries 
had puzzled then delighted them until he finally 
grew weary of their laughter and of waiting and crawled 
to where his mother lay by the fire, his nose knowing 
the way to her dugs, untended, leaking and already 
sour, and he'd clamped his jaw down so hard 
he tasted blood in the first warm suck, 
this act taken not so much in anger or in hunger, 
but as a way to announce his presence. Now, 
they blink at him through the flames, and he isn't 
sure they even know which of the two he is. 
When he explains, they nod yes, smiling, 
as if he were the herald of a new mystery, 
a coming storm or a fire in the mountains. 
When he leads them to where his brother lies 
a dry, broken stalk among the rocks, they nod again, 
still smiling but unsure now, so he must lift his brother 
again, cradle his shallow bones against his chest, 
the head worn into the nook under his neck, 
and draw the knife again, just as he's done 
a thousand times before, always 
as if in practice not for the murder itself, 
but for this dumb show for mother and father. 
The blade finds the wound, flicks past his own throat, 
and he hears again the sound a soul makes leaking 
from a body, but there is no blood this time, 
he must give them all, blood and thunder and retribution,
he must teach them everything, even life, 
so only when he hurtles out into the night 
does he hear the first cry, his, not theirs, the sobs 
rippling out, lapping over and through him, until 
they are enormous, pitiless, no longer his, but the maw 
of a god who will damn but never devour him."
76,Fish of the Flood,Emilia Stuart Lorimer,"Fish of the flood, on the bankèd billow
          Thou layest thy head in dreams;
Sliding as slides thy shifting pillow,
          One with the streams
                    Of the sea is thy spirit.

Gean-tree, thou spreadest thy foaming flourish
          Abroad in the sky so grey;
It not heeding if it thee nourish,
          Thou dost obey,
                    Happy, its moving.

So, God, thy love it not needeth me,
Only thy life, that I blessèd be."
77,The Fisherman,William Butler Yeats,"Although I can see him still— 
The freckled man who goes 
To a gray place on a hill 
In gray Connemara clothes 
At dawn to cast his flies— 
It's long since I began 
To call up to the eyes 
This wise and simple man.  
All day I'd looked in the face  
What I had hoped it would be  
To write for my own race  
And the reality:  
The living men that I hate,  
The dead man that I loved,  
The craven man in his seat,  
The insolent unreproved— 
And no knave brought to book  
Who has won a drunken cheer— 
The witty man and his joke  
Aimed at the commonest ear,  
The clever man who cries  
The catch cries of the clown,  
The beating down of the wise  
And great Art beaten down. 

Maybe a twelve-month since 
Suddenly I began, 
In scorn of this audience, 
Imagining a man, 
And his sun-freckled face 
And gray Connemara cloth, 
Climbing up to a place 
Where stone is dark with froth, 
And the down turn of his wrist 
When the flies drop in the stream— 
A man who does not exist,  
A man who is but a dream;  
And cried, “Before I am old  
I shall have written him one  
Poem maybe as cold  
And passionate as the dawn.”"
78,Fishing,A.E. Stallings,"The two of them stood in the middle water,
The current slipping away, quick and cold,
The sun slow at his zenith, sweating gold,
Once, in some sullen summer of father and daughter.
Maybe he regretted he had brought her—
She'd rather have been elsewhere, her look told—
Perhaps a year ago, but now too old.
Still, she remembered lessons he had taught her:
To cast towards shadows, where the sunlight fails
And fishes shelter in the undergrowth.
And when the unseen strikes, how all else pales
Beside the bright-dark struggle, the rainbow wroth,
Life and death weighed in the shining scales,
The invisible line pulled taut that links them both."
79,Fog Horns,David Mason,"The loneliest days,   
damp and indistinct,   
sea and land a haze.   
   
And purple fog horns   
blossomed over tides—   
bruises being born   
   
in silence, so slow,   
so out there, around,   
above and below.   
   
In such hurts of sound   
the known world became   
neither flat nor round.   
   
The steaming tea pot   
was all we fathomed   
of   is  and   is not .   
   
The hours were hallways   
with doors at the ends   
opened into days   
   
fading into night   
and the scattering   
particles of light.   
   
Nothing was done then.   
Nothing was ever   
done. Then it was done."
80,For a Student Sleeping in a Poetry Workshop,David Wagoner,"I've watched his eyelids sag, spring open 
   Vaguely and gradually go sliding 
      Shut again, fly up 
With a kind of drunken surprise, then wobble 
   Peacefully together to send him 
      Home from one school early. Soon his lashes 
Flutter in REM sleep. I suppose he's dreaming 
   What all of us kings and poets and peasants 
      Have dreamed: of not making the grade, 
Of draining the inexhaustible horn cup 
   Of the cerebral cortex where ganglions 
      Are ganging up on us with more connections 
Than atoms in heaven, but coming up once more 
   Empty. I see a clear stillness 
      Settle over his face, a calming of the surface 
Of water when the wind dies. Somewhere 
   Down there, he's taking another course 
      Whose resonance (let's hope) resembles 
The muttered thunder, the gutter bowling, the lightning 
   Of minor minions of Thor, the groans and gurgling 
      Of feral lovers and preliterate Mowglis, the songs 
Of shamans whistled through bird bones. A worried neighbor 
   Gives him the elbow, and he shudders 
      Awake, recollects himself, brings back 
His hands from aboriginal outposts, 
   Takes in new light, reorganizes his shoes, 
      Stands up in them at the buzzer, barely recalls 
His books and notebooks, meets my eyes 
   And wonders what to say and whether to say it, 
      Then keeps it to himself as today's lesson."
81,For Allen Ginsberg,X J Kennedy,"Ginsberg, Ginsberg, burning bright,   
Taunter of the ultra right,   
What blink of the Buddha’s eye   
Chose the day for you to die?

Queer pied piper, howling wild,
Mantra-minded flower child,   
Queen of Maytime, misrule’s lord   
Bawling, Drop out! All aboard!

Finger-cymbaled, chanting Om,
Foe of fascist, bane of bomb,
Proper poets’ thorn-in-side,
Turner of a whole time’s tide,

Who can fill your sloppy shoes?
What a catch for Death. We lose
Glee and sweetness, freaky light,
Ginsberg, Ginsberg, burning bright."
82,FOR GRANT WOOD,Margaret Mackinnon,"""The trees are mended.""

A shy man seeks perfection in his art:
 Across vast acres, color and shape of tidiness,
 Iowa's unruly grass submits, blade by blade.
 The blue of Mother's dishes tints the sky.

Across vast acres, color and shape of tidiness,
 sloping rows and rectangles piece a new land.
 The blue of Mother's dishes tints the sky.
 Like a black quilt tied with loops of green, 

sloping rows and rectangles piece the new land.
 The reassuring fields of corn unfold
 like black quilts tied with loops of green.
 Under the artist's alchemy, 

the reassuring fields of corn unfold.
 Sweet clouds hover like the hands of God.
 Under the artist's alchemy,
 even winter's leaden skies grow bright. 

Sweet clouds hover like the hands of God
 as the Thirties' skylines and bread lines disappear.
 Even winter's leaden skies grow bright.
 A yellow hill rises, like the belly of a woman ripe with child, 

as the skylines and bread lines disappear.
 Iowa's unruly grass submits, blade by blade,
 a yellow hill rises—
 and the shy man finds perfection in his art."
83,For Laurel and Hardy on My Workroom Wall,David Wagoner,"They’re tipping their battered derbies and striding forward 
   In step for a change, chipper, self-assured, 
      Their cardboard suitcases labeled 
Guest of Steerage. They’ve just arrived at the boot camp 
   Of the good old French Foreign Legion 
      Which they’ve chosen as their slice of life 
Instead of drowning themselves. Once again 
   They’re about to become their own mothers and fathers 
      And their own unknowable children 
Who will rehearse sad laughter and mock tears, 
   Will frown with completely unsuccessful 
      Concentration, and will practice the amazement 
Of suddenly understanding everything 
   That baffles them and will go on baffling them 
      While they pretend they’re only one reel away 
From belonging in the world. Their arrival 
   Will mark a new beginning of meaningless 
      Hostilities with a slaphappy ending. In a moment, 
They’ll hear music, and as if they’d known all along 
   This was what they’d come for, they’ll put down 
      The mops and buckets given them as charms 
With which to cleanse the Sahara and move their feet 
   With a calm, sure, delicate disregard 
      For all close-order drill and begin dancing."
84,"For Micha's Mother, Who Signs",Robert A. Fink,"It is not poetry you fear, but poets, 
their indelible brand 
of words. How will your daughter 
escape the mark men hanged 
young women for in Salem? 
I am nothing more than a teacher, 
like you. See, I have removed 
my shoes and socks. I am rolling 
my trousers above my ankles. 
No cloven hooves. Long feet and toes 
like you and your beautiful daughter. 

It is language that has won 
her over, earth-bound words 
walking orderly across the page 
like children holding to 
the rope attached to your wrist, 
teacher and students 
traversing the noisy street 
at the crosswalk, with the light 
of your fingers composing 
the line your children read, 
each syllable's afterimage trailing 
your quick passage of hands 
conducting the boys and girls 
safely from one curb to the other."
85,"Frame, an Epistle",Claudia Emerson,"Most of the things you made for me—blanket- 
chest, lapdesk, the armless rocker—I gave 
away to friends who could use them and not 
be reminded of the hours lost there, 
not having been witness to those designs, 
the tedious finishes. But I did keep 
the mirror, perhaps because like all mirrors, 
most of these years it has been invisible, 
part of the wall, or defined by reflection— 
safe—because reflection, after all, does change. 
I hung it here in the front, dark hallway 
of this house you will never see, so that 
it might magnify the meager light, 
become a lesser, backward window. No one 
pauses long before it. But this morning, 
as I put on my overcoat, then straightened 
my hair, I saw outside my face its frame 
you made for me, admiring for the first 
time the way the cherry you cut and planed 
yourself had darkened, just as you said it would."
86,from [From Une histoire de bleu / From A Story of Blue],Jean-Michel Maulpoix,"LE REGARD BLEU 

Nous connaissons par ouï-dire l'existence de l'amour. 

Assis sur un rocher ou sous un parasol rouge, allongés dans le pré bourdonnant d'insectes, les deux mains sous la nuque, agenouillés dans la fraîcheur et l'obscurité d'une église, ou tassés sur une chaise de paille entre les quatre murs de la chambre, tête basse, les yeux fixés sur un rectangle de papier blanc, nous rêvons à des estuaires, des tumultes, des ressacs, des embellies et des marées. Nous écoutons monter en nous le chant inépuisable de la mer qui dans nos têtes afflue puis se retire, comme revient puis s'éloigne le curieux désir que nous avons du ciel, de l'amour, et de tout ce que nous ne pourrons jamais toucher des mains. 

• 

La mer en nous essaie des phrases. 

Depuis des lustres, la même voix épelle le même alphabet dans le même cerveau d'enfant. Elle balbutie des mots vite envolés, accrochés aux herbes des plages, à la peau brunie des baigneurs, à la proue des barques, aux mâtures. Des mots quelconques, pour rien et pour quiconque. Il n'y est question que de l'amour. C'est pourquoi nous ne savons trop que dire et souffrons que le regard d'autrui s'attarde sur notre visage quand nous voudrions qu'il se pose à même notre cœur. Nos lèvres sont si maladroites, notre corps invisible dans la nuit opaque, et nos mains mal-habiles, des éclairs ou des ailes pourtant au bout des doigts. 

from A Story of Blue

THE BLUE LOOK 

We know through hearsay that love exists. 

Seated on a rock or under a red parasol, lying in the field buzzing with insects, our hands clasped behind our necks, kneeling in the cool darkness of a church, or settled on a straw chair within the four walls of the bedroom, head lowered, eyes fixed on a rectangle of white paper, we dream of estuaries, tumultuous surf, clearing weather and tides. We listen to the inexhaustible chant of the sea within us, as it rises and falls in our heads, like the approach and retreat of the strange desire we have for heaven, for love, and all that we cannot touch with our hands. 

• 

Within us the sea tries out sentences. 

From time immemorial, the same voice spells the same alphabet in the same child's brain. It mutters words which quickly fly off, snagged on the sea grasses, on the bathers' browned skin, on the bows of boats, on the masts. Ordinary words, for nothing and no one in particular. It is only about love. This is why we hardly know what to say and we suffer when someone's gaze fixes on our face, when we would like it to look into our heart. Our lips are so awkward, our body invisible in the opaque night, and our hands inept, yet lightening flashes or wings are at our fingertips."
87,Full Flight,Bob Hicok,"I'm in a plane that will not be flown into a building.
It's a SAAB 340, seats 40, has two engines with propellers
is why I think of beanies, those hats that would spin
a young head into the clouds. The plane is red and loud
inside like it must be loud in the heart, red like fire
and fire engines and the woman two seats up and to the right
resembles one of the widows I saw on TV after the Towers
came down. It's her hair that I recognize, the fecundity of it
and the color and its obedience to an ideal, the shape
it was asked several hours ago to hold and has held, a kind
of wave that begins at the forehead and repeats with slight
variations all the way to the tips, as if she were water
and a pebble had been continuously dropped into the mouth
of her existence. We are eighteen thousand feet over America.
People are typing at their laps, blowing across the fog of coffee,
sleeping with their heads on the windows, on the pattern
of green fields and brown fields, streams and gas stations
and swimming pools, blue dots of aquamarine that suggest
we've domesticated the mirage. We had to kill someone,
I believe, when the metal bones burned and the top
fell through the bottom and a cloud made of dust and memos
and skin muscled across Manhattan. I remember feeling
I could finally touch a rifle, that some murders
are an illumination of ethics, that they act as a word,
a motion the brain requires for which there is
no syllable, no breath. The moment the planes had stopped,
when we were afraid of the sky, there was a pause
when we could have been perfectly American,
could have spent infinity dollars and thrown a million
bodies at finding the few, lasering our revenge
into a kind of love, the blood-hunger kept exact
and more convincing for its precision, an expression
of our belief that proximity is never the measure of guilt.
We've lived in the sky again for some years and today
on my lap these pictures from Iraq, naked bodies
stacked into a pyramid of ha-ha and the articles
about broomsticks up the ass and the limbs of children
turned into stubble, we are punch-drunk and getting even
with the sand, with the map, with oil, with ourselves
I think listening to the guys behind me. There's a problem
in Alpena with an inventory control system, some switches
are being counted twice, switches for what I don't know—
switches of humor, of faith—but the men are musical
in their jargon, both likely born in New Delhi
and probably Americans now, which is what the flesh
of this country has been, a grafted pulse, an inventory
of the world, and just as the idea of embrace
moves chemically into my blood, and I'm warmed
as if I've just taken a drink, a voice announces
we've begun our descent, and then I sense the falling."
88,Funny Strange,Jennifer Michael Hecht,"We are tender and our lives are sweet

and they are already over and we are
visiting them in some kind of endless
reprieve from oblivion, we are walking
around in them and after we shatter
with love for everything we settle in.

Thou tiger on television chowing,
thou very fact of dreams, thou majestical
roof fretted with golden fire. Thou wisdom
of the inner parts. Thou tintinnabulation.

Is it not sweet to hand over the ocean's
harvest in a single wave of fish? To bounce
a vineyard of grapes from one's apron
and into the mouth of the crowd? To scoop up
bread and offer up one's armful to the throng?
Let us live as if we were still among

the living, let our days be patterned after
theirs. Is it not marvelous to be forgetful?"
89,Glory,Robert Pinsky,"Pindar, poet of the victories, fitted names   
And legends into verses for the chorus to sing:   
Names recalled now only in the poems of Pindar:   

O nearly unpronounceable immortals,   
In the dash, Oionos was champion:   
Oionos, Likmynios's son, who came from Midea.   
In wrestling, Echemos won—the name   
Of his home city, Tegea, proclaimed to the crowds.   
Doryklos of Tiryns won the prize in boxing,   
And the record for a four-horse team was set   
By Samos from Mantinea, Halirothios's son.   

And Pindar, poet of the Olympian and Isthmian   
And Pythian games, wrote also of the boundless   
And forgetful savannas of time. What is someone? 
The chorus sing in a victory ode—What is a nobody? 

Creatures of a day, they chant in answer, Creatures   
Of a day. So where is the godgiven glory Pindar says   
Settles on mortals?—Bright as gold among the substances,   
Say the chorus, paramount as water among the elements.   

Not in the victory itself, petty or great,   
Of rich young Greeks contending in games.   
Not in the poetry itself, with its forgotten dances   
And Pindar spinning among tiresome or stirring   
Myths and genealogies, the chanted names   
Of cities and invoked gods and dignitaries—   

Striving, O nearly unpronounceable athletes,   
To animate the air with dancing feet raising   
A golden pollen of dust: a pervasive blur   
Of seedlets in the sunlight, whirling—beyond mere   
Victory or applause or performance,   
As victory is beyond defeat.   

The one who threw the javelin furthest   
Sang the chorus, chanting Pindar's incantation   
Against envy and oblivion, was Phrastor.   
And when Nikeus grunting whirled the stone   
Into the air and it flew past the marks   
Of all the competitors, Nikeus's countrymen   
Shouted his name after it, Nikeus,   
Nikeus, and the syllables so say the lines Pindar   
Composed for the sweating chorus to chant—radiated   
For a spell like the silvery mirror of the moon."
90,The God of Inattention,Averill Curdy,"After the trumpets, after the incense   
There were nights insomnia fathered gods   
I then rejected as too angry or distracted,   
Or whose appetite for submission revealed   
Their own lack of faith.   Say our names,   
 All synonyms for trust. Others spoke   
In sugared paradox:  To know is to know   
All. To not know all is not to know. To know   
All requires that you know very little,   
But to know that little you have to know   
All . And for a while, it's true,   
I burned in the dark fires of ambivalence,   
My attention consumed like oxygen.   
I'd wake up tired, as I had with the married man   
Whose strictures and caprice begat,   
And begat, and begat, and begat   
My love for him, harvesting the same      
Silence from my bed. Who listens   
To my penitential tune? Who accepts   
My petitions for convenient parking,   
For spring, for the self illuminated   
Across a kitchen table, for . . . for   
Fortitude? I've heard a voice, I'm sure,   
Advising me to drop this sentimental farce.   
Only to hold the smoke of their names   
Again in my mouth I'd resurrect   
The dead, or adopt the gods orphaned   
By atheists, except the gods they've made   
From disbelief no one's faith could tolerate.   
Refusing to make the same mistake   
Just once, I've cried out to the dark   
Many names, most given up as routinely   
As the secrets of friends. If you're a cup      
Will my lips profane your own? If a comb      
Will I feel your teeth against my neck?      
If a wall I will be darker than your shadow.   
And if a door I will unlatch you, letting in   
All the little foxes from the vineyard."
91,Goldenrod,Ian Parks,"If I don't say it 
someone will: the wind 
blows through the goldenrod 
like death flows through a crowd. 
I watch it from a distance 
as the whole field lifts and stirs. 
Close up, it holds the promise 
of a less than perfect world. 
I knew the thing 
before I knew its name. 
Now all I know 
is what the name infers: 
a life of pure sensation 
or the rod some angel brings— 
announcing a momentous 
death or birth, each face 
expectant, brightly-lit. 
I say the name and what it means 
until the meaning blurs. 
The wind blows through the goldenrod 
like death flows through a crowd. 
Nothing is accomplished 
and the world is changed by it."
92,Habeas Corpus,Brian Swann,"Knots, a thousand lights, in  
   sheer dark, aimed at my window,  
tinny crystals, so mother dies  
   in my sleep. The snow turns  
coarse, goes out. An axe sounds  
   where I'd never heard an axe before.  
Breathing becomes dangerous. I can't  
   help it, making me her, even  
before I was born, her brain burning  
   out patterns I follow like will  
o' the wisps, sparks popping.  
   I put on heels and find I can balance,  
twist my spine, bend to get my seams  
   straight on my own, no one to  
call on, like she called me, sheer nylon  
   turning on sheer skin under my palms.  
I pull on the ratty musquash coat.  
   I have the body. I move off in it,  
eddying, trying to see who I am now.  
   I totter down the street thinking,  
one day he'll be sorry. And here I am.  
   Sorry. I watch her getting smaller  
up the road. I watch us both, till  
   nothing's all there is."
93,Hairless,Jo Shapcott,"Can the bald lie? The nature of the skin says not: 
it's newborn-pale, erection-tender stuff, 
every thought visible,—pure knowledge, 
mind in action—shining through the skull. 
I saw one, a woman, hairless absolute, cleaning. 
She mopped the green floor, dusted bookshelves, 
all cloth and concentration, Queen of the moon. 
You can tell, with the bald, that the air 
speaks to them differently, touches their heads 
with exquisite expression. As she danced 
her laundry dance with the motes, everything 
she ever knew skittered under her scalp. 
It was clear just from the texture of her head, 
she was about to raise her arms to the sky; 
I covered my ears as she prepared to sing, roar, 
to let the big win resonate in the little room."
94,Hartley Field,Connie Wanek,"And place is always and only place
And what is actual is actual only for one time
And only for one place . . .
T. S. Eliot

The wind cooled as it crossed the open pond
and drove little waves toward us,
brisk, purposeful waves
that vanished at our feet, such energy
thwarted by so little elevation.
The wind was endless, seamless,
old as the earth.
                           Insects came
to regard us with favor. I felt them alight,
felt their minute footfalls.
I was a challenge, an Everest . . .

And you, whom I have heard breathe all night,
sigh through the water of sleep
with vestigial gills . . .

A pair of dragonflies drifted past us, silent,
while higher up two bullet-shaped jets
dragged their roars behind them
on unbreakable chains. It seemed a pity
we’d given up the sky to them, but I understand so little.
Perhaps it was necessary.

All our years together—
and not just together. Surely by now
we have the same blood type, the same myopia.
Sometimes I think we’re the same sex,
the one in the middle of man and woman,
born of both as every child is.

The waves came to us, one each heartbeat,
and lay themselves at our feet.
The swelling goes down.
The fever cools.
There, where the Hartleys grew lettuce eighty years ago
bear and beaver, fox and partridge
den and nest and hunt
and are hunted. I wish I had the means
to give all the north back to itself, to let the pines
rise in the hayfield and the lilacs go wild.
But then where would we live?

I wanted that hour with you all winter—
I thought of it while I worked,
before I slept and when I woke,
a time when the tangled would straighten,
when contrition would become benediction:
the positive hour, shining like mica.
At last the wind brought it to us across the pond,
then took it up again, every last minute."
95,The Heart's Archaeology,Maudelle Driskell,"On some fundless expedition, 
you discover it beneath 
a pyracantha bush 
carved from the hip bone 
of a long-extinct herbivore 
that walked the plains on legs 
a story tall. An ocarina of bone 
drilled and shaped laboriously 
with tools too soft to be efficient 
by one primitive musician 
spending night after night 
squatting by the fire. 
No instrument of percussion: 
place this against your lips, 
fill it from your lungs to sound 
a note winding double helix, solo 
and thready calling to the pack."
96,Heat Wave,Samuel Menashe,"Sheets entangle him   
Naked on his bed   
Like a toppled mast   
Slack sails bedeck   
At sea, no ballast   
For that even keel   
He cannot keep— 
No steering wheel   
As he falls asleep"
98,"A HOPKINS RUMBLE, 1999",John Hazard,"For James Richardson

Gerard, juke-step Jerry, little wrestler, soul-mess 
of sinew and mind-sight, fired spark, joyed Jesuit, 
grief-clog too, but a Pan-flute in every Ave, you half-nelson 
the syntax dandies, ram them to canvas, sit upon and pin 

the god-fops, minions of ghost tomes, trite chimes, 
though you walk among them, too, jig and roar 
of black-robed stroll in golden-grove and choral iambs. 
You were, yes, that falcon flight, the labor, soar, and 

dive, but buzzard nose for carrion, too, sniffed your own, 
knew, alone, the rot, rope-knot or buckle of roots under-on 
rock, your gowned back to roses, rosaries, but eyes a song gone 
up, too, sickly little wings stuck in God-glue air: how long? 

You sang one dialectic flight, sir—the only kind. How high 
can the swallow swoop, how low the falcon grieve, relieve, 
in fall till pinions hold him, there, to kill? Light- 
weight, mutt, heaver of iron, scrap,feather: I believe 

the hurt, believe you saw what you saw."
99,Hour,Reginald Gibbons,"Sleepless
in the cold dark,
I look
through the closed dim
door be-
fore me, which be-
comes an
abyss into
which my
memories have
fallen
past laughter or
horror,
passion or hard
work—my
memories of
our past
laughter, horror,
passion,
hard work. An ache
of be-
ing. An ache of
being,
over love. An
ache of
being over
love. Like
projections on
the screen
of the heavy
window
curtains, flashing
lights of
a slow-scraping
after-
midnight snowplow

moment pulse in
this room."
100,The House Gift,Joanie Mackowski,"Egg-white house, old
ache in the rafters,
small as a button but
yearning for zero:
a sparrow parts the chimney
and veers for my face.
I wanted my nevers
again, my immaculate
touch-down to the durable
granite of love too
heavy to move: this
gift, implacable
bird's-eye sorrow
reared from the original
fairy tale's page—
I don't like it. I offered
no signature, my nature
altered, and I'm over
my hurricane. Rocking
room to room, this bird
threatens my gravity,
threaded through like a pearl
from the evening's stem.
Didn't I break all
eighty-eight bones
of my compass, my wingspan
spun from my awkwardness?
This bird returns
to the shell with monstrous
wings, wings clumsy as shovels
in a fist of dirt. It's covered
with ashes, sloughing off
cloud—caught
in my hair, brown
tumor bulged upside
down on the floor
to meet the applause:
this blessing's too
unwieldy. But open
one door, one terrible
 goodbye, hello—the sparrow
flings like a shout for the trees."
101,How We Made a New Art on Old Ground,Eavan Boland,"A famous battle happened in this valley.   
                     You never understood the nature poem.   
Till now. Till this moment—if these statements   
                     seem separate, unrelated, follow this   

silence to its edge and you will hear   
                     the history of air: the crispness of a fern   
or the upward cut and turn around of   
                     a fieldfare or thrush written on it.   

The other history is silent: The estuary   
                     is over there. The issue was decided here:   
Two kings prepared to give no quarter.   
                     Then one king and one dead tradition.   

Now the humid dusk, the old wounds   
                     wait for language, for a different truth:   
When you see the silk of the willow   
                     and the wider edge of the river turn   

and grow dark and then darker, then   
                     you will know that the nature poem   
is not the action nor its end: it is   
                     this rust on the gate beside the trees, on

the cattle grid underneath our feet,   
                     on the steering wheel shaft: it is   
an aftermath, an overlay and even in   
                     its own modest way, an art of peace:

I try the word distance and it fills with   
                     sycamores, a summer's worth of pollen   
And as I write valley straw, metal   
                     blood, oaths, armour are unwritten.   

Silence spreads slowly from these words   
                     to those ilex trees half in, half out   
of shadows falling on the shallow ford   
                     of the south bank beside Yellow Island   

as twilight shows how this sweet corrosion   
                     begins to be complete: what we see   
is what the poem says:   
                     evening coming—cattle, cattle-shadows—

and whin bushes and a change of weather   
                     about to change them all: what we see is how
the place and the torment of the place are   
                     for this moment free of one another."

103,Human Hunger,Mark Halliday,"I

Comstock stands in the densely odorous kitchen 
sniffing Mrs. Yapp’s squab pies. His hunger 
makes him wide awake and he can imagine Mrs. Yapp 
twenty years ago when she was a bouncing Evelina 

and I delight to see them there, Comstock and Mrs. Yapp, 
in the creaking steaming kitchen of darkly scarred wood 
beside the great black doubtless clang of the stove 
being human, in 1836, in the sure conviction 

that the human had better be fed. The pies bubble up— 
apples, bacon, onions, brown sugar and breast of pigeon— 
“A cork’s no good without the bottle, Mrs. Yapp!” 
She grins and kicks his shin and I turn the page.

It’s actually not a very good novel— 
over-invested in local color...
And the same may be said about thee and me, 
in 2036, by the Supreme Kakutani. 

III

Oh, once there was a lad named Marky 
who loved on his bread excessive cheese; 
oh, to write bright comments in a book’s margins was for him quite larky 
and his daughter referred to an elephant when she heard him sneeze. 

Ah, he felt the human mattered keenly, all un-cut and un-dried, 
though to the gods our tumult may seem a paltry flap— 
it was a human, after all, wrote Hardy’s “Hap”...
This Marky lived a while, my braves, a while and then he died! 
Honor the cork of Comstock and the pies of Mrs. Yapp."
104,Humidifier,Louise Glück,"—After Robert Pinsky

Defier of closed space, such as the head, opener 
Of the sealed passageways, so that 
Sunlight entering the nose can once again 

Exit the ear, vaporizer, mist machine, whose 
Soft hiss sounds like another human being 

But less erratic, more stable, or, if not like a human being, 
Carried by one, by my mother to the sick chamber 
Of my childhood — as Freud said, 

Why are you always sick, Louise? his cigar 
Confusing mist with smoke, interfering 
With healing—Embodied 

Summoner of these ghosts, white plastic tub with your elegant 
Clear tub, the water sanitized by boiling, 
Sterile, odorless, 

In my mother’s absence 
Run by me, the one machine 

I understand: what 
Would life be if we could not buy 
Objects to care for us 

And bear them home, away from the druggists’ pity, 
If we could not carry in our own arms 
Alms, alchemy, to the safety of our bedrooms, 
If there were no more 

Sounds in the night, continuous 
Hush, hush of warm steam, not 
Like human breath though regular, if there were nothing in the world 

More hopeful than the self, 
Soothing it, wishing it well."
105,I Am the Woman,William Vaughn Moody,"I am the Woman, ark of the law and its breaker,
Who chastened her steps and taught her knees to be meek,
Bridled and bitted her heart and humbled her cheek,
Parcelled her will, and cried ""Take more!"" to the taker,
Shunned what they told her to shun, sought what they bade her seek,
Locked up her mouth from scornful speaking: now it is open to speak.

I am she that is terribly fashioned, the creature
Wrought in God's perilous mood, in His unsafe hour.
The morning star was mute, beholding my feature,
Seeing the rapture I was, the shame, and the power,
Scared at my manifold meaning; he heard me call
""O fairest among ten thousand, acceptable brother!""
And he answered not, for doubt; till he saw me crawl
And whisper down to the secret worm, ""O mother,
Be not wroth in the ancient house; thy daughter forgets not at all!""
I am the Woman, flëer away,
Soft withdrawer back from the maddened mate,
Lurer inward and down to the gates of day
And crier there in the gate,
""What shall I give for thee, wild one, say!
The long, slow rapture and patient anguish of life,
Or art thou minded a swifter way?
Ask if thou canst, the gold, but oh if thou must,

Good is the shining dross, lovely the dust!
Look at me, I am the Woman, harlot and heavenly wife;
Tell me thy price, be unashamed; I will assuredly pay!""

I am also the Mother: of two that I bore
I comfort and feed the slayer, feed and comfort the slain.
Did they number my daughters and sons? I am mother of more!
Many a head they marked not, here in my bosom has lain,
Babbling with unborn lips in a tongue to be,
Far, incredible matters, all familiar to me.
Still would the man come whispering, ""Wife!"" but many a time my breast
Took him not as a husband: I soothed him and laid him to rest
Even as the babe of my body, and knew him for such.
My mouth is open to speak, that was dumb too much!
I say to you I am the Mother; and under the sword
Which flamed each way to harry us forth from the Lord,
I saw Him young at the portal, weeping and staying the rod,
And I, even I was His mother, and I yearned as the mother of God.

I am also the Spirit. The Sisters laughed
When I sat with them dumb in the portals, over my lamp,
Half asleep in the doors: for my gown was raught
Off at the shoulder to shield from the wind and the rain
The wick I tended against the mysterious hour
When the Silent City of Being should ring with song,
As the Lord came in with Life to the marriage bower.
""Look!"" laughed the elder Sisters; and crimson with shame
I hid my breast away from the rosy flame.
""Ah!"" cried the leaning Sisters, pointing, doing me wrong,
""Do you see?"" laughed the wanton Sisters, ""She will get her lover ere long!""
And it was but a little while till unto my need
He was given indeed,
And we walked where waxing world after world went by;
And I said to my lover, ""Let us begone,
""Oh, let us begone, and try
""Which of them all the fairest to dwell in is,
""Which is the place for us, our desirable clime!""
But he said, ""They are only the huts and the little villages,
Pleasant to go and lodge in rudely over the vintage—time!""
Scornfully spake he, being unwise,
Being flushed at heart because of our walking together.
But I was mute with passionate prophecies;
My heart went veiled and faint in the golden weather,
While universe drifted by after still universe.
Then I cried, ""Alas, we must hasten and lodge therein,
One after one, and in every star that they shed!

A dark and a weary thing is come on our head—
To search obedience out in the bosom of sin,
To listen deep for love when thunders the curse;
For O my love, behold where the Lord hath planted
In every star in the midst His dangerous Tree!
Still I must pluck thereof and bring unto thee,
Saying, ""The coolness for which all night we have panted;
Taste of the goodly thing, I have tasted first!""
Bringing us noway coolness, but burning thirst,
Giving us noway peace, but implacable strife,
Loosing upon us the wounding joy and the wasting sorrow of life!

I am the Woman, ark of the Law and sacred arm to upbear it,
Heathen trumpet to overthrow and idolatrous sword to shear it:
Yea, she whose arm was round the neck of the morning star at song,
Is she who kneeleth now in the dust and cries at the secret door,
""Open to me, 0 sleeping mother! The gate is heavy and strong.
""Open to me, I am come at last; be wroth with thy child no more.
""Let me lie down with thee there in the dark, and be slothful with thee as before!"""
106,I Have Been a Stranger in a Strange Land,Rita Dove,"Life's spell is so exquisite, everything conspires to break it.   Emily Dickinson

It wasn't bliss. What was bliss  
but the ordinary life? She'd spend hours  
in patter, moving through whole days  
touching, sniffing, tasting . . . exquisite  
housekeeping in a charmed world.  
And yet there was always  

more of the same, all that happiness,  
the aimless Being There.  
So she wandered for a while, bush to arbor,  
lingered to look through a pond's restive mirror.  
He was off cataloging the universe, probably,  
pretending he could organize  
what was clearly someone else's chaos.  

That's when she found the tree,  
the dark, crabbed branches  
bearing up such speechless bounty,  
she knew without being told  
this was forbidden. It wasn't  
a question of ownership—  
who could lay claim to  
such maddening perfection?  

And there was no voice in her head,  
no whispered intelligence lurking  
in the leaves—just an ache that grew  
until she knew she'd already lost everything  
except desire, the red heft of it  
warming her outstretched palm."
107,Iceberg Lettuce,Joanie Mackowski,"What vegetable leviathan
extends beneath the dinner table,
an unseen, monstrous green that pulls
the chair out from under our faith
 
in appearances: see a mere tuft
of leaf on the plate like a wing,
but if it flies away, it undoubtedly
will disturb the continental drift
 
asleep under the salad plate,
the hidden world we forget
as we reach for the smaller fork—
(and now, mouth full, don't speak: politely
 
chew your leaf of firmament
that's torn and tossed up in vinegar here as
we'll be tossed before its vast
root maybe someday or any moment)."
108,Immigrant Picnic,Gregory Djanikian,"It's the Fourth of July, the flags
are painting the town,
the plastic forks and knives
are laid out like a parade.

And I'm grilling, I've got my apron,
I've got potato salad, macaroni, relish,
I've got a hat shaped   
like the state of Pennsylvania.

I ask my father what's his pleasure
and he says, ""Hot dog, medium rare,""
and then, ""Hamburger, sure,   
what's the big difference,""   
as if he's really asking.

I put on hamburgers and hot dogs,   
slice up the sour pickles and Bermudas,
uncap the condiments. The paper napkins   
are fluttering away like lost messages.

""You're running around,"" my mother says,   
""like a chicken with its head loose.""

""Ma,"" I say, ""you mean cut off,
loose and cut off   being as far apart   
as, say, son and daughter.""

She gives me a quizzical look as though   
I've been caught in some impropriety.
""I love you and your sister just the same,"" she says,
""Sure,"" my grandmother pipes in,
""you're both our children, so why worry?""

That's not the point I begin telling them,
and I'm comparing words to fish now,   
like the ones in the sea at Port Said,   
or like birds among the date palms by the Nile,
unrepentantly elusive, wild.   

""Sonia,"" my father says to my mother,
""what the hell is he talking about?""
""He's on a ball,"" my mother says.
                                                      
""That's roll!"" I say, throwing up my hands,
""as in hot dog, hamburger, dinner roll....""

""And what about roll out the barrels?"" my mother asks,
and my father claps his hands, ""Why sure,"" he says,
""let's have some fun,"" and launches   
into a polka, twirling my mother   
around and around like the happiest top,   

and my uncle is shaking his head, saying
""You could grow nuts listening to us,""   

and I'm thinking of pistachios in the Sinai
burgeoning without end,   
pecans in the South, the jumbled
flavor of them suddenly in my mouth,
wordless, confusing,
crowding out everything else."
109,Immured,Lily A. Long,"Within this narrow cell that I call ""me"", 
       I was imprisoned ere the worlds began, 
       And all the worlds must run, as first they ran,  
In silver star-dust, ere I shall be free.  
I beat my hands against the walls and find  
It is my breast I beat, O bond and blind!"
110,"Implements from the ""Tomb of the Poet""",A.E. Stallings,"Piraeus Archeological Museum

On the journey to the mundane afterlife, 
You travel equipped to carry on your trade: 
A bronze, small-toothed saw to make repairs, 
The stylus and the ink pot and the scraper, 
Wax tablets bound into a little book. 

Here is the tortoise shell for the cithara, 
Bored through with holes for strings, natural sound box. 
Here is the harp's wood triangle, all empty—
The sheep-gut having long since decomposed 
Into a pure Pythagorean music. 

The beeswax, frangible with centuries, 
Has puzzled all your lyrics into silence. 
I think you were a poet of perfection 
Who fled still weighing one word with another, 
Since wax forgives and warms beneath revision."
111,In Rubble,David Wagoner,"Right after the bomb, even before the ceiling 
   And walls and floor are rearranging 
      You and themselves into a different world, 
You must hold still, must wait for them 
   To settle down in unpredictable ways, 
      To bring their wars, shuddering, 
To an end, and only then should you begin 
   Numbly to feel what freedom may be left 
      To your feet or knees, to your elbows 
Or clenched fingers. Where you used to walk 
   Or lean or lie down or fix your attention 
      At a whim or stomp your foot 
Or slump in a chair, you'll find a new 
   Architecturally unsound floor-plan 
      To contend with, if you can move 
At all. Now you may remember others 
   Who were somewhere near you before 
      This breakdown of circumstances. Caught by surprise 
Like you, they may be waiting separately 
   At their own levels, inside their own portions 
      Of your incoherent flat. They may be thinking 
Of you, as you are of them, and wondering 
   Whether some common passageway, no matter 
      How crooked or narrow, might still exist 
Between you, through which you might share the absence 
   Of food and water and the cold comfort 
      Of daylight. They may be expecting you 
To arrive at any moment, to crawl through dust 
   And fire to their rescue as they find their bodies 
      Growing more stiff, assuming even more 
Unusual attitudes at every turn 
   Of a second hand, at every sound 
      Of a bell or an alarm, at every pounding 
Of a door or a heart, so if you can't reach them 
   Now and they can't reach you, remember, please 
      Remember, whatever you say, 
Whatever you hear or keep to yourself, whatever 
   You scream or whisper, will need to make 
      Some kind of sense, perhaps for days and days."
112,In Time,Gerald Stern,"As far as clocks—and it is time to think of them—
I have one on my kitchen shelf and it is
flat, with a machine-made flair, a perfect
machine from 1948, at the latest,
and made of shining plastic with the numbers
sharp and clear and slightly magnified in
that heartbreaking post-war style, the cord
too short, though what does it matter, since the mechanism
is broken and it sits unplugged alongside a
cheap ceramic rooster, his head insanely
small and yet his tiny brain alert for
he is the one who will crow and not that broken
buzzing relic, though time is different now
and dawn is different too, you were up all night
and it is dark when he crows and you are waiting
to see what direction you should face and if
you were born in time or was it wasted and what
the day looks like and is the rooster loyal."
113,Incubus,Craig Arnold,"The chain uncouples, and his jacket hangs 
on the peg over hers, and he's inside.   

She stalls in the kitchen, putting the kettle on,   
buys herself a minute looking for two   
matching cups for the lime-flower tea,   
not really lime but linden, heart-shaped leaves   
and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze.   
She talks a wall around her, twists the string   
tighter around the tea bag in her spoon.   
But every conversation has to break   
somewhere, and at the far end of the sofa   
he sits, warming his hands around the cup   
he hasn't tasted yet, and listens on   
with such an exasperating show of patience   
it's almost a relief to hear him ask it:   
If you're not using your body right now 
maybe you'd let me borrow it for a while?  

It isn't what you're thinking. No, it's worse.   

Why on earth did she find him so attractive   
the first time she met him, propping the wall   
at an awkward party, clearly trying to drink   
himself into some sort of conversation?   
Was it the dark uncomfortable reserve   
she took upon herself to tease him out of,   
asking, Are you a vampire? That depends,   
he stammered, are you a virgin? No, not funny,   
but why did she laugh at him? What made her think   
that he needed her, that she could teach him something?   
Why did she let him believe she was drunk   
and needed a ride home? Why did she let him   
take her shirt off, fumble around a bit   
on the spare futon, passing back and forth   
the warm breath of a half-hearted kiss   
they kept falling asleep in the middle of?   
And when he asked her, why did she not object?   
I'd like to try something. I need you to trust me.   

Younger and given to daydreams, she imagined   
trading bodies with someone, a best friend,   
the boy she had a crush on. But the fact   
was more fantastic, a fairy-tale adventure   
where the wolf wins, and hides in the girl's red hood.   
How it happens she doesn't really remember,   
drifting off with a vague sense of being   
drawn out through a single point of her skin,   
like a bedsheet threaded through a needle's eye, 
and bundled into a body that must be his.   

Sometimes she startles, as on the verge of sleep   
you can feel yourself fall backward over a brink,   
and snaps her eyelids open, to catch herself   
slipping out of the bed, her legs swinging   
over the edge, and feels the sudden sick   
split-screen impression of being for a second   
both she and her.   
                              What he does with her   
while she's asleep, she never really knows,   
flickers, only, conducted back in dreams:   
Walking in neighborhoods she doesn't know   
and wouldn't go to, overpasses, ragweed,   
cars dry-docked on cinderblocks, wolf-whistles,   
wanting to run away and yet her steps   
planted sure and defiant. Performing tasks   
too odd to recognize and too mundane   
to have made up, like fixing a green salad   
with the sunflower seeds and peppers that she hates,   
pouring on twice the oil and vinegar   
that she would like, and being unable to stop.   
Her hands feel but are somehow not her own,   
running over the racks of stacked fabric   
in a clothing store, stroking the slick silk,   
teased cotton and polar fleece, as if her fingers   
each were a tongue tasting the knits and weaves.   
Harmless enough.   
                              It's what she doesn't dream   
that scares her, panic she can't account for, faces   
familiar but not known, déjà vu   
making a mess of memory, coming to   
with a fresh love-bite on her left breast   
and the aftershock of granting another's flesh,   
of having gripped, slipped in and fluttered tender   
mmm, unbraided, and spent the whole slow day   
clutching her thighs to keep the chafe from fading,   
and furious at being joyful, less   
at the violation, less the danger, than the sense   
he'd taken her enjoyment for his own.   
That was the time before, the time she swore   
would be the last—returning to her senses,   
she'd grabbed his throat and hit him around the face   
and threw him out, and sat there on the floor   
shaking. She hadn't known how hard it was   
to throw a punch without pulling it back.   

Now, as they sit together on her couch   
with the liquid cooling in the stained chipped cups   
that would never match, no matter how hard   
she stared at them, he seems the same as ever,   
a quiet clumsy self-effacing ghost   
with the gray-circled eyes that she once wanted   
so badly to defy, that seemed to see her   
seeing him—and she has to admit, she's missed him.   
Why? She scrolls back through their conversations,   
searching for any reason not to hate him.   
She'd ask him, What's it like being a girl   
when you're not a girl? His answers, when he gave them,   
weren't helpful, so evasively poetic:   
It's like a sponge somebody else is squeezing. 
A radio tuned to all stations at once. 
Like having skin that's softer but more thick.  

Then she remembers the morning she awoke   
with the smear of tears still raw across her cheeks   
and the spent feeling of having cried herself   
down to the bottom of something. Why was I crying?   
she asked, and he looked back blankly, with that little   
curve of a lip that served him for a smile.   
Because I can't.  
                              And that would be their secret.   
The power to feel another appetite   
pass through her, like a shudder, like a cold   
lungful of oxygen or hot sweet smoke,   
fill her and then be stilled. The freedom to fall   
asleep behind the blinds of his dark body   
and wake cleanly. And when she swings her legs   
over the edge of the bed, to trust her feet   
to hit the carpet, and know as not before   
how she never quite trusted the floor   
to be there, no, not since she was a girl   
first learning to swim, hugging her skinny   
breastless body close to the pool-gutter,   
skirting along the dark and darker blue   
of the bottom dropping out— 
                              Now she can stand,   
and take the cup out of his giving hand,   
and feel what they have learned inside each other   
fair and enough, and not without a kind   
of satisfaction, that she can put her foot   
down, clear to the bottom of desire,   
and find that it can stop, and go no deeper."
114,Indiscriminate Kisses,Nance Van Winckel,"Foreplay of obscene graffiti carved  
into trees—foot-long boners  
gouge the bark. Beaks and snouts  
on a restroom mirror. Slick lips.  
Succulent lips. I go out among them  
sometimes. So sweet how they pucker up  
out of pity. A practiced pathos  
in a saloon of woodsmen whose axes  
wait in trucks out back. Lips full of yawn  

or yes. Lips thick with God-spit  
and God-suck. Chapped lips, bloody lips.  
Pierced or tattooed, they pout 
into view—here to give, willy-nilly, 
what's been too long held in the body. 
Something passes across tongues. It sayeth not  
a name; it taketh everyone's turn. Mute lips  
of a swift unbuttoner. Mouths fording  
frothy streams, vaporous bogs.  
I stumble forth in their midst. Maybe  
I am out of bread or in a bad place  
with a book. The streets have an attendant 
caress. Moon lapping rumor. Fat lip  
approaches hare lip. There go pasty 
lips. All are readied as if for a race  
or to be plucked like rare moths  
by bright wings from the air. Betty's lips  
and Bobby's and Bucky's just before the collision 
and the siren's red wail. Laddy, keep 

a light on. I may have to come ashore 
some distance from where I set in."
115,[IT'S BEEN TWO THOUSAND YEARS NOW],Marie-Claire Bancquart,"It's been two thousand years now that, with a wounded leg,  
the god's amazing loves have dragged along.  

He has aged. Soon  
he won't be noticed except from way up in a plane  
in the markings of wheat  
that yield the trace  
of an ancient sanctuary.  

He solicits a language of caresses,  
open pasture, available bodies,  

and the words refuse, and this elsewhere is already in his death  
except for a slender purple flower under the sun.  

He can still act the god all around,  
evening's worn heart.  

He guesses the flower will slip  
fragile  
from one century to the next with its prayer."
116,The Jester,Margaret Widdemer,"I have known great gold Sorrows:  
Majestic Griefs shall serve me watchfully  
Through the slow-pacing morrows:  
I have knelt hopeless where sea-echoing  
Dim endless voices cried of suffering  
Vibrant and far in broken litany:  
Where white magnolia and tuberose hauntingly  
Pulsed their regretful sweets along the air-— 
All things most tragical, most fair,  
Have still encompassed me . . .  

I dance where in the screaming market-place  
The dusty world that watches buys and sells,  
With painted merriment upon my face,  
Whirling my bells,  
Thrusting my sad soul to its mockery. 

I have known great gold Sorrows . . .  
Shall they not mock me, these pain-haunted ones,  
If it shall make them merry, and forget  
That grief shall rise and set  
With the unchanging, unforgetting suns  
Of their relentless morrows?"
117,Just Another Paradigm Shift,Paul Grant,"Just a shadow. Hardly that. But audible. 
Coming out of the woods, whispering 
Happily Ever After. 
                          Even in that light— 
stars with the skeletons of animals 
and old friends— 
                       visible 
to the eye behind the one always 
left open on the east side of the house, 
downhill. Where the coffee trees 
and hemp and the graves of old dogs lie, 
buried themselves in leaves and left 
to the sputtering wind of memory. 

& if that's not enough (he says 
to himself in the voice of a black-and-white 
actor whose name is a moth that keeps 
avoiding the tip of his flaming tongue) 
to bring you home, well, there 
it is again, 
              already exhausted 
by your efforts to make it 
comfortable 
enough to stay. Impatient, 
                                   already headed 
back down into the woods, whispering 
Once Upon A Time . . ."
118,Kind of Blue,Lynn Powell,"Not Delft or
delphinium, not Wedgewood
among the knickknacks, not wide-eyed chicory
evangelizing in the devil strip—

              But way on down in the moonless
              octave below midnight, honey,
              way down where you can't tell cerulean from teal.

Not Mason jars of moonshine, not
waverings of silk, not the long-legged hunger
of a heron or the peacock's
iridescent id—

              But Delilahs of darkness, darling,
              and the muscle of the mind
              giving in.

Not sullen snow slumped
against the garden, not the first instinct of flame,
not small, stoic ponds, or the cold derangement
of a jealous sea—

              But bluer than the lips of Lazarus, baby,
              before Sweet Jesus himself could figure out
              what else in the world to do but weep."
119,Kindness,Yusef Komunyakaa,"For Carol Rigolot

  
        When deeds splay before us 
precious as gold & unused chances
stripped from the whine-bone,
we know the moment kindheartedness
walks in. Each praise be
echoes us back as the years uncount
themselves, eating salt. Though blood
first shaped us on the climbing wheel,
the human mind lit by the savanna’s
ice star & thistle rose,
your knowing gaze enters a room
& opens the day,
saying we were made for fun.
Even the bedazzled brute knows
when sunlight falls through leaves
across honed knives on the table.
If we can see it push shadows
aside, growing closer, are we less
broken? A barometer, temperature
gauge, a ruler in minus fractions
& pedigrees, a thingmajig,
a probe with an all-seeing eye,
what do we need to measure
kindness, every unheld breath,
every unkind leapyear?
Sometimes a sober voice is enough
to calm the waters & drive away
the false witnesses, saying, Look,
here are the broken treaties Beauty
brought to us earthbound sentinels."

121,The Lake,Sophie Cabot Black,"Day and night, the lake dreams of sky.
A privacy as old as the mountains
And her up there, stuck among peaks. The whole eye

Fastened on hawk, gatherings of cloud or stars,
So little trespass. An airplane once
Crossed her brow; she searched but could not find

A face. Having lived with such strict beauty
She comes to know how the sun is nothing
But itself and the path it throws; the moon

A riddled stone. If only a hand
Would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. Even the elk
Pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below—

How she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves
Her, as it sings all the way down the mountain."
122,Layabout,John Brehm,"Do nothing and everything will be done,   
that's what Mr. Lao Tzu said, who walked   
around talking 2,500 years ago and   

now his books practically grow on trees   
they're so popular and if he were   
alive today beautiful women would 

rush up to him like waves lapping   
at the shores of his wisdom.   
That's the way it is, I guess: humbling. 

But if I could just unclench my fists,   
empty out my eyes, turn my mind into   
a prayer flag for the wind to play with, 

we could be brothers, him the older one   
who's seen and not done it all and me   
still unlearning, both of us slung low 

in our hammocks, our hats tipped   
forwards, hands folded neatly,   
like bamboo huts, above our hearts."
123,[Les plantes et les planètes],Robert Marteau,"Les plantes et les planètes
Au même ciel obáissent ;
Du même soleil les bêtes
Et les hommes se nourrissent ;

Et le mátal dans la mine
Couve l'astre minuscule,
Soufre dont la fleur si fine
Vit en chaque corpuscule.

Naines ou gáantes sont
Poudre et bran jetás loin
Qui sans chute ou frein s'en vont
Aux quatre mondes sans coin

Ni angle, d'anges peuplás,
Mais d'autres disent que non,
Dont les mondes envolás

[Plants and planets] 

Plants and planets
Obey the same heaven;
As beasts and men
Are nourished by the same sun;

And the metal in the mine
Warms minute stars,
Sulphurous flowers so delicate
They live in every corpuscule.

Dwarves and giants are
Powder and dust thrown far
Without fall or check whirl
To the four cornerless, angleless

Worlds, peopled with angels,
But others say not at all.
Their worlds seem
Fired from a cannon,

Fired by whom by chance,
This expanding consequence,
The fruit of some grapeshot
Without any intelligence."
124,Letter of Recommendation,Robert B. Shaw,"Miss A, who graduated six years back,
has air-expressed me an imposing stack
of forms in furtherance of her heart's desire:
a Ph.D. Not wishing to deny her,
I dredge around for something laudatory
to say that won't be simply a tall story;
in fact, I search for memories of her,
and draw a blank—or say, at best a blur.
Was hers the class in that ungodly room
whose creaking door slammed with a sonic boom,
whose radiators twangled for the first
ten minutes, and then hissed, and (this was worst)
subsided with a long, regretful sigh?
Yes, there, as every Wednesday we would try
to overlook cacophony and bring
our wits to bear on some distinguished thing
some poet sometime wrote, Miss A would sit
calm in a middle row and ponder it.
Blonde, I believe, and quiet (so many are).
A dutiful note-taker. Not a star.
Roundheads and Cavaliers received their due
notice from her before the term was through.
She wrote a paper on . . . could it have been
""Milton's Idea of Original Sin""?
Or was it ""Deathbed Imagery in Donne""?
Whichever, it was likely not much fun
for her. It wasn't bad, though I've seen better.
But I can hardly say that in a letter
like this one, now refusing to take shape
even as wispy memories escape
the reach of certitude. Try as I may,
I cannot render palpable Miss A,
who, with five hundred classmates, left few traces
when she decamped. Those mortarboard-crowned faces,
multitudes, beaming, ardent to improve
a world advancing dumbly in its groove,
crossing the stage that day—to be consigned
to a cold-storage portion of the mind . . .
What could be sadder? (She remembered me.)
The transcript says I gave Miss A a B."
125,Li Hua's Messenger,Peter Bethanis,"In a hut far from the village  
Li Hua bends over his canvas  
like an insect.  

He is so deliberate,  
each stroke is a spider's legs  
fighting the current.  

There is a war in his veins,  
a battle of desires.  
He is jealous of Li Po  
whose pictures glide  
like the moon over dark water.  

I do not wish  
to disturb him  
as he tries to make art  
in this time of death,  

so I will wait,  
like a fly on the tip of a stick,  
until he is finished."
126,Lions Are Interesting,Joel Brouwer,"Each morning in the little white cabin  
by the river they woke to a raccoon  
clawing under the floorboards or banging  
in the wood stove. They did not discuss this.  
Instead they said it was a perfect day  
to pick blueberries on the hill, or that  
a hike to the old glassworks sounded good.  
They were beginning to speak not in meat  
but in the brown paper the butcher wraps  
around it. Brown paper around dirty  
magazines. Like dirty magazines, they  
only traced the contour of substance: silk  
over skin, skin over muscle, muscle over  
bone. What's under bone? Marrow? Their forks so  
small and dull. As if for dolls. You can tell  
dolls from animals because the latter  
are made of meat. Many eat it, also.  
Lions are interesting. Lions don't eat  
the flesh of their kills right away, but first  
lap up the blood, until the meat is blanched  
nearly white. White as the little cabin  
by the river they stayed in that summer.  
White as the raccoon covered in ashes,  
his black eyes bottomless and bright with hate."
127,LITTLE BLESSING FOR MY FLOATER,Jeanne Murray Walker,"After George Herbert

This tiny ruin in my eye, small
flaw in the fabric, little speck
of blood in the egg, deep chip
in the windshield, north star,
polestar, floater that doesn't
float, spot where my hand is not,
even when I'm looking at my hand,
little piton that nails every rock
I see, no matter if the picture
turns to sand, or sand to sea,
I embrace you, piece of absence
that reminds me what I will be,
all dark some day unless God
rescues me, oh speck
that might teach me yet to see."
128,Little God Origami,Stefi Weisburd,"The number of corners in the soul can't
compare with the universe's dimensions folded
neatly into swans. In the soul's
space, one word on a thousand pieces
of paper the size of cookie fortunes falls
from the heavens. At last, the oracular
answer, you cry, pawing at the scraps that twirl
like seed-pod helicopters. Alas, the window
to your soul needs a good scrubbing, so
the letters doodle into indecipherables just
like every answer that has rained
down through history, and you realize, in
your little smog of thought that death
will simply be the cessation of asking, a thousand
cranes unfolding themselves and returning to the trees."
129,Love Poem for an Enemy,Richard Katrovas,"I, as sinned against as sinning, 
take small pleasure from the winning 
of our decades-long guerrilla war. 
For from my job I've wanted more 
than victory over one who'd tried 
to punish me before he died, 
and now, neither of us dead, 
we haunt these halls in constant dread 
of drifting past the other's life 
while long-term memory is rife 
with slights that sting like paper cuts. 
We've occupied our separate ruts 
yet simmered in a single rage. 
We've grown absurd in middle age 
together, and should seek wisdom now 
together, by ending this row. 
I therefore decommission you 
as constant flagship of my rue. 
Below the threshold of my hate 
you now my good regard may rate. 
For I have let my anger pass. 
But, while you're down there, kiss my ass."
130,Love Recidivus,Lisa Barnett,"Whatever it may be, we may suppose 
it is not love, for love must leave its trace 
like contraband seized and displayed in rows; 
is not sufficient reason to erase 

the careful lives we have so far lived through— 
there is no call for us to undermine 
the walls we've built; no need to think anew 
of all the chains and choices that define 

us still. And yet for all our fine intent 
a single touch ignites the night and tries 
resolve past all resisting. What we meant 
before we mean again; fidelities 

have yet been known to shift and come undone 
and all good reasons fail us, one by one."
131,Luciferin,Dean Young,"""They won't attack us here in the Indian graveyard."" 
I love that moment. And I love the moment 
when I climb into your warm you-smelling 
bed-dent after you've risen. And sunflowers, 
once a whole field and I almost crashed, 
the next year all pumpkins! Crop rotation, 
I love you. Dividing words between syl- 
lables! Dachshunds! What am I but the inter- 
section of these loves? I spend 35 dollars on a CD 
of some guy with 15 different guitars in his shack 
with lots of tape delays and loops, a good buy! 
Mexican animal crackers! But only to be identified 
by what you love is a malformation just as 
embryonic chickens grow very strange in zero 
gravity. I hate those experiments on animals, 
varnished bats, blinded rabbits, cows 
with windows in their flanks but obviously 
I'm fascinated. Perhaps it was my early exposure 
to Frankenstein. I love Frankenstein! Arrgh, 
he replies to everything, fire particularly 
sets him off, something the villagers quickly 
pick up. Fucking villagers. All their shouting's 
making conversation impossible and now 
there's grit in my lettuce which I hate 
but kinda like in clams as one bespeaks 
poor hygiene and the other the sea. 
I hate what we're doing to the sea, 
dragging huge chains across the bottom, 
bleaching reefs. Either you're a rubber/ 
gasoline salesman or like me, you'd like 
to duct tape the vice president's mouth 
to the exhaust pipe of an SUV and I hate 
feeling like that. I would rather concentrate 
on the rapidity of your ideograms, how 
only a biochemical or two keeps me 
from becoming the world's biggest lightning bug."
132,Lullaby for the Second Millennium,J. Allyn Rosser,"From the point of view of all time, 
these recent changes signal 
more a return to nature 
than a departure, than degradation. 
In the beginning, after all, 
there was boiling rock. 
Then waters arranging their bodies 
around an era of softer forms: 
lichen, grassland, swaying treetops. 
Then creatures, movingly fleshed, 
treading pathways that hardened. 
Then pavement hardening 
and cities, monumental. 
Soon mostly rock again, 
and radiant. More and more like moon. 
Soon, sooner than is being thought, 
there will be even more light. 
The creatures will have stopped 
being able to move 
or be moved. 
And the rock will boil."
133,Magnificat,Eleanor Wilner,"When he had suckled there, he began   
to grow: first, he was an infant in her arms,   
but soon, drinking and drinking at the sweet   
milk she could not keep from filling her,   
from pouring into his ravenous mouth,   
and filling again, miraculous pitcher, mercy   
feeding its own extinction . . . soon he was   
huge, towering above her, the landscape,   
his shadow stealing the color from the fields,   
even the flowers going gray. And they came   
like ants, one behind the next, to worship   
him—huge as he was, and hungry; it was   
his hunger they admired most of all.   
So they brought him slaughtered beasts:   
goats, oxen, bulls, and finally, their own   
kin whose hunger was a kind of shame   
to them, a shrinkage; even as his was   
beautiful to them, magnified, magnificent.   
   
The day came when they had nothing left   
to offer him, having denuded themselves   
of all in order to enlarge him, in whose   
shadow they dreamed of light: and that   
is when the thought began to move, small   
at first, a whisper, then a buzz, and finally,   
it broke out into words, so loud they thought   
it must be prophecy: they would kill him,   
and all they had lost in his name would return,   
renewed and fresh with the dew of morning.   
Hope fed their rage, sharpened their weapons.   
   
And who is she, hooded figure, mourner now   
at the fate of what she fed? And the slow rain,   
which never ends, who is the father of that?   
And who are we who speak, as if the world   
were our diorama—its little figures moved   
by hidden gears, precious in miniature, tin soldiers,   
spears the size of pins, perfect replicas, history   
under glass, dusty, old fashioned, a curiosity   
that no one any longer wants to see,   
excited as they are by the new giant, who feeds   
on air, grows daily on radio waves, in cyberspace,   
who sows darkness like a desert storm,   
who blows like a wind through the Boardrooms,
 who touches the hills, and they smoke."

135,Mapping the Genome,Michael Symmons Roberts,"Geneticist as driver, down the gene
codes in, let's say, a topless coupe
and you keep expecting bends,

real tyre-testers on tight
mountain passes, but instead it's dead
straight, highway as runway,

helix unravelled as vista,
as vanishing point. Keep your foot
down. This is a finite desert.

You move too fast to read it,
the order of the rocks, the cacti,
roadside weeds, a blur to you.

Every hour or so, you pass a shack
which passes for a motel here:
tidy faded rooms with TVs on

for company, the owner pacing out
his empty parking lot. And after
each motel you hit a sandstorm

thick as fog, but agony.
Somewhere out there are remnants
of our evolution, genes for how

to fly south, sense a storm,
hunt at night, how to harden
your flesh into hide or scales.

These are the miles of dead code.
Every desert has them.
You are on a mission to discover

why the human heart still slows
when divers break the surface,
why mermaids still swim in our dreams."

137,Mary Shelley in Brigantine,Stephen Dunn,"Because the ostracized experience the world 
in ways peculiar to themselves, often seeing it 
clearly yet with such anger and longing 
that they sometimes enlarge what they see, 
she at first saw Brigantine as a paradise for gulls. 
She must be a horseshoe crab washed ashore. 

How startling, though, no one knew about her past, 
the scandal with Percy, the tragic early deaths, 
yet sad that her Frankenstein had become 
just a name, like Dracula or Satan, something 
that stood for a kind of scariness, good for a laugh. 
She found herself welcome everywhere. 

People would tell her about Brigantine Castle, 
turned into a house of horror. They thought 
she'd be pleased that her monster roamed 
its dark corridors, making children scream. 
They lamented the day it was razed. 
Thus Mary Shelley found herself accepted 

by those who had no monster in them —
the most frightening people alive, she thought. 
Didn't they know Frankenstein had abandoned 
his creation, set him loose without guidance 
or a name? Didn't they know what it feels like 
to be lost, freaky, forever seeking who you are? 

She was amazed now that people believed 
you could shop for everything you might need. 
She loved that in the dunes you could almost hide. 
At the computer store she asked an expert 
if there was such a thing as too much knowledge, 
or going too far? He directed her to a website 

where he thought the answers were. 
Yet Mary Shelley realized that the pain she felt 
all her life was gone. Could her children, dead so young, 
be alive somewhere, too? She couldn't know 
that only her famous mother had such a chance. 
She was almost ready to praise this awful world."
138,Memorial Service,George Garrett,"Forgiving the living is hard 
enough, shrugging away all the wounds 
delivered with kisses and curses, 
the thousand and one petty slights 
that bled me to an albino shade, 
that shadow me even in dreams. 

But the dead are altogether 
another matter, not easily to be 
enlightened and quite beyond regretting 
anything (as far as we can tell) 
and most likely indifferent to 
our common currency of tears. 

And so it is that pissing on your grave 
doesn't please me as much as it ought to. 
Now that you have passed beyond 
all blaming and shaming, what can I do 
but rise and proclaim sincere admiration 
when my turn comes around to speak?"
139,Middle-Aged: A Study in an Emotion,Ezra Pound,"A STUDY IN AN EMOTION

""'Tis but a vague, invarious delight. 
As gold that rains about some buried king. 

As the fine flakes, 
When tourists frolicking 
Stamp on his roof or in the glazing light 
Try photographs, wolf down their ale and cakes 
And start to inspect some further pyramid; 

As the fine dust, in the hid cell beneath 
Their transitory step and merriment, 
Drifts through the air, and the sarcophagus 
Gains yet another crust 
Of useless riches for the occupant, 
So I, the fires that lit once dreams 
Now over and spent, 
Lie dead within four walls 
And so now love 
Rains down and so enriches some stiff case, 
And strews a mind with precious metaphors, 

And so the space 
Of my still consciousness 
Is full of gilded snow, 

The which, no cat has eyes enough 
To see the brightness of."""
140,Military Mind,Charlie Smith,"I wanted to go to military school  
and march, I wanted to grow up  
and be composed and expert  
with a rifle, with tactics and fighting,  
to be safe and courageous among men  
in barracks and on the battlefield.  
I wanted to see my arms hairy and  
corded with muscle at the end of rolled up khaki sleeves.  
I wanted to flex my feet in boots and  
look down at the the dust of battles  
dimming the leather surfaces, the blood slick  
on the rim of the soles. I wanted  
the smell of gunpowder in my nostrils, the grime  
on my face, the washed-out hollow  
love for my comrades found in the foxholes,  
the sad understanding, the requiems  
of late afternoons walking away from the burial site  
with the widow as she cradled the triangulated flag  
like a plowblade in her arms."

endangered species numbered individually

women to hold them babies babies everywhere

quintuplets she was suckling them in shifts 
a mountain of sheets universally admired  
a goddess of fertility her smile  
could persuade the skies to rain Her litter  
slept ointment-eyed in pink wool caps while Dad 
ran his hand through his hair thinking maybe  
of money as he stood surveying his 
crowded living room his wealth of heartbeats

the bottlecap was Sorry—Try Again 
you set it down and did not speak of it 
the moon flanked by her brood of stars that night 
a chaste distracted kiss goodnight that night 
your body quiet having spilled its secret 
your palms flat on your belly holding holding 

Forgive me if I had no words that night 
but I was wondering in the silence still 
begetting silence whether to console you 
if I consoled you it would make the loss 
your loss and so we laid beside ourselves 
a while because I had no words until

around hope like a book preserving petals 
a book we did not open till the morning when 
we found hope dry and brittle but intact"

It begins with unspecified “you” and “we”  
raising fists of defiance to the void, 
the morning we opened the obituary, 
a pun on “decompose” you’d have enjoyed. 
These crocodile tears shed in rhyme, 
in an age too commercial to care, 
recall how we met the first time 
and the feisty old trooper you were, 
        you were, 
what a feisty old trooper you were: 

the snook you cocked at convention; 
writing only when the muse was near 
your solitary published collection, 
Parnassus—A Calling Not a Career, 
we reviewed and/or said we admired: 
its allusions to myth, its classical power 
we found “inspiring” if not “inspired”  
and “important” as a euphemism for  “dour,”  
        for “dour,”  
important to find euphemisms for “dour”; 

your committee work; your taste in shoes; 
your alcoholism and/or love for jazz; 
your appetite for social issues 
that none of the young crowd has; 
your impatience with those smart alecks 
who expect to have and eat their cake, 
and some daringly inverted syntax 
the occasional end-rhyme to make, 
        to make, 
occasionally an end-rhyme you’d make; 

your insistence upon a thing called “craft”  
(perhaps you meant margarine); 
how establishment critics originally laughed 
at your pamphlets from the Slovene; 
how you very nearly popped your clogs 
as we fought to get your name cleared; 
you were our stag set upon by dogs,  
indestructible in duffel coat and/or beard, 
        your beard, 
the indescribable duffel coat and/or beard; 

your years of silence and/or  second wife 
whose whereabouts remain uncertain; 
a paean to your flowering late in life 
in some council flat in Suburbiton 
and your dab hand with a hoover 
seasoned with the odd gratuitous clue 
(much as we champion your oeuvre) 
that we’re better writers than you, 
        than you, 
we’re better writers than you; 

the valedictions when last we met—  
“Shut the door, comrades, adieu”—  
however innocuous when said, 
now seem prophetic: you knew; 
your despair and/or  your courage; 
a warning for our planet and times 
culminating with a rhetorical flourish 
that pans out along these lines, 
        these lines, 
that pads out along these lines: 

Something something something world, 
something something something grope. 
Something something something unfurled, 
something something something hope. 

Something something something dark, 
something something something night. 
Something something something lark, 
something something something light."

Saying to me as we walked across the Yard 
Cold brittle autumn is you should be wearing overcoat. I said 
You are not wearing overcoat. He said, 
You should do as I say not do as I do. 
Just how American it was and how late Forties it was 
Delmore, but not I, was probably aware. He quoted Finnegans Wake to me 
In his New York apartment sitting on chair 
Table directly in front of him. There did he write? I am wondering. 
Look at this photograph said of his mother and father. 
Coney Island. Do they look happy? He couldn't figure it out. 
Believed Pogo to be at the limits of our culture. 
Pogo. Walt Kelly must have read Joyce Delmore said. 
Why don't you ask him? 
Why don't you ask Walt Kelly if he read Finnegans Wake or not. 
Your parents don't look happy but it is just a photograph. 
Maybe they felt awkward posing for photographs. 
Maybe it is just a bad photograph. Delmore is not listening 
I want to hear him tell me something sad but however true. 
Delmore in his tomb is sitting. People say yes everyone is dying 
But here read this happy book on the subject. Not Delmore. Not that rueful man."
145,The Months,Linda Pastan,"January

Contorted by wind,
mere armatures for ice or snow,
the trees resolve
to endure for now,

they will leaf out in April.
And I must be as patient
as the trees—
a winter resolution

I break all over again,
as the cold presses
its sharp blade
against my throat.

 February

After endless
hibernation
on the windowsill,
the orchid blooms—

embroidered purple stitches
up and down
a slender stem.
Outside, snow

melts midair
to rain.
Abbreviated month.
Every kind of weather.

 March

When the Earl King came
to steal away the child
in Goethe’s poem, the father said
don’t be afraid,

it’s just the wind. . .
As if it weren’t the wind
that blows away the tender
fragments of this world—

leftover leaves in the corners
of the garden, a Lenten Rose
that thought it safe
to bloom so early.

 April

In the pastel blur
of the garden,
the cherry
and redbud

shake rain
from their delicate
shoulders, as petals
of pink

dogwood
wash down the ditches
in dreamlike
rivers of color.

 May

May apple, daffodil,
hyacinth, lily,
and by the front
porch steps

every billowing
shade of purple
and lavender lilac,
my mother’s favorite flower,

sweet breath drifting through
the open windows:
perfume of memory—conduit
of spring.

 June

The June bug
on the screen door
whirs like a small,
ugly machine,

and a chorus of frogs
and crickets drones like Musak
at all the windows.
What we don’t quite see

comforts us.
Blink of lightning, grumble
of thunder—just the heat
clearing its throat.

 July

Tonight the fireflies
light their brief
candles
in all the trees

of summer—
color of moonflakes,
color of fluorescent
lace

where the ocean drags
its torn hem
over the dark
sand.

 August

Barefoot
and sun-dazed,
I bite into this ripe peach
of a month,

gathering children
into my arms
in all their sandy
glory,

heaping
my table each night
with nothing
but corn and tomatoes.

 September

Their summer romance
over, the lovers
still cling
to each other

the way the green
leaves cling
to their trees
in the strange heat

of September, as if
this time
there will be
no autumn.

 October

How suddenly
the woods
have turned
again. I feel

like Daphne, standing
with my arms
outstretched
to the season,

overtaken
by color, crowned
with the hammered gold
of leaves.

 November 

These anonymous
leaves, their wet
bodies pressed
against the window

or falling past—
I count them
in my sleep,
absolving gravity,

absolving even death
who knows as I do
the imperatives
of the season.

 December

The white dove of winter
sheds its first
fine feathers;
they melt

as they touch
the warm ground
like notes
of a once familiar

music; the earth
shivers and
turns towards
the solstice."
146,Music,George Scarbrough,"Han-Shan sits on a flat stone 
In his garden and plays the flute, 
Mimicking the birds singing among 
The gourd vines or from the top 
Of the blue pine tree. 

Or he constructs a new trellis 
For the rambling rose over his front 
Gate or works at the great loom in his porch, 
Weaving his own coverlets. 

Sometimes, he paints drinking gourds 
To hang at his cold spring. 

His poems, delicate but strong, 
Paper the ceiling above his bed, 
So he can lie and read 
His own masterpieces. 

No man, he avers, can catch 
Such fish in one basket."
147,"My Brother the Artist, at Seven",Philip Levine,"As a boy he played alone in the fields   
behind our block, six frame houses   
holding six immigrant families,   
the parents speaking only gibberish   
to their neighbors. Without the kids   
they couldn't say ""Good morning"" and be   
understood. Little wonder   
he learned early to speak to himself,   
to tell no one what truly mattered.   
How much can matter to a kid   
of seven? Everything. The whole world   
can be his. Just after dawn he sneaks   
out to hide in the wild, bleached grasses   
of August and pretends he's grown up,   
someone complete in himself without   
the need for anyone, a warrior   
from the ancient places our fathers   
fled years before, those magic places:   
Kiev, Odessa, the Crimea,   
Port Said, Alexandria, Lisbon,   
the Canaries, Caracas, Galveston.   
In the damp grass he recites the names   
over and over in a hushed voice   
while the sun climbs into the locust tree   
to waken the houses. The husbands leave   
for work, the women return to bed, the kids   
bend to porridge and milk. He advances   
slowly, eyes fixed, an animal or a god,   
while beneath him the earth holds its breath."
148,My Century,Alan Feldman,"The year I was born the atomic bomb went off. 
Here I'd just begun, and someone 
found the switch to turn off the world. 

In the furnace-light, in the central solar fire 
of that heat lamp, the future got very finite, 
and it was possible to imagine time-travelers 

failing to arrive, because there was no future. 
Inside the great dark clock in the hall, 
heavy brass cylinders descended. 

Tick-tock, the chimes changed their tune 
one phrase at a time. The bomb became 
a film star, its glamorous globe of smoke 

searing the faces of men in beach chairs. 
Someone threw up every day at school. 
No time to worry about collective death, 

when life itself was permeated by ordeals. 
And so we grew up, beneath an umbrella of acceptance. 
In bio we learned there were particles 

cruising through us like whales through archipelagoes, 
and in civics that if Hitler had gotten the bomb 
he'd have used it on the inferior races, 

and all this time love was etching its scars 
on our skins like maps. The heavens 
remained pure, except for little white slits 

on the perfect blue skin that planes cut 
in the icy upper air, like needles sewing. 
From one, a tiny seed might fall 

that would make a sun on earth. 
And so the century passed, with me still in it, 
books waiting on the shelves to become cinders, 

what we felt locked up inside, waiting to be read, 
down the long corridor of time. I was born 
the year the bomb exploded. Twice 

whole cities were charred like cities in the Bible, 
but we didn't look back. We went on thinking 
we could go on, our shapes the same, 

darkened now against a background lit by fire. 
Forgive me for doubting you're there, 
Citizens, on your holodecks with earth wallpaper—

a shadow-toned ancestor with poorly pressed pants, 
protected like a child from knowing the future."
149,My Dog Practices Geometry,Cathryn Essinger,"I do not understand the poets who tell me 
that I should not personify. Every morning 
the willow auditions for a new role 

outside my bedroom window—today she is 
Clytemnestra; yesterday a Southern Belle, 
lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts. 

Nor do I like the mathematicians who tell me 
I cannot say, ""The zinnias are counting on their 
fingers,"" or ""The dog is practicing her geometry,"" 

even though every day I watch her using 
the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle 
from which she bisects the circumference 

of the lawn until she finds the place where 
the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped 
the ante by climbing into a new Euclidian plane. 

She stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling 
her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working 
the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention, 

her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping, 
yes, even over themselves, until I go out to assist, 
by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, ""There! 

There!"" But instead of following my outstretched 
arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is 
now lounging under a canopy of leaves, 

catching its breath, charting its next escape, 
she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips, 
confident that I—who can bring her home 

from across the field with a word, who 
can speak for the willow and the zinnia— 
can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree."
150,My God,Susan Rolston,"Protestants pray for grace, 
Scientists look to space. 
Jews find truth in the Torah, 
New Agers, in each other's aura. 

Catholics are blessed by a Pope, 
Yaquis enlightened by dope. 
Maoris use ritual chants, 
Navahos get up and dance. 

Muslims bow daily to Allah, 
Norsemen aspire to Valhalla. 
Feminists swear by a She, 
Quakers swear not, silently. 

Confucians kowtow to ancestors, 
Hare Krishnas, to airport investors. 
Hindus revere Lord Brahma, 
Richard Gere, the Dalai Lama. 

Baptists believe in the Ark, 
Physicists, in the quark. 
Moonies obey Reverend Sun, 
Mormons say Brigham's the one. 

Daoists extol yang and yin, 
Sufis transcend in a spin. 
Shintos seek peace where it's grassy, 
Rastas, in Haile Selassie. 

When we meet in the Afterlife, 
We can laugh at sectarian strife. 
But meanwhile back to the wars, 
'Cause my God's better than yours."
151,N,Randall Mann,"has crawled out of the ocean  
to carry us from sleep, like sleep,  

the gray of outer Sunset portending  
the gray of inner Sunset. And so on.  

On the N, one should invent  
intricate fictions for the lives  

of the passengers: time is a game.  
Soon we will be underground.  

But first, the long lush green  
of Duboce Park, the happiness of dogs!  

Good-bye now to their owners  
eyeing one another. Good-bye  

to the park's locked men's room,  
where once a man was found dead,  

his penis shoved into his own mouth.  
The world continues, the engine  

of the world the letter N."

153,Nightwatchman's Song,W. D. Snodgrass,"After Heinrich I. F. Biber

I 

What’s unseen may not exist—   
Or so those secret powers insist   
            That prowl past nightfall,   
Enabled by the brain’s blacklist   
            To fester out of sight,   

So we streak from bad to worse,   
Through an expanding universe   
            And see no evil.   
On my rounds like a night nurse   
            Or sentry on qui vive,   

I make, through murkier hours, my way   
Where the sun patrolled all day   
            Toward stone-blind midnight   
To poke this flickering flashlamp’s ray   
            At what’s hushed up and hidden.   

Lacking all leave or protocol,   
Things, one by one, hear my footfall,   
            Blank out their faces,   
Dodge between trees, find cracks in walls   
            Or lock down offices.   

Still, though scuttling forces flee   
Just as far stars recede from me   
            To outmost boundaries,   
I stalk through ruins and debris,   
            Graveyard and underground.   

Led by their helmetlantern’s light   
Miners inch through anthracite;   
            I’m the unblinking mole   
That sniffs out what gets lost or might   
            Slip down the world’s black hole.   

II 

(ending his rounds, the watchman, somewhat tipsy, returns) 

What’s obscene?—just our obsessed,   
Incessant itch and interest   
      In things found frightful:   
In bestial tortures, rape, incest;   
      In ripe forbidden fruit   

Dangling, lush, just out of reach;   
Dim cellars nailed up under each   
      Towering success,   
The loser’s envy that will teach   
      A fierce vindictiveness,   

The victors’ high court that insures   
Pardon for winners and procures   
      Little that’s needed   
But all we lust for. What endures?—   
      Exponential greed   

And trash containers overflowing   
With shredded memos, records showing   
      What, who, when, why   
’Til there’s no sure way of knowing   
      What’s clear to every eye:   

The heart’s delight in hatred, runny   
As the gold drip from combs of honey;   
      The rectal intercourse   
Of power politics and money   
      That slimes both goal and source.   

What’s obscured?—what’s abscessed.   
After inspection, I’d suggest   
      It’s time we got our head   
Rewired. I plan to just get pissed,   
      Shitfaced and brain-dead."
154,Nimis Compos Mentis,Leslie Monsour,"(Too sound of mind)

The paper table cloth was tastefully bleak,
The misty morning light shone on his cheek,
And made him look alone and masculine.

He talked of Seneca and bad translations,
Of modern critics' lightweight observations;
A bread crumb rested sweetly on his chin.

Behind him, through the glass, the ocean's heave
Uncurled against the sand, beside his sleeve,
As Eros aimed his toxic javelin.

I ducked out of the way, to no avail;
It glanced my flesh, injecting quite a cocktail
That blurred my sight and caused my head to spin—

Never mind the coffee we were drinking,
Whatever I said was not what I was thinking.
I wanted to become his mandolin,

And lie across his lap, a dainty lute,
And sing to him and feed him ripened fruit,
While light upon the sea turned opaline.

Instead, this conversation about art
And formal education—God, he's smart!
Such rationality should be a sin.

The hour was up, he had to run, of course;
A handshake and a peck of shy remorse—
Outside, the sea was gray and dull as tin;
It ruled the shore with tedious discipline."
155,Nine-Panel Yaak River Screen,Charles Wright,"Midmorning like a deserted room, apparition
Of armoire and table weights,
Oblongs of flat light,
                                      the rosy eyelids of lovers
Raised in their ghostly insurrection,
Decay in the compassed corners beating its black wings,
Late June and the lilac just ajar.

Where the deer trail sinks down through the shadows of blue spruce,
Reeds rustle and bow their heads,
Creek waters murmur on like the lamentation of women
For faded, forgotten things.
And always the black birds in the trees,
Always the ancient chambers thudding inside the heart.

I've made a small hole in the silence, a tiny one,
Just big enough for a word.
And when I rise from the dead, whenever that is, I'll say it.

The day that I rise from the dead, whenever that is.

Sunlight, on one leg, limps out to the meadow and settles in.
Insects fall back inside their voices,
Little fanfares and muted repeats,
Inadequate language of sorrow,
                                                            inadequate language of silted joy,
As ours is.

And we are left with ourselves
As though we were dead, or otherwised, our lips still moving,
The empty distance, the heart
Like a votive little-red-wagon on top of a child's grave,
Nothing touching, nothing close.

A long afternoon, and a long rain begins to fall.
In some other poem, angels emerge from their cold rooms,
Their wings blackened by somebody's dream.

Time gnaws on our necks like a dog
                                                                  gnaws on a stew bone.
It whittles us down with its white teeth,
It sends us packing, leaving no footprints on the dust-dour road.
That's one way of putting it.
Time, like a golden coin, lies on our tongue's another.
We slide it between our teeth on the black water,
                                                                                        ready for what's next.

The white eyelids of dead boys, like flushed birds, flutter up
At the edge of the timber.
Domestic lupin Crayolas the yard.
                                                              Slow lopes of tall grasses
Southbound in the meadow, hurled along by the wind.
In wingbeats and increments,
The disappeared come back to us, the soul returns to the tree.

Master music of sunlight
And black-green darkness under the spruce and tamaracks,
Lull us and take our breath away.
                                                              Our lips form fine words,
But nothing comes out.
Our lips are the messengers, but nothing can come out.

After a day of high winds, how beautiful is the stillness of dusk.
Enormous silence of stones.
Illusion, like an empty coffin, that something is missing.
Monotonous psalm of underbrush
                                                               and smudged flowers.
After the twilight, darkness.
After the darkness, darkness, and then what follows that.

The unborn own all of this, what little we leave them,
St. Thomas's hand
                                   returning repeatedly to the wound,
Their half-formed mouths irrepressible in their half-sleep,
Asking for everything, and then some.
Already the melancholy of their arrival
Swells like a sunrise and daydream
                                                                 over the eastern ridge line.

Inside the pyrite corridors of late afternoon,
Image follows image, clouds
Reveal themselves,
                                    and shadows, like angels, lie at the feet of all things.
Chambers of the afterlife open deep in the woods,
Their secret hieroglyphics suddenly readable
With one eye closed, then with the other.

One star and a black voyage,
                                                     drifting mists to wish on,
Bullbats and their lullabye—
Evening tightens like an elastic around the hills.
Small sounds and the close of day,
As if a corpse had risen from somewhere deep in the meadow
And walked in its shadows quietly.

The mouth inside me with its gold teeth
Begins to open.
No words appear on its lips,
                                                     no syllables bubble along its tongue.
Night mouth, silent mouth.
Like drugged birds in the trees,
                                                          angels with damp foreheads settle down.
Wind rises, clouds arrive, another night without stars."
156,No Time,Billy Collins,"In a rush this weekday morning,
I tap the horn as I speed past the cemetery 
where my parents are buried
side by side beneath a slab of smooth  granite. 

Then, all day, I think of him rising up 
to give me that look 
of knowing disapproval 
while my mother calmly tells him to lie back down."
157,Nogi,Harriet Monroe,"Great soldier of the fighting clan, 
Across Port Arthur's frowning face of stone 
You drew the battle sword of old Japan, 
And struck the White Tsar from his Asian throne.

      Once more the samurai sword 
Struck to the carved hilt in your loyal hand, 
That not alone your heaven-descended lord 
Should meanly wander in the spirit land.

      Your own proud way, O eastern star, 
Grandly at last you followed. Out it leads 
To that high heaven where all the heroes are, 
Lovers of death for causes and for creeds."
158,Nomadology,Alissa Leigh,"In the beginning, a word, move; 
then a plan and then the reasons, 
which I do not remember exactly. 
I remember clearly only the clothes 
we were given for the journey 
and the last, silent meal we ate. 
We left the place as lightly as we 
had come, so many years before. 

From a sunlit state of innocence 
where white sheets were hung 
to dry like clouds over paradise; 
from eucalyptus-scented earth, 
a red house with a yard swung 
between dreaming hills, pillaged 
by raccoons, framed with lilies 
like trumpets of the archangels, 

we moved: into history, a river 
slowed by many bends, a village 
of peacocks with a hundred eyes; 
a low house among fields, with 
an iron stove, a winter shrine; 
a fireplace blackened by time, 
the fragile bones of a sparrow 
frozen in the shape of its flight. 

When father played his trombone 
in the attic, schoolchildren tittered 
in the street. In the late afternoon, 
the cows assembled at the gate, 
witless, waiting for a farmer's son. 
Home, the children conjugated 
verbs, found variables and drew 
diagrams of the human heart. 

Evenings, the round kitchen table, 
lit by a low Dutch lamp, summoned 
poets, players, horsethieves, to glasses 
of jenever. An incense of gossip rose 
slowly, blackening the walls. Outside, 
horses pawed the darkness, breathing 
delicate feathers of ice. We courted 
the favors of spiders, mice and moles. 

Our words grew small and porous as 
fossiled bones, our gestures groaned 
with the cold. The will-less world of 
water, wood and stone taught us when 
to yield. When it came time to move 
along again, we were four strangers 
waving at each other, in slow motion, 
across a deafening expanse of ocean."
159,Novelette,Adrian Blevins,"With her one horrid eye persistently unfastened, a vigilant bird 
watched my grandfather during the Great Depression 
use each evening of one whole year to wander his corn fields 
knowing this world is just one pig after another 

in one pen after another. Therefore, the bird heard him suppose, 
shouldn’t he with his best gun, machete, Buick, or rope 
terminate his acquaintance with the tiresome setup 
of breakfast-lunch-dinner-dawn-dusk-fall-winter-spring-summer- 

blah-blah-blah? But his girls were good-looking 
and made such fine pies, so the bird watched him live wretchedly 
until he died more naturally of cancer 
too soon to see his people become the dopefiends, doctor-haters, 

masturbators, insomniacs, sleep fanatics, shut-ins, and teetotalers 
the bird knew they would become, for the purpose of girls 
is to just ruin everything with wanton reproduction 
so that now now now it’s really relentless—how heavy 

his people got in their limbs and how torrential, thus, 
the frenzied wind, though beyond the eye of the bird 
is the small, ashen brain of the bird, and below that, a heart, 
I swear, through which come the iffy notes of this cruel song."
160,Obbligato,Bruce Smith,"Late August was a pressure drop,  
rain, a sob in the body,  

a handful of air   
with a dream in it,   

summer was desperate   
to paradise itself with blackberry  

drupelets and swarms, everything  
polychromed, glazed, sprinkler caps   

gushing, the stars like sweat  
on a boxer's skin. A voice  

from the day says  
Tax cuts   

for the rich or scratch  
what itches or it's a sax  

from Bitches Brew,  
and I'm a fool   

for these horns  
and hues, this maudlin   

light. It's a currency of feeling   
in unremembered March.  

There's a war on and snow in the 
                city  
where we've made our desire stop  

and start. In the dying school of Bruce  
I'm the student who still believes  

in the bad taste of the beautiful  
and the sadness of songs  

made in the ratio  
of bruise for bruise."
161,THE ODD LAST THING SHE DID,Brad Leithauser,"A car is idling on the cliff. 
Its top is down. Its headlights throw 
A faint, bright ghost-shadow glow 
On the pale air. On the shore, so far 
Below that the waves' push and drag 
Is dwindled to a hush—a kind 
Of oceanic idle—the sea 
Among the boulders plays a blind- 
Fold game of hide and seek, 
Or capture the flag. The flag 
Swells and sways. The car 
Is empty. A Friday, the first week 
Of June. Nineteen fifty-three. 

A car's idling on the cliff, 
But surely it won't be long before 
Somebody stops to investigate 
And things begin to happen fast: 
Men, troops of men will come, 
Arrive with blazing lights, a blast 
Of sirens, followed by still more 
Men. Though not a soul's in sight, 
The peace of the end of the late 
Afternoon—the sun down, but enough light 
Even so to bathe the heavens from 
Horizon to shore in a deep 
And delicate blue—will not keep. 

Confronted with such an overload 
Of questions (most beginning, Why would she... 
So gifted, bright, and only twenty-three), 
Attention will come to fix upon 
This odd last thing she did: leaving 
The car running, the headlights on. 
She stopped—it will transpire—to fill 
The tank a mere two miles down the road. 
(Just sixteen, the kid at the station will 
Quote her as saying, ""What a pity 
You have to work today! It's not right... 
What weather! Goodness, what a night 
It'll be!"" He'll add: ""She sure was pretty."") 

Was there a change of plan? 
Why the stop for gas? Possibly 
She'd not yet made up her mind? Or 
Had made it up but not yet settled 
On a place? Or could it be she knew 
Where she was headed, what she would do— 
And wanted to make sure the car ran 
For hours afterward? Might the car not be, 
Then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- 
In-reverse, meant to direct one not 
Away from but toward the shore 
And its broken boulders, there to spot 
The bobbing white flag of a blouse? 

Her brief note, which will appear 
In the local Leader, contains a phrase 
(""She chanted snatches of old lands"") 
That will muddle the town for three days, 
Until a Professor E. H. Wade 
Pins it to Ophelia—and reprimands 
The police, who, this but goes to show, 
Have not the barest knowledge of Shakespeare, 
Else would never have misread ""lauds"" 
As ""lands."" A Detective Gregg Messing 
Will answer, tersely, ""Afraid 
It's not our bailiwick. Missing 
Persons, yes; missing poems, no."" 

(What's truly tragic's never allowed 
To stand alone for long, of course. 
At each moment there's a crowd 
Of clowns pressing in: the booming ass 
At every wake who, angling a loud 
Necktie in the chip dip, 
Airs his problems with intestinal gas, 
Or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell 
Siding to the grieving mother . . . . Well, 
Wade sent the Leader another briefword: 
""Decades of service to the Bard now force 
Me to amend the girl's little slip. 
'Chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . ."") 

Yet none of her unshakeable entourage 
—Pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, 
And a yearning young grease-monkey—are 
Alerted yet. Still the empty car 
Idles, idles on the cliff, and night 
Isn't falling so much as day 
Is floating out to sea . . . . Soon, whether 
She's found or not, her lights will draw 
Moths and tiny dark-winged things that might 
Be dirt-clumps, ashes. Come what may, 
The night will be lovely, as she foresaw, 
The first stars easing through the blue, 
Engine and ocean breathing together."
162,[OFTEN WHEN HE WAS ADVANCING],Charles Juliet,"often 
when he was advancing 
feeling his way in the night 
he was doubtful    rebelled 
wanted to climb back up 
to the old light 

but a force held him 
enjoined him 
to pursue 
to venture 
once more 
once again 
into the thickest darkness 
of his shadow 

one day 
at the height of his distress 
emptied of all force 
driven to see that 
the inaccessible would not yield 
he admitted that he must 
renounce it 

to his great surprise 
without his having 
to take a single step 
he crossed the threshold 
came into the light"
163,On Munsungun,Ethan Stebbins,"My father in the aluminum stern, cursing  
another fouled blood-knot: all the shits  

and fucks as integral to the art of fishing  
as the bait-fish, little silver smelts  

I sewed like a manual transmission,  
the same inbred order and precision 

needling the leader through the ass, 
out the mouth, through the jaw, out the nostril  

and back down—suffering as my father suffered 
the bastard no-see-ums and the guttering Johnson 

the obligatory dud, orange egg-pearls  
ballooning from its bust underside, hundreds of duds 

like every shit-luck setback that drove us on, 
fed by the huge image of everything  

we'd never caught, moving in joint blindness  
under Munsungun. 
                 And whatever it was  
it was the fight that delivered us—a tension 

like a sequestered muscle, the line 
spooling, unspooling, the holy-shit- 

litany pulled from our awed mouths 
contracting with distance until a whole  

silence surfaced, the viscid, slapping body  
absorbing and reflecting raw light 

like the bit of cornea above a pupil. 
And then his tremendous, decent hands 

brandishing an oar-butt; the brilliant lace  
of the gills, their crumpled hinge flaring 

in bilge water; and the line, whipping 
and shuttling, feeding invisibly back, 

moving on on Munsungun, sons 
survived by the same damn hunt they heired."
164,On the Metro,C. K. Williams,"On the metro, I have to ask a young woman to move the packages beside her to make room for me;


she’s reading, her foot propped on the seat in front of her, and barely looks up as she pulls them to her.


I sit, take out my own book—Cioran, The Temptation to Exist—and notice her glancing up from hers


to take in the title of mine, and then, as Gombrowicz puts it, she “affirms herself physically,” that is,


becomes present in a way she hadn’t been before: though she hasn’t moved, she’s allowed herself


to come more sharply into focus, be more accessible to my sensual perception, so I can’t help but remark


her strong figure and very tan skin—(how literally golden young women can look at the end of summer.)


She leans back now, and as the train rocks and her arm brushes mine she doesn’t pull it away;


she seems to be allowing our surfaces to unite: the fine hairs on both our forearms, sensitive, alive,


achingly alive, bring news of someone touched, someone sensed, and thus acknowledged, known.


I understand that in no way is she offering more than this, and in truth I have no desire for more,


but it’s still enough for me to be taken by a surge, first of warmth then of something like its opposite:


a memory—a girl I’d mooned for from afar, across the table from me in the library in school now,


our feet I thought touching, touching even again, and then, with all I craved that touch to mean,


my having to realize it wasn’t her flesh my flesh for that gleaming time had pressed, but a table leg.


The young woman today removes her arm now, stands, swaying against the lurch of the slowing train,


and crossing before me brushes my knee and does that thing again, asserts her bodily being again,


(Gombrowicz again), then quickly moves to the door of the car and descends, not once looking back,


(to my relief not looking back), and I allow myself the thought that though I must be to her again


as senseless as that table of my youth, as wooden, as unfeeling, perhaps there was a moment I was not."
165,On the Road,John Updike,"Those dutiful dogtrots down airport corridors
while gnawing at a Dunkin' Donuts cruller,
those hotel rooms where the TV remote
waits by the bed like a suicide pistol,
those hours in the air amid white shirts
whose wearers sleep-read through thick staid thrillers,
those breakfast buffets in prairie Marriotts—
such venues of transit grow dearer than home.

The tricycle in the hall, the wife's hasty kiss,
the dripping faucet and uncut lawn—this is life?
No, vita thrives via the road, in the laptop
whose silky screen shimmers like a dark queen's mirror,
in the polished shoe that signifies killer intent,
and in the solitary mission, a bumpy glide
down through the cloud cover to a single runway
at whose end a man just like you guards the Grail."
166,One Angel: Palazzo Arian,Ann Snodgrass,"At San Raffaele Arcangelo

One angel got it all wrong.
She plopped into this
sad century feet first
in her dark clothes.
There wasn't much water
that winter—just a few
puddles really—
to break her fall.
Mud-splattered, she rose
and shook like a canine.
It didn't take long
to see her soaked wings
as a backdrop to all
the nonmagic to which we were
accustomed, or to see
what passed for history
as a forgetting of sorts.
(Was that one or two wars?)
Strange how, as she limped
down a dim vicolo,
some willful disc hovered
above her more florid
than a sky—how the putrid
puddles with their last
reflections could neither
correct nor register that light."
167,The Other Place,William Logan,"The leaves had fallen in that sullen place, 
but none around him knew just where they were. 
The sky revealed no sun. A ragged blur 
remained where each man's face had been a face. 

Two angels soon crept forth with trays of bread, 
circling among the lost like prison guards. 
Love is not love, unless its will affords 
forgiveness for the words that are not said. 

Still he could not believe that this was Hell, 
that others sent before him did not know; 
yet, once his name and memory grew faint, 
it was no worse, perhaps, than a cheap motel. 
It is the love of failure makes a saint. 
He stood up then, but did not try to go."
168,[Over a Cup of Coffee],Stephen Dobyns,"Over a cup of coffee or sitting on a park bench or 

walking the dog, he would recall some incident 

from his youth—nothing significant—climbing a tree 

in his backyard, waiting in left field for a batter's 

swing, sitting in a parked car with a girl whose face 

he no longer remembered, his hand on her breast 

and his body electric; memories to look at with 

curiosity, the harmless behavior of a stranger, with 

nothing to regret or elicit particular joy. And 

although he had no sense of being on a journey, 

such memories made him realize how far he had 

traveled, which, in turn, made him ask how he 

would look back on the person he was now, this 

person who seemed so substantial. These images, it 

was like looking at a book of old photographs, 

recognizing a forehead, the narrow chin, and 

perhaps recalling the story of an older second 

cousin, how he had left long ago to try his luck in 

Argentina or Australia. And he saw that he was 

becoming like such a person, that the day might 

arrive when he would look back on his present self 

as on a distant relative who had drifted off into 

uncharted lands."
169,The Parade,Billy Collins,"How exhilarating it was to march 
along the great boulevards 
in the sunflash of trumpets 
and under all the waving flags—
the flag of ambition, the flag of love. 

So many of us streaming along—
all of humanity, really—
moving in perfect step, 
yet each lost in the room of a private dream. 

How stimulating the scenery of the world, 
the rows of roadside trees, 
the huge curtain of the sky. 

How endless it seemed until we veered 
off the broad turnpike 
into a pasture of high grass, 
headed toward the dizzying cliffs of mortality. 

Generation after generation, 
we keep shouldering forward 
until we step off the lip into space. 

And I should not have to remind you 
that little time is given here 
to rest on a wayside bench, 
to stop and bend to the wildflowers, 
or to study a bird on a branch—

not when the young 
are always shoving from behind, 
not when the old keep tugging us forward, 
pulling on our arms with all their feeble strength."
170,Parmi beaucoup de poèmes / Among Many Poems,Jacques Roubaud,"Parmi beaucoup de poèmes 
Il y en avait un 
Dont je ne parvenais pas à me souvenir 
Sinon que je l'avais composé
Autrefois 
En descendant cette rue 
Du côté des numéros pairs de cette rue 
Baignée d'une matinée limpide 
Une rue de petites boutiques persistantes 
Entre la Seine sinistrée et l'hôpital 
Un poème écrit avec mes pieds 
Comme je compose toujours les poèmes
En silence et dans ma tête et en marchant 
Mais je ne me souviens de rien 
Que de la rue de la lumière et du hasard 
Qui avait fait entrer dans ce poème 
Le mot ""respect"" 
Que je n'ai pas l'habitude de faire vibrer 
Dans les pages mentales de la poésie
Au-delà  de lui il n'y a rien 
Et ce mot ce mot qui ne bouge pas 
Atteste la cessation de la rue 
Comme un arbre oublié de l'espace 

Among Many Poems 

Among many poems 
There was one 
Which I couldn't remember 
Except having made it up 
Long ago 
While going down that street 
On the even-numbered side of that street 
Bathed in a limpid morning 
A street of little shops still lasting 
Between the hospital and the wounded Seine 
A poem written with my feet 
As I always make up my poems 
In silence and in my head while walking 
But I remember nothing 
Except the street the light and the chance 
That had caused the entry in the poem 
Of the word ""respect"" 
That I don't usually set resounding 
In poetry's mental pages 
Beyond it there is nothing 
And this word this unmoving word  
Awaits the ending of the street 
Like a tree space has forgotten"
171,Paschal,Robert Pinsky,"Easter was the old North   
Goddess of the dawn.   
She rises daily in the East   
And yearly in spring for the great   

Paschal candle of the sun.   
Her name lingers like a spot   
Of gravy in the figured vestment   
Of the language of the Britains.   

Her totem the randy bunny.   
Our very Thursdays and Wednesdays   
Are stained by syllables of thunder   
And Woden's frenzy.   

O my fellow-patriots loyal to this   
Our modern world of high heels,   
Vaccination, brain surgery—   
May they pass over us, the old   

Jovial raptors, Apollonian flayers,   
Embodiments. Egg-hunt,   
Crucifixion. Supper of encrypted   
Dishes: bitter, unrisen, a platter   

Compass of martyrdom,   
Ground-up apples and walnuts   
In sweet wine to embody mortar   
Of affliction, babies for bricks.   

Legible traces of the species   
That devises the angel of death   
Sailing over our doorpost   
Smeared with sacrifice."
172,Pauline Is Falling,Jean Nordhaus,"from the cliff's edge, 
kicking her feet in panic and despair 
as the circle of light contracts and blackness 
takes the screen. And that 
is how we leave her, hanging—though we know 
she will be rescued, only to descend 
into fresh harm, the story flowing on, 
disaster and reprieve—systole, diastole—split 
rhythm of a heart that hungers 

only to go on. So why is this like my mother, 
caged in a railed bed, each breath, 
a fresh installment in a tortured tale 
of capture and release? Nine days 
she dangled, stubborn, 
over the abyss, the soft clay crumbling 
beneath her fingertips, until she dropped 
with a little bird cry of surprise 
into the swift river below. 

Here metaphor collapses, for there was no love 
to rescue her, no small boat 
waiting with a net to fish her out, 
although the water carried her, 
and it was April when we buried her 
among the weeping cherries and the waving 
flags and in the final fade, a heron 
breasted the far junipers 
to gain the tremulous air and swim away."
173,The Perfect Life,John Koethe,"I have a perfect life. It isn't much,   
 But it's enough for me. It keeps me alive   
 And happy in a vague way: no disappointments   
 On the near horizon, no pangs of doubt;   
 Looking forward in anticipation, looking back   
 In satisfaction at the conclusion of each day.   
 I heed the promptings of my inner voice,   
 And what I hear is comforting, full of reassurance   
 For my own powers and innate superiority—the fake   
 Security of someone in the grip of a delusion,   
 In denial, climbing ever taller towers   
 Like a tiny tyrant looking on his little kingdom   
 With a secret smile, while all the while 

 Time lies in wait. And what feels ample now   
 Turns colorless and cold, and what seems beautiful 
 And strong becomes an object of indifference   
 Reaching out to no one, as later middle age   
 Turns old, and the strength is gone.   
 Right now the moments yield to me sweet   
 Feelings of contentment, but the human   
 Dies, and what I take for granted bears a name 
 To be forgotten soon, as the things I know   
 Turn into unfamiliar faces   
 In a strange room, leaving merely   
 A blank space, like a hole left in the wake   
 Of a perfect life, which closes over."
175,The Piper,Joseph Campbell,"George Borrow in his Lavengro 
Tells us of a Welshman, who
By some excess of mother-wit
Framed a harp and played on it,
Built a ship and sailed to sea,
And steered it home to melody
Of his own making. I, indeed,
Might write for Everyman to read
A thaumalogue of wonderment
More wonderful, but rest content
With celebrating one I knew
Who built his pipes, and played them, too:
No more.
                 Ah, played! Therein is all:
The hounded thing, the hunter's call;
The shudder, when the quarry's breath
Is drowned in blood and stilled in death;
The marriage dance, the pulsing vein,

The kiss that must be given again; 
The hope that Ireland, like a rose, 
Sees shining thro' her tale of woes; 
The battle lost, the long lament 
For blood and spirit vainly spent; 
And so on, thro' the varying scale 
Of passion that the western Gael 
Knows, and by miracle of art 
Draws to the chanter from the heart 
Like water from a hidden spring, 
To leap or murmur, weep or sing.

I see him now, a little man 
In proper black, whey-bearded, wan, 
With eyes that scan the eastern hills 
Thro' thick, gold-rimmèd spectacles. 
His hand is on the chanter. Lo, 
The hidden spring begins to flow 
In waves of magic. (He is dead 
These seven years, but bend your head
And listen.) Rising from the clay 
The Master plays The Ring of Day. 
It mounts and falls and floats away 
Over the sky-line . . . then is gone 
Into the silence of the dawn!"
176,Planting the Meadow,Mary Makofske,"I leave the formal garden of schedules 
where hours hedge me, clip the errant sprigs 
of thought, and day after day, a boxwood 
topiary hunt chases a green fox 
never caught. No voice calls me to order 
as I enter a dream of meadow, kneel 
to earth and, moving east to west, second 
the motion only of the sun. I plant 
frail seedlings in the unplowed field, trusting 
the wildness hidden in their hearts. Spring light 
sprawls across false indigo and hyssop, 
daisies, flax. Clouds form, dissolve, withhold 
or promise rain. In time, outside of time, 
the unkempt afternoons fill up with flowers."
177,Platonic Love,Curt Anderson,"We dine at Adorno and return to my Beauvoir. 
She compliments me on my Bachelard pad. 
I pop in a Santayana CD and Saussure back to the couch. 
On my way, I pull out two fine Kristeva wine glasses. 
I pour some Merleau-Ponty and return the Aristotle to Descartes. 
After pausing an Unamuno, I wrap my arm around her Hegel. 
Her hair smells of wild Lukacs and Labriola. 
Our small talk expands to include Dewey, Moore and Kant. 
I confess to her what's in my Eckhart. We Locke. 
By this point, we're totally Blavatsky. 
We stretch out on the Schopenhauer. 
She slips out of her Lyotard and I fumble with my Levi-Strauss. 
She unhooks her Buber and I pull off my Spinoza. 
I run my finger along her Heraclitus as she fondles my Bacon. 
She stops to ask me if I brought any Kierkegaard. I nod. 
We Foucault. 
She lights a cigarette and compares Foucault to Lacan. 
I roll over and Derrida."
178,Playing Dead,Andrew Hudgins,"Our father liked to play a game.   
He played that he was dead.   
He took his thick black glasses off   
and stretched out on the bed.      
   
He wouldn’t twitch and didn’t snore   
or move in any way.   
He didn’t even seem to breathe!   
We asked, Are you okay?   
   
We tickled fingers up and down   
his huge, pink, stinky feet—   
He didn’t move; he lay as still   
as last year’s parakeet.   
   
We pushed our fingers up his nose,   
and wiggled them inside—   
Next, we peeled his eyelids back.   
 Are you okay? we cried.   
   
I really thought he might be dead   
and not just playing possum,   
because his eyeballs didn’t twitch   
when I slid my tongue across ’em.   
   
 He’s dead, we sobbed—but to be sure,   
I jabbed him in the jewels.      
He rose, like Jesus, from the dead,      
though I don’t think Jesus drools.   
   
His right hand lashed both right and left.   
His left hand clutched his scrotum.   
And the words he yelled—I know damn well   
I’m way too young to quote ’em."
179,The Poet's Life: From Martial's Epigrams,Gary Schmidgall,"i.110  

""Much too long"" you say, Velox, censorious, 
Of my epigrams—that's quite uproarious. 
You write none. Your brevity is glorious. 

• 

Scribere me quereris, Velox, epigrammata longa. 
     ipse nihil scribis: tu breviora facis? 

vi.60  

For my small books Rome's gone utterly mad; 
I'm quite ubiquitous—call it a fad. 
Look, there—see that fellow, leafing, curious. 
First he blushes deeply, then he's furious; 
A moment later his eyes glaze over; 
He yawns, flips a page, then reels in horror. 
This mercurial response I thrill to see; 
Why, then my epigrams even please me! 

• 

Laudat, amat, cantat nostros mea Roma libellos, 
     meque sinus omnes, me manus omnis habet. 
ecce rubet quidam, pallet, stupet, oscitat, odit. 
     hoc volo: nunc nobis carmina nostra placent. 

vii.90  

Matho's one-word review of my small book: 
""Uneven."" I'm supposed to get all shook! 
The scribblings of Calvinus and Umber 
Are very ""even"". . . yet how they lumber. 
I swear to you, Creticus, I thank God 
My gift is for being quite frankly ""odd.""

• 

Iactat inaequalem Matho me fecisse libellum:

     si verum est, laudat carmina nostra Matho. 
aequales scribit libros Calvinus et Umber: 
     aequalis liber est, Cretice, qui malus est. 

ix.50  

You pontificate my talent is small, 
Gaurus, because my epigrams are all 
Just puny trifles. Yet they seem to please, 
I'll confess. They're a veritable breeze 
Compared to your epic tome, which rattles, 
In twelve mortal books, o'er Priam's battles. 
That makes you big man on campus? Oh no! 
As statuettes of master carvers glow 
With life, so do my tiny dramas boast 
Vital creatures. Your giants? Clay, at most. 

• 

Ingenium mihi, Gaure, probas sic esse pusillum, 
     carmina quod faciam quae brevitate placent. 
confiteor. sed tu bis senis grandia libris 
     qui scribis Priami proelia, magnus homo es? 
nos facimus Bruti puerum, nos Langona vivum:

     tu magnus luteum, Gaure, Giganta facis. 

iv.49  

Quite clueless, Flaccus, all these sorry folks 
Who brand short poems mere badinage and jokes. 
Want to know who's more idle? The big boys, 
Our Epic Poets, who rehearse the joys 
Of serving human flesh up à la carte—

Tereus' bloody banquet or the huge tart 
Chez Thyestes (""It's a little gristly!""). 
Or they serve us crap, like how remissly 
Daedalus made—with wax, imagine!—wings 
For his poor doomed son. Then Big Epic sings 
Of arms and the—not ""man""—one-eyed giant? 
Polyphemus: his brain was far from pliant, 
So Homer made him watch sheep in Sicily. 
Pardon me for carping so pissily, 
Flaccus, at insults to my epigrams, 
So far from the bloated whimsy that crams 
Our big-assed epics. All men blare in praise 
of these ""classics,"" you say, and bask in their rays. 
I will not disagree, but mark my word: 
Some day, far off, a wise man will be heard 
To say, ""Classics we all want to have read, 
Never to read."" My books get read instead! 

• 

Nescit, crede mihi, quid sint epigrammata, Flacce, 
     qui tantum lusus illa iocosque vocat. 
ille magis ludit qui scribit prandia saevi 
     Tereos aut cenam, crude Thyesta, tuam, 
aut puero liquidas aptantem Daedalon alas, 
     pascentem Siculas aut Polyphemon ovis. 
a nostris procul est omnis vesica libellis, 
     Musa nec insano syrmate nostra tumet. 
""illa tamen laudant omnes, mirantur, adorant.""

     confiteor: laudant illa, sed ista legunt. 

ix.81 

Read or recited, my verse is much praised, 
Aulus, yet one poet opines: ""Ill-phrased.""

I couldn't care less! When I set a table, 
My guests, not the cooks, should say I'm able. 

• 

Lector et auditor nostros probat, Aule, libellos, 
     sed quidam exactos esse poeta negat. 
non nimium curo: nam cenae fercula nostrae 
     malim convivis quam placuisse cocis. 

x.59  

A whole damned page crammed with verse—so you yawn! 
If a poem's too long you move swiftly on; 
""Shorter the better!"" is your golden rule. 
But markets are scoured to make the tongue drool; 
A groaning board's set—rich sauces for days—

And yet, dear reader, you want canapés? 
But I don't hunger for diners so prude: 
Hail meat and potatoes—screw finger food! 

• 

Consumpta est uno si lemmate pagina, transis, 
     et breviora tibi, non meliora placent. 
dives et ex omni posita est instructa macello 
     cena tibi, sed te mattea sola iuvat. 
non opus est nobis nimium lectore guloso; 
     hunc volo, non fiat qui sine pane satur. 

xi.16  

You there, reader, the over-solemn one, 
Take a hike wherever—my verse is spun 
Only for blithe, witty cognoscenti 
""Up"" for priapic jeux de spree aplenty 
Or aroused by bells on harlot's fingers. 
He who in these randy pages lingers—

Though more stern than Curius or Fabricius 
Soon gets tingly, and anon lubricious; 
Then, lo, beneath a toga something pokes. 
My little book's salacious whims and jokes 
Will lead even the chastest dames astray; 
Taken with wine, my lines can make 'em bray! 
Lucretia, more proper than whom none such, 
Peeked between my covers, blushed very much, 
And threw me down (but Brutus stood glowering). 
Brutus, ""Ciao!""—and back she'll be devouring. 

• 

Qui gravis es nimium, potes hinc iam, lector, abire 
     quo libet: urbanae scripsimus ista togae; 
iam mea Lampsacio lascivit pagina versu 
     et Tartesiaca concrepat aera manu. 
o quotiens rigida pulsabis pallia vena, 
     sis gravior Curio Fabricioque licet! 
tu quoque nequitias nostri lususque libelli 
     uda, puella, leges, sis Patavina licet. 
erubuit posuitque meum Lucretia librum, 
     sed coram Bruto; Brute, recede: leget. 

iv.89 

Hey, you're stuffed, little book, give it a rest. 
You've reached the end-papers and still have zest! 
What on earth makes you yet want to let go, 
When ""misfire"" our verse reeked from the get-go? 
Zip it, my pages, let's call a ""time out""; 
We've hit the back cover—and still you'd spout? 
Look, the reader's pissed and quite unimpressed; 
Even our publisher calls you a pest: 
""Hey, you're stuffed, little book, give it a rest!""

• 

Ohe, iam satis, ohe, libelle, 
iam pervenimus usque ad umbilicos. 
tu procedere adhuc et ire quaeris, 
nec summa potes in schida teneri, 
sic tamquam tibi res peracta non sit, 
quae prima quoque pagina peracta est. 
iam lector queriturque deficitque, 
iam librarius hoc et ipse dicit 
""ohe, iam satis est, ohe, libelle."""
180,Poetry,Arthur Davison Ficke,"I

   It is a little isle amid bleak seas—
An isolate realm of garden, circled round
By importunity of stress and sound,
Devoid of empery to master these.
At most, the memory of its streams and bees,
Borne to the toiling mariner outward—bound,
Recalls his soul to that delightful ground;
But serves no beacon toward his destinies.

   It is a refuge from the stormy days,
Breathing the peace of a remoter world
Where beauty, like the musing dusk of even,
Enfolds the spirit in its silver haze;
While far away, with glittering banners furled,
The west lights fade, and stars come out in heaven.

II

   It is a sea—gate, trembling with the blast
Of powers that from the infinite sea—plain roll,
A whelming tide. Upon the waiting soul
As on a fronting rock, thunders the vast
Groundswell; its spray bursts heavenward, and drives past
In fume and sound articulate of the whole
Of ocean’s heart, else voiceless; on the shoal
Silent; upon the headland clear at last.

   From darkened sea—coasts without stars or sun,
Like trumpet—voices in a holy war,
Utter the heralds tidings of the deep.
And where men slumber, weary and undone,
Visions shall come, incredible hopes from far,—
And with high passion shatter the bonds of sleep."
181,Posthumous,Jean Nordhaus,"Would it surprise you to learn
that years beyond your longest winter
you still get letters from your bank, your old
philanthropies, cold flakes drifting
through the mail-slot with your name?
Though it's been a long time since your face
interrupted the light in my door-frame,
and the last tremblings of your voice
have drained from my telephone wire,
from the lists of the likely, your name
is not missing. It circles in the shadow-world
of the machines, a wind-blown ghost. For generosity
will be exalted, and good credit
outlasts death. Caribbean cruises, recipes,
low-interest loans. For you who asked
so much of life, who lived acutely
even in duress, the brimming world
awaits your signature. Cancer and heart disease
are still counting on you for a cure.
B'nai Brith numbers you among the blessed.
They miss you. They want you back."
182,PREHISTORIC,Claire Malroux,"Whitecaps surge in from some infinite distance 
Rocks, grottoes, clay stridencies beneath the storm 
Amalgams of sea-wrack and brownish moss 
Each tide pushes forth its flesh-antennae 
The persistent squid stretches its arms, wave-crests 
Cave in, everything gives way to sand 
Which silently drinks up the acid, cold red sweat 
Those children launched in assault against the waves 
How could they turn their heads 
Back toward those who've brought them this far 
To be taken even farther in their turn 
They passed though the crowd, laughing 
Or crying without telling the password 
They've passed, the ferret runs and runs 
Memory, the battlefield nurse, can barely 
Triage the rarest ones 
Whose heat shifts at the crater's edge 
Yet they give our trajectory 
Its dreamlike depth: the whole chain 
Coils up in our smallest cells 
And in a lifetime time annuls itself"
183,Progressive Health,Carl Dennis,"We here at Progressive Health would like to thank you   
For being one of the generous few who've promised   
To bequeath your vital organs to whoever needs them.   

Now we'd like to give you the opportunity   
To step out far in front of the other donors   
By acting a little sooner than you expected,   

Tomorrow, to be precise, the day you're scheduled   
To come in for your yearly physical. Six patients   
Are waiting this very minute in intensive care   

Who will likely die before another liver   
And spleen and pairs of lungs and kidneys   
Match theirs as closely as yours do. Twenty years,   

Maybe more, are left you, granted, but the gain   
Of these patients might total more than a century.   
To you, of course, one year of your life means more   

Than six of theirs, but to no one else,   
No one as concerned with the general welfare   
As you've claimed to be. As for your poems— 

The few you may have it in you to finish— 
Even if we don't judge them by those you've written,   
Even if we assume you finally stage a breakthrough,   

It's doubtful they'll raise one Lazarus from a grave   
Metaphoric or literal. But your body is guaranteed   
To work six wonders. As for the gaps you'll leave   

As an aging bachelor in the life of friends,   
They'll close far sooner than the open wounds   
Soon to be left in the hearts of husbands and wives,   

Parents and children, by the death of the six   
Who now are failing. Just imagine how grateful   
They'll all be when they hear of your grand gesture.   

Summer and winter they'll visit your grave, in shifts,   
For as long as they live, and stoop to tend it,   
And leave it adorned with flowers or holly wreaths,   

While your friends, who are just as forgetful   
As you are, just as liable to be distracted,   
Will do no more than a makeshift job of upkeep.   

If the people you'll see tomorrow pacing the halls   
Of our crowded facility don't move you enough,   
They'll make you at least uneasy. No happy future   

Is likely in store for a man like you whose conscience   
Will ask him to certify every hour from now on   
Six times as full as it was before, your work   

Six times as strenuous, your walks in the woods   
Six times as restorative as anyone else's.   
Why be a drudge, staggering to the end of your life   

Under this crushing burden when, with a single word,   
You could be a god, one of the few gods   
Who, when called on, really listens?"
184,Pura Vida,John Updike,"(¡Pura vida! —Costa Rican phrase for ""O.K."" or ""Great!"")

Such heat! It brings the brain back to its basic blank. 
Small, recurrent events become the daily news— 
the white-nosed coati treading the cecropia's 
bending thin branches like sidewalks in the sky, 
the scarlet-rumped tanager flitting like a spark 
in the tinder of dank green, the nodding palm leaves 
perforated like Jacquard cards in a code of wormholes, 
the black hawk skimming nothingness over and over. 

What does the world's wide brimming mean, with hunger 
the unstated secret, dying the proximate reality? 
Con mucho gusto—the muchness extends to the stars, 
as wet and numerous as larvae underground 
where the ants in their preset patterns scurry and nurture, 
and the queen, immobilized, pours forth her eggs 
in the dark. We are far from oaks and stoplights, 
from England's chill classrooms and Tuscany's paved hills. 

For thought is a stridulation, an insect sizzling, 
knit of the moment's headlines and temperate-zone quips, 
viable in the debris of our rotting educations, 
that thatch where peer-groups call each to each in semes 
ecosystematically. Great God Himself 
wilts with a rise in temperature, a drop in soil acidity, 
a new language in its grimacing opacity. 
The brain's dry buzz revives, a bit, as evening falls."
185,Rage for Order,David Lunde,"I guess you could call it
a sort of sympathetic magic.
How else to explain
this obsessive reorganizing
of my home, my books, my papers,
my poems, this housekeeping
of my hard drive and floppies,
all the deleting and casting away
of redundancy and obsolescence,
dead files and moved-on addresses
and the scrubbing, the constant
scrubbing and dusting and the howl
of the protesting vacuum
that struggles to inhale
at least the 70% of house-dust
that is dead human skin
some of which might be hers."
186,"Reading an Anthology of Chinese Poems of the Sung Dynasty, I pause to Admire the Length and Clarity of their Titles",Billy Collins,"It seems these poets have nothing
up their ample sleeves
they turn over so many cards so early,
telling us before the first line
whether it is wet or dry,
night or day, the season the man is standing in,
even how much he has had to drink.

Maybe it is autumn and he is looking at a sparrow.
Maybe it is snowing on a town with a beautiful name.

""Viewing Peonies at the Temple of Good Fortune
on a Cloudy Afternoon"" is one of Sun Tung Po's.
""Dipping Water from the River and Simmering Tea""
is another one, or just
""On a Boat, Awake at Night.""

And Lu Yu takes the simple rice cake with
""In a Boat on a Summer Evening
I Heard the Cry of a Waterbird.
It Was Very Sad and Seemed To Be Saying
My Woman Is Cruel—Moved, I Wrote This Poem.""

There is no iron turnstile to push against here
as with headings like ""Vortex on a String,""
""The Horn of Neurosis,"" or whatever.
No confusingly inscribed welcome mat to puzzle over.

Instead, ""I Walk Out on a Summer Morning
to the Sound of Birds and a Waterfall""
is a beaded curtain brushing over my shoulders.

And ""Ten Days of Spring Rain Have Kept Me Indoors""
is a servant who shows me into the room
where a poet with a thin beard
is sitting on a mat with a jug of wine
whispering something about clouds and cold wind,
about sickness and the loss of friends.

How easy he has made it for me to enter here,
to sit down in a corner,
cross my legs like his, and listen."
187,REPULSIVE THEORY,Kay Ryan,"Little has been made  
of the soft, skirting action  
of magnets reversed,  
while much has been  
made of attraction.  
But is it not this pillowy  
principle of repulsion  
that produces the  
doily edges of oceans  
or the arabesques of thought?  
And do these cutout coasts  
and incurved rhetorical beaches  
not baffle the onslaught  
of the sea or objectionable people  
and give private life  
what small protection it's got?  
Praise then the oiled motions  
of avoidance, the pearly  
convolutions of all that  
slides off or takes a  
wide berth; praise every  
eddying vacancy of Earth,  
all the dimpled depths  
of pooling space, the whole  
swirl set up by fending-off—  
extending far beyond the personal,  
I'm convinced—  
immense and good  
in a cosmological sense:  
unpressing us against  
each other, lending  
the necessary never 
to never-ending."
188,Requiem Shark,Rad Smith,"This morning as I gulp five gleaming white 
capsules of shark cartilage 
to make me strong again, I want 
another look at the terrible 
eye with its nictitating membrane, 
those extravagant fins, 
the ampullae of Lorenzini freckling its snout, 
all of that huge body on the rippled sand 
in turtle grass 
with an entourage of neon-blue barjacks, 
and a remora wriggling in 
and out of its gill-slits. 
I even want to touch it again, 
and this time not just with my fingertips, 
but my palm, loveline and lifeline, 
my wrist, the underside of my forearm. 
I want to press my cheek against its chaste 
astonishing skin smooth as a headstone, 
want the touch that feels like a blow, 
the summoning touch, the touch 
of reckoning, the consummating touch, as well as 
the stinging sandblown touch of regret, 
the stranger's touch on the train, 
the reproachful touch, 
even the last touch of a human 
who has lain down with a shark, 
the touch I have spent my life so ignorant of, 
your touch as you unbutton my shirt, 
the searing, unbearable touch."
189,Triolets in the Argolid,Rachel Hadas,"Return

The taste is strong as ever,
figs and cheese and wine.
I recall each savor;
the taste is strong as ever,
even if it will never
be quite so fresh again.
The taste is strong as ever,
figs and cheese and wine.

 Obverse

Two sides of one coin
love and worry seem.
Both of them are mine:
two sides of one coin,
two links in one chain,
left/right of one brain?
Two sides of one coin
love and worry seem.

 Metamorphosis

Why does transformation
sneak up on us so?
In life, not just narration,
why does transformation
creep up—yes, in slow motion,
inexorably, though?
Why does transformation
sneak up on us so?

 Technology

Where are worry beads
now people have cell phones
clamped against their heads?
Where are worry beads?
Ancient human needs,
new millennium;
where are worry beads?
People have cell phones.

 Fortress

Before we reach the top,
street sounds fade away.
Many steep steps up
before we reach the top;
just when did they stop?
Silence; scalding sky.
Before we reach the top,
street sounds fade away.

 Dactylic

Tino's counting on his fingers.
Syllables and rhyme;
a faint Sapphic cadence lingers.
Tino's counting on his fingers.
Generations of singers
keeping, conquering time.
Tino's counting on his fingers;
syllables and rhyme."
190,Revelations in the Key of K,Mary Karr,"I came awake in kindergarten,   
under the letter K chalked neat   
on a field-green placard leaned   

on the blackboard's top edge. They'd caged   me   
in a metal desk—the dull word writ   
to show K's sound. But K meant kick and kill

when a boy I'd kissed drew me   
as a whiskered troll in art. On my sheet,   
the puffy clouds I made to keep rain in   

let torrents dagger loose. ""Screw those   
who color in the lines,"" my mom had preached,   
words I shared that landed me on a short chair   

facing the corner's empty, sheetrock page. Craning up,   
I found my K high above.   
 You'll have to grow to here, its silence said.   

And in the surrounding alphabet, my whole life hid—  
names of my beloveds, sacred vows I'd break.   
With my pencil stub applied to wall,   

I moved around the loops and vectors,   
Z to A, learning how to mean, how   
in the mean world to be.   

But while I worked the room around me   
began to smudge—like a charcoal sketch my mom   
was rubbing with her thumb. Then   

the instant went, the month, and every season   
smeared, till with a wrenching arm tug   
I was here, grown, but still bent   

to set down words before the black eraser   
swipes our moment into cloud, dispersing all   
to zip. And when I blunder in the valley   

of the shadow of blank about to break   
in half, my being leans against my spinal K,   
which props me up, broomstick straight,   

a strong bone in the crypt of meat I am."
191,Reverie in Open Air,Rita Dove,"I acknowledge my status as a stranger:   
Inappropriate clothes, odd habits   
Out of sync with wasp and wren.   
I admit I don’t know how   
To sit still or move without purpose.   
I prefer books to moonlight, statuary to trees.   

But this lawn has been leveled for looking,   
So I kick off my sandals and walk its cool green.   
Who claims we’re mere muscle and fluids?   
My feet are the primitives here.   
As for the rest—ah, the air now   
Is a tonic of absence, bearing nothing   
But news of a breeze."
192,Road,Lisa Williams,"This is what poetry is (says the Road), 
a laying down of uniform pattern 
across a land you can't control 
but which you think it best to flatten. 
It's far from vivid. Look at the whole 
flamboyant forest! Look at the paths 
that can't be uttered by a mouth 
and at the scattered arcs of light 
more integral to this wide planet 
than words will ever be. Your lines? 
Like railroad tracks that cut the bracken, 
bring something through, then disappear. 
No one knows what speck was taken 
or where it moved, and no one cares."
193,Rogue Russets,R. T. Smith,"Surprised by a frill of white flower 
where I'd never planted an eye, 
I decided to fence it with sticks 

and let the renegade live 
in undoctored soil where the garden 
gave way to volunteer poplars 

and acidic white pine. Why not? 
After all, away from the tribe, 
in clay where beetles drill 

and weeds emerge inspired, 
it might grow eccentric, proliferate 
and thrive. 
           When autumn air 

said disinter, to fill the bin 
for winter, I troweled under 
and pulled the stem 

until a rabble of rough spuds 
red as Etruscan urns emerged 
as if to prove 

that whatever urge drove 
the rogue to sow itself and strive 
beyond all cultivation 

might offer a vital lesson 
to any apostate instinct 
aspiring to survive."
194,Royalty,Lianne Spidel,"""I gave birth to a princess,"" her mother 
once told me, and I thought of my son pouring 
his Grape-Nuts in the garage so as not to wake her, 

of the moment her baby, seeing her 
now a separate entity, seemed not to breathe, 
refused to blink her sapphire eyes. 

I remembered again last night as she 
and I crossed a Florida street, the caution 
light running gold streamers 

over the dark sweep of her hair, 
when a young man coming toward us halted 
midway a moment, stunned, before moving on. 

So what is this Divine Right—less 
than bloodlines, or more? More than symmetry 
of face or a silver necklace nestled 

at a flawless throat, the nerve to send back 
bad food in restaurants, more than the big, 
loopy handwriting of the generous spirit? 

Call it bravery, that eager readiness 
in the eyes, the quality of the light shining 
there. Call it blessed assurance. 

Today, pony-tailed, she luxuriates in sun, 
opulent in a hot pink bikini. In deference 
the ocean leans away, a backdrop. 

I find myself bent, studying the shore for perfect 
shells to lay at her feet—cat's paw, prickly 
cockle, angel wing. Call it homage, more or less."
195,Rue,Samuel Menashe,"For what I did
And did not do
And do without
In my old age
Rue, not rage
Against that night
We go into,
Sets me straight
On what to do
Before I die—
Sit in the shade,
Look at the sky"
196,SALVATION,James Kimbrell,"It’s not that I harbor a weeping willow
Shadow’s worth of longing for those cloaked
 Turns and straight-aways, or that swampy
South Mississippi was ever half as tragic
 As I dreamed it could be, but that I still cruise
From time to time in the dope-ripe
 Ford Fairlane of the mind where nothing
Has changed, where we remain hopelessly
 Stoned devotees of the TOWN OF LEAKESVILLE 
Emblazoned upon the graffitied water tower’s
 Testimonies to love. We believed speed
Would save us, would take us fast
 And far away from the junkyard wrecks
Stacked in their mile-long convoy to nowhere.
 And though losing the way should
Have seemed the worst of divine betrayals,
 We took it as a minor fall from grace,
Tail-spun over the embankment rail, rocking
 That flung steel body down as if to play
A bar-chord on the barbed-wire fence.
 I’ll never know what angelic overseer
Was bored and on duty that night, but we
 Rose up and climbed out of the warped last
Breath of that car, no one with so much
 As a scratch on his head, not a drop
Of beer spilt, and the radiator hissing
 Like a teapot in hell when someone yelled
She’s gonna blow! and each of us standing
 There, starving for something more,
Something other than the black wheel
 Spinning that sudden dark, cricketed quiet."
198,School of Flesh,Dana Levin,"And blush for a cheek of stone.  

      Blush for the lips sewn tight with thread, no speech for the dead  
      maker—  

       
      You’ve got the razor. You can make each suture snap.  

       
      And watch the mouth    
bloom up with foam,  
      as if he’d drowned himself in soap—  

      You lift the neck and let the head drop back.  
The mouth yawns wide its prize—  

       
      White thrive.  
The larval joy.  
      Hot in their gorge on the stew of balms,  
a moist exhale—  
      as if there were a last breath, a taunt  
coiling  
      into your inner ear, Good Dog, you dig your hands in,  
up-cupping  
      the glossal  
bed—  

       
      saying, Graduate  
of the School of Flesh,  
      Father Conspirator—  

      I will learn it.  
      I will bite the tongue from the corpse."
199,Scrapbook,George Scarbrough,"Green and brown current of river:
Reverberant iron bridge: crossing over,
Woman and child fixed at the center,
Holding hands and both weeping:

Because her child is weeping: because
His mother weeps: because the river, far
Underfoot, glitters through cracks
In the wooden flooring that widen

Perceptively as he steps.
Ahead, heightened by a hill, dwarfed
In yellow trees, the house is made ready.
All should have been primer-perfect,

Including the train rushing headlong
Past the station, always in arrears,
Never deigning to stop and put down
A stepping-stool. Nothing more is given:

Except perhaps an assignment of cause:
A plank has fallen away to the river.
The two figures clasp hands across the gulf,
Rocking back and forth in soundless

Oscillation there on the bridge
Where my mind proposes to leave them
In place, my mother and me,
On the first day of school, 1921."
200,Searchers,D. Nurkse,"We gave our dogs a button to sniff,   
or a tissue, and they bounded off   
confident in their training,   
in the power of their senses   
to recreate the body,   

but after eighteen hours in rubble   
where even steel was pulverized   
they curled on themselves   
and stared up at us   
and in their soft huge eyes   
we saw mirrored the longing for death:   

then we had to beg a stranger   
to be a victim and crouch   
behind a girder, and let the dogs   
discover him and tug him   
proudly, with suppressed yaps,   
back to Command and the rows   
of empty triage tables.   

But who will hide from us?   
Who will keep digging for us   
here in the cloud of ashes?"

202,Sequestrienne,Dorothea Tanning,"Don't look at me  
for answers. Who am I but  
a sobriquet,  
a teeth-grinder,  
grinder of color,  
and vanishing point?  

There was a time  
of middle distance, unforgettable,  
a sort of lace-cut  
flame-green filament  
to ravish my  
skin-tight eyes.  

I take that back—  
it was forgettable but not  
entirely if you  
consider my  
heavenly bodies . . .  
I loved them so.  

Heaven's motes sift  
to salt-white—paint is ground  
to silence; and I,  
I am bound, unquiet,  
a shade of blue  
in the studio.  

If it isn't too late  
let me waste one day away  
from my history.  
Let me see without  
looking inside  
at broken glass."
203,Sharks' Teeth,Kay Ryan,"Everything contains some   
silence. Noise gets
its zest from the
small shark's-tooth
shaped fragments
of rest angled
in it. An hour   
of city holds maybe   
a minute of these   
remnants of a time   
when silence reigned,   
compact and dangerous   
as a shark. Sometimes   
a bit of a tail   
or fin can still   
be sensed in parks."
204,She Considers the Dimensions of Her Soul,Young Smith,"The shape of her soul is a square. 
She knows this to be the case 
because she often feels its corners 
pressing sharp against the bone 
just under her shoulder blades 
and across the wings of her hips. 
At one time, when she was younger, 
she had hoped that it might be a cube, 
but the years have worked to dispel 
this illusion of space, so that now 
she understands: it is a simple plane, 
a shape with surface, but no volume— 
a window without a building, an eye 
without a mind. 
                        Of course, this square 
does not appear on x-rays, and often, 
weeks may pass when she forgets 
that it exists. When she does think 
to consider its purpose in her life, 
she can say only that it aches with 
a single mystery, for whose answer 
she has long ago given up the search— 
since its question is a word whose name 
can never quite be asked. This yearning, 
she has concluded, is the only function 
of the square, repeated again and again 
in each of its four matching angles, 
until, with time, she is persuaded 
anew that what it frames has no 
interest in ever making her happy."
205,Shell,Harriet Brown,"I found it in the wash, the orange
shell I picked up on the beach
that last time. One of my girls—
the one named after you—

must have found it in my room
and wanted it. Clean calcareous
curve, a palm open to nothing,
reeking of sunshine

and your death. For years
I didn't know what to do with it.
You would have liked
this story: how a child

slips grief into a careless pocket.
Breaks it to pieces. Lets it go."
206,The Shoes,Brent Pallas,"When they first came 
their mouths agape 
their bodies shining 
like beetles about to stir 

every edge poised 
for the multitude of steps 
some moment 
of leaping not yet taken 

their hides stiff 
shielding some tenderness 
within, warming 
to the creak of movement 

over penitent steps 
or dusty wastes, unyielding 
tasks or stony memorials 
of waiting 

through the heat of day's 
quiet middle, every icy 
threshold or soggy spring 
their heels flush with pavement, 

their soles flung aside only 
for love, all the tattered 
maps of their seams, every 
unforgiving rub."
207,Silence,Billy Collins,"There is the sudden silence of the crowd 
above a player not moving on the field, 
and the silence of the orchid. 

The silence of the falling vase 
before it strikes the ﬂoor, 
the silence of the belt when it is not striking the child. 

The stillness of the cup and the water in it, 
the silence of the moon 
and the quiet of the day far from the roar of the sun. 

The silence when I hold you to my chest, 
the silence of the window above us, 
and the silence when you rise and turn away. 

And there is the silence of this morning 
which I have broken with my pen, 
a silence that had piled up all night 

like snow falling in the darkness of the house— 
the silence before I wrote a word 
and the poorer silence now."
208,The Singing Place,Lily A. Long,"Cold may lie the day,
      And bare of grace;
At night I slip away
      To the Singing Place.

A border of mist and doubt
      Before the gate,
And the Dancing Stars grow still
      As hushed I wait.
Then faint and far away
      I catch the beat
In broken rhythm and rhyme
      Of joyous feet,—
Lifting waves of sound
      That will rise and swell
(If the prying eyes of thought
      Break not the spell),
Rise and swell and retreat
      And fall and flee,
As over the edge of sleep
      They beckon me.
And I wait as the seaweed waits
      For the lifting tide;

To ask would be to awake,—
      To be denied.
I cloud my eyes in the mist
      That veils the hem,—
And then with a rush I am past,-—
      I am Theirs, and of Them!
And the pulsing chant swells up
      To touch the sky,
And the song is joy, is life,
      And the song am I!
The thunderous music peals
      Around, o'erhead-
The dead would awake to hear
      If there were dead;
But the life of the throbbing Sun
      Is in the song,
And we weave the world anew,
      And the Singing Throng
Fill every corner of space—-

Over the edge of sleep
      I bring but a trace
Of the chants that pulse and sweep
      In the Singing Place."
209,Sleep,Meghan O'Rourke,"Pawnbroker, scavenger, cheapskate,
come creeping from your pigeon-filled backrooms,
past guns and clocks and locks and cages,
past pockets emptied and coins picked from the floor;
come sweeping with the rainclouds down the river
through the brokenblack windows of factories
to avenues where movies whisk through basement projectors
and children peel up into the supplejack twilight—
there a black-eyed straight-backed drag queen
preens, fusses, fixes her hair in a shop window on Prince,
a young businessman jingles his change
and does his Travis Bickle for a long-faced friend,
there on the corner I laughed at a joke Jim made.
In the bedroom the moon is a dented spoon,
cold, getting colder, so hurry sleep,
come creep into bed, let’s get it over with;
lay me down and close my eyes
and tell me whip, tell me winnow
tell me sweet tell me skittish
tell me No tell me no such thing
tell me straw into gold tell me crept into fire
tell me lost all my money tell me hoarded, verboten,
but promise tomorrow I will be profligate,
stepping into the sun like a trophy."
210,Sloth,Yusef Komunyakaa,"If you're one of seven 
Downfalls, up in your kingdom 
Of mulberry leaves, there are men 
Betting you aren't worth a bullet, 

That your skin won't tan into a good 
Wallet. As if drugged in the womb 
& limboed in a honeyed languor, 
By the time you open your eyes 

A thousand species have lived 
& died. Born on a Sunday 
Morning, with old-world algae 
In your long hair, a goodness 

Disguised your two-toed claws 
Bright as flensing knives. In this 
Upside-down haven, you're reincarnated 
As a fallen angel trying to go home."
211,SMOKE,Philip Levine,"Can you imagine the air filled with smoke?
 It was. The city was vanishing before noon
 or was it earlier than that? I can't say because
 the light came from nowhere and went nowhere. 

This was years ago, before you were born, before
 your parents met in a bus station downtown.
 She'd come on Friday after work all the way
 from Toledo, and he'd dressed in his only suit. 

Back then we called this a date, some times
 a blind date, though they'd written back and forth
 for weeks. What actually took place is now lost.
 It's become part of the mythology of a family, 

the stories told by children around the dinner table.
 No, they aren't dead, they're just treated that way,
 as objects turned one way and then another
 to catch the light, the light overflowing with smoke. 

Go back to the beginning, you insist. Why
 is the air filled with smoke? Simple. We had work.
 Work was something that thrived on fire, that without
 fire couldn't catch its breath or hang on for life. 

We came out into the morning air, Bernie, Stash,
 Williams, and I, it was late March, a new war
 was starting up in Asia or closer to home,
 one that meant to kill us, but for a moment 

the air held still in the gray poplars and elms
 undoing their branches. I understood the moon
 for the very first time, why it came and went, why
 it wasn't there that day to greet the four of us. 

Before the bus came a small black bird settled
 on the curb, fearless or hurt, and turned its beak up
 as though questioning the day. ""A baby crow,""
 someone said. Your father knelt down on the wet cement, 

his lunchbox balanced on one knee and stared quietly
 for a long time. ""A grackle far from home,"" he said.
 One of the four of us mentioned tenderness,
 a word I wasn't used to, so it wasn't me. 

The bus must have arrived. I'm not there today.
 The windows were soiled. We swayed this way and that
 over the railroad tracks, across Woodward Avenue,
 heading west, just like the sun, hidden in smoke."
212,Snakeskin,Liz Beasley,"Clouds thin into form: a hawk 
pulling a tail of rings—beads 
of an abacus, the mathematics 
of light—a lengthening spine, 
snakeskin no longer inhabited. 
All day I'm giving a name 
for what isn't there. Yet somewhere 
we've left our likeness, the hollow 
shapes of us. Even though the snake 
has slipped into the shade, 
the shed skin, deceptively whole, 
hidden in the sun-flecked grass, 
remembers what it once held."
213,Son of Fog,Dean Young,"When the fog burns off and the air's pulverized  
diamonds and you can see beyond the islands  
of forever!—far too dramatic for me. It hurts  
something behind my eyes near the sphenoid,  
not good. I prefer fog with fog behind it,  
uninflammable fog. Then there's no competition  
for brightness, no Byron for your Shelley,  
no Juno eclisping your Athena, no big bridge  
statement about bringing unity to landmasses.  
All the thought balloons are blank. The marching  
band can't practice, even a bird's got to get  
within five feet before it can start an argument.  
Like dead flies on the sill of an abandoned  
nursery, we too are seeds in the rattle  
of mortality. A foglike baby god  
picks it up, shakes it, laughs insanely  
then goes back to playing with her feet.  
I have felt awful cold and lonely and fog  
has been blotting paper to my tears.  
My dog is fog and I don't have to scoop  
its poop with my hand in a plastic bag.  
There are sensations that begin in the world,  
the mind responding with ideas but then  
those ideas cause other sensations.  
What a mess. We stand at the edge  
of a drop that doesn't answer back,  
fog our only friend although it's hell  
on shrimpboats. There, there, says the fog.  
Where, where? You can't see a thing."
214,Song,Mark Defoe,"I make the drive, walk the corporate walk, 
To do what I must and give what I got. 
I turn the chrome knob and I fill my slot. 
I talk and I joke, a regular guy 
I input and output and rarely ask why. 

It's pasta and wine at home in my flat. 
It's voice mail and e-mail, then feed the stray cat. 
Sometimes I go out and chat up the girls. 
Some want to tango, some manage a smile. 
Some come home and have safe sex for a while. 

My sweet IRA, my 401-k, 
Let me buy tickets to games, to a play— 
I go with the gang and don't get involved. 
I fly to St. Croix and stare at the sea. 
I travel first class. No day-tripper me. 

My stocks are diverse to ride out the storm. 
I buy what is solid, hew to the norm. 
My portfolio teaches how I should vote. 
I'm cautious in style, suspicious of trend. 
When weather turns foul I always come in. 

This is my choice, my new BoBo life. 
A two-career marriage, the tension, the strife— 
It didn't last long. We parted as pals. 
She got the condo. I got the car. 
She's a savvy, cool chick. She'll go really far. 

My folks live upstate, where I misspent my youth. 
They're tight with their money and long in the tooth. 
When I visit it's hard with so little to say. 
They miss me, they claim. They worry. They pray. 
But they seem relieved when I drive away."
215,Song of the Sea to the Shore,Robert Fanning,"Unraveling velvet, wave after wave, driven  
by wind, unwinding by storm, by gravity thrown—  
however, heaving to reach you, to find you, I've striven  
undulant, erosive, blown—  

or lying flat as glass for your falling clear  
down: I can't swallow you. So why  
have I felt I've reached you—as two reflected stars,  
surfaced, lie near—as if the sky's  

close element is one in me, where starfish  
cleave to stones—if you're so far?  
I've touched you, I know, but my rush        
subsides; our meetings only leave desire's  

fleeting trace. Every place I touch you  
changes shape. Shore, lie down—  
undo. I'll fill your thirsty bones with blue.  
I'll flood your every cave and we'll be one."

THE ESSENCE OF HYPNOSIS
(Paris: LeGrande, 1902) 

The woman has agreed to swallow pins,
and here, white-robed,
stands great Dr. Charcot,

pointing to the needles in her palm. The photo
makes them gleam. The stovepipe-hatted amphitheatre strains,

heads abob for better looks. She's about
to lap them like sugar, but the Doctor's minion

stays her hand; down her dress they glitter and rain.
And now from the murmuring crowd he procures a hat,

placing it upon her lap.
 Your child is crying.
 Can you soothe him? Tenderly the hat's caressed.

To and fro she rocks it as she sings—a case
of ""simple congestive hysteria."" He is dying,

 woman, your child is dying! The tears cascade,
her shoulders twitch and tremble. Diagnosis confirmed.

SYPHILLIS: ITS DETECTION, HISTORY, AND TREATMENT—ILLUSTRATED
(Munich: Insel Verlag, 1922) 

""The shoulders twitch and tremble at the tertiary stage,
signalling generally the advent of paresis.""

Comrade Stalin tamps his pipe and struts
the carpet to the phone, having marked another passage

with red pen. Do not put him through, I said.
 I am trying to relax. The receiver's slammed down:

collectivization can wait.
He re-cracks the spine,
relights the merscham to Nietzsche gone mad,

to Schumann demented, to sepias of six noseless
Neopolitans, an aged whore whose arms are candlewax,

spirochettes that marinate the blood, x-es
and arrows to mark their swim. His pulse

crescendos and his forehead glistens,
x and asterisks—
all night the margins redden.
 
III

THE RIGHT TO KILL
(Moscow: Bezbozhnik, third ed., 1913) 

X and asterisk: shorthand all night flowing
out the stenographer's hand. Agent Shivarov:

 Why do you think we've arrested you? He cups
his face in his hands while Mandelstam fidgets, blowing

on his tea to cool it.
 Could it be your poems?
(The bulb's faint hum, the stenographer's cough.)

On the desk a bulging file, from which Shivarov
removes a smudged carbon, sliding it toward Mandelstam

along the tabletop. A recitation, please?
The hand begins to quiver as the carbon blues

his palm—
""the Kremlin mountaineer ... the thick worms
of his fingers ... executions on his tongue like berries.""

 Do you recognize yourself as guilty of composing tracts
of counter-revolutionary nature? And the blue hand shakes.
 
IV

IS RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD POSSIBLE?
(London: Theosophy International, 1921) 

Against the table the cadaver thrashes: its blue arms quiver—
a little. More voltage to the genitals.

and a kind of erection is achieved, which Dr. Lysenko
duly notes, yet Lazarus does not stir,

exactly.
One week to Comrade Stalin's visit,
and the demonstrations must impress:

too much voltage and the corpses combust,
too little and the limbs remain inert

as noodles. Notes scratched on his clipboard, the doctor
scowls to his humpbacked assistant, who hits

the switch.
And Lazarus sizzles—flames emit
from the electroded temples. The good doctor swears

and flails his arms, as the corpse performs
its own suttee. The corpse has the final word.
 
V

RITUAL MURDER AMONG THE JEWS
(St. Petersburg: Grani Vot, 1910) 

 Do not wait until we force you: we will have the final say.
Begin your confession.
Precise as a slide rule

and always natural as the smell of dill—
interrogation, too, is art. Babel sways

upon his stool, his neck goes limp. The aesthetics
of confession must be formalist:

The Trotskyist Babel will weep and stutter but list
in the end his cohort spies.
Yet first he must wake.

Cold water to the face, a truncheon to the legs
and the writer's block is over. The singing

commences with the truncheon's sting,
the singing and the singing and the singing—

its own dark Kaddish, its own crematorium smoke.
 The verdict is final, the case is closed.
 
VI

PRACTICAL VERSIFICATION
(Moscow: Nova Mysl, 1908) 

Should the couplets be open or should they be closed?
The day requires signatures, decrees.

He longs for verse, but must speak in prose.
All the endless signatures.
A photo shoot: he poses

with pen in hand, the Pravda newsman on his knees.
Should the couplets be open or should they be closed?

Signatures of every sort, the pace never slows.
The State revised, rewritten endlessly.

He hungers for verse but lives by prose,
Redrafted, retouched. The coffins set in rows

like Red Square parades, marching to infinity.
Should the couplets be open
or should they be closed?

Late in the Kremlin, his desk lamp glows.
So much to excise, he's up until three.

(O to live by verse instead of prose.)
The drafts soar upward. On his desk the pile grows

skyscraper high, Babel tower and gallows tree.
O sentence in verse, O sentence in prose.

Should the couplets be open or should they be closed?
 
VII

PROPOSAL FOR REVISION OF THE FIRST SOVIET ENCYCLOPEDIA
(Moscow: Kommunisticheskoy Partii, 1926) 

The people can be made to swallow anything.
For example Comrade Yezhov,
Special Marshal

of the Secret Police, has been shot. He will
now require closure, require editing.

His service to the party, his Trotskyite past,
all must now be excised, even his birth

converted to white space.
And first
his face must pentimento down to nothingness.

No longer can he pose with Comrade Stalin
admiring the Moscow-Volga Canal. Now he is water.

No longer at His right in parades at Red Square.
Now he is air, is brickwork on the viewing stand.

And now the past itself is air, is water, and finally fire,
whitening to ash.
 In his fat fingers its pages flare."
217,The Stars Are,Samuel Menashe,"The stars are   
Although I do not sing   
About them—   
The sky and the trees   
Are indifferent   
To whom they please   
The rose is unmoved   
By my nose   
And the garland in your hair   
Although your eyes be lakes, dies   

Why sigh for a star   
Better bay at the moon   
Better bay at the moon . . .   
Oh moon, moon, moon"
218,Stationed,Albert Goldbarth,"It's the other ones, who soon enough return  
to being happy after the funeral, that are nearest  
to their own deaths—in their gaiety  
and everyday distraction, they're so open  

and unguarded . . . anything could enter them;  
could claim them. It's the ones who weep  
incessantly that are saved for now, the ones  
who have taken a little of it  

into their systems: this is how  
inoculation works. And sorrow is difficult,  
a job: it requires time to complete.  
And the tears?—the salt  

of the folk saying,  
that gets sprinkled over the tail feathers  
and keeps a bird from flying;  
keeps it stationed in this world."
219,Staying Power,Jeanne Murray Walker,"In appreciation of Maxim Gorky at the International Convention of Atheists, 1929

Like Gorky, I sometimes follow my doubts
outside to the yard and question the sky,
longing to have the fight settled, thinking
I can't go on like this, and finally I say

all right, it is improbable, all right, there
is no God. And then as if I'm focusing
a magnifying glass on dry leaves, God blazes up.
It's the attention, maybe, to what isn't there

that makes the emptiness flare like a forest fire
until I have to spend the afternoon dragging
the hose to put the smoldering thing out.
Even on an ordinary day when a friend calls,

tells me they've found melanoma,
complains that the hospital is cold, I say God.
God, I say as my heart turns inside out.
Pick up any language by the scruff of its neck,

wipe its face, set it down on the lawn,
and I bet it will toddle right into the godfire
again, which—though they say it doesn't
exist—can send you straight to the burn unit.

Oh, we have only so many words to think with.
Say God's not fire, say anything, say God's
a phone, maybe. You know you didn't order a phone,
but there it is. It rings. You don't know who it could be.

You don't want to talk, so you pull out
the plug. It rings. You smash it with a hammer
till it bleeds springs and coils and clobbery
metal bits. It rings again. You pick it up

and a voice you love whispers hello."
220,Subject to Change,Marilyn L. Taylor,"A reflection on my students

They are so beautiful, and so very young 
they seem almost to glitter with perfection, 
these creatures that I briefly move among. 

I never get to stay with them for long, 
but even so, I view them with affection: 
they are so beautiful, and so very young. 

Poised or clumsy, placid or high-strung, 
they're expert in the art of  introspection, 
these creatures that I briefly move among— 

And if their words don't quite trip  off the tongue 
consistently, with just the right inflection, 
they remain beautiful. And very young. 

Still, I have to tell myself it's  wrong 
to think of them as anything but fiction, 
these creatures that I briefly move  among— 

Because, like me, they're traveling  headlong 
in that familiar, vertical direction 
that coarsens beautiful, blackmails young— 
the two delusions we all move among."
221,Suburban Pastoral,Dave Lucas,"Twilight folds over houses on our street;  
its hazy gold is gilding our front lawns,  
delineating asphalt and concrete  
driveways with shadows. Evening is coming on,  
quietly, like a second drink, the beers  
men hold while rising from their plastic chairs  
to stand above their sprinklers, and approve.  

Soon the fireflies will rise in lucent droves—  
for now, however, everything seems content  
to settle into archetypal grooves:  
the toddler's portraits chalked out on cement,  
mothers in windows, finishing the dishes.  
Chuck Connelly's cigarette has burned to ashes;  
he talks politics to Roger in the drive.  

""It's all someone can do just to survive,""  
he says, and nods—both nod—and pops another  
beer from the cooler. ""No rain. Would you believe—""  
says Chuck, checking the paper for the weather.  
At least a man can keep his yard in shape.  
Somewhere beyond this plotted cityscape  
their sons drive back and forth in borrowed cars:  

how small their city seems now, and how far  
away they feel from last year, when they rode  
their bikes to other neighborhoods, to score  
a smoke or cop a feel in some girl's bed.  
They tune the radio to this summer's song  
and cruise into the yet-to-exhale lung  
of August night. Nothing to do but this.  

These are the times they'd never dream they'll miss—  
the hour spent chasing a party long burned out,  
graphic imagined intercourse with Denise.  
This is all they can even think about,  
and thankfully, since what good would it do  
to choke on madeleines of  temps perdu  
when so much time is set aside for that?  

Not that their fathers weaken with regret  
as nighttime settles in—no, their wives  
are on the phone, the cooler has Labatt  
to spare; at nine the Giants play the Braves.  
There may be something to romanticize  
about their own first cars, the truths and lies  
they told their friends about some summer fling,  

but what good is it now, when anything  
recalled is two parts true and one part false?  
When no one can remember just who sang  
that song that everybody loved? What else?  
It doesn't come to mind. The sprinkler spits  
in metronome; they're out of cigarettes.  
Roger folds up his chair, calls it a day.  

The stars come out in cosmic disarray,  
and windows flash with television blues.  
The husbands come to bed, nothing to say  
but  'night . Two hours late—with some excuse—  
their sons come home, too full of songs and girls  
to notice dew perfect its muted pearls  
or countless crickets singing for a mate."
222,Subway Seethe,J. Allyn Rosser,"What could have been the big to-do
that caused him to push me aside
on that platform? Was a woman who knew
there must be some good even inside
an ass like him on board that train?
Charity? Frances? His last chance
in a ratty string of last chances? Jane?
Surely in all of us is some good.
Better love thy neighbor, buddy,
lest she shove back. Maybe I should.
It's probably just a cruddy
downtown interview leading to
some cheap-tie, careerist, dull
cul-de-sac he's speeding to.
Can he catch up with his soul?
Really, what was the freaking crisis?
Did he need to know before me
if the lights searching the crowd's eyes
were those of our train, or maybe
the train of who he might have been,
the person his own-heart-numbing,
me-shoving anxiety about being
prevents him from ever becoming?
How has his thoughtlessness defiled
who I was before he shoved me?
How might I be smiling now if he'd smiled,
hanging back, as though he might have loved me?"
223,Sugar Dada,J. Allyn Rosser,"Go home. It's never what you think it is,
The kiss, the diamond, the slamdance pulse in the wrist.
Nothing is true, my dear, not even this

Rumor of passion you'll doubtless insist
On perceiving in my glance. Please just
Go. Home is never what you think it is.

Meaning lies in meaning's absence. The mist
Is always almost just about to lift.
Nothing is truer. Dear, not even this

Candle can explain its searing twist
Of flame mounted on cool amethyst.
Go on home—not where you think it is,

But where you would expect its comfort least,
In still-black stars our century will miss
Seeing. Nothingness is not as true as this

Faith we grind up with denial: grist
To the midnight mill; morning's catalyst.
Come, let's go home, wherever you think it is.
Nothing is true, my dear. Not even this."
224,Suitcase Song,Albert Goldbarth,"John-O was given a key to the apartment. The deal
was this: if Phil died suddenly, and John-O heard,
he would rush on over, enter the apartment, leave
unseen with Phil’s brown suitcase, and secretly pitch it
into the mounded deeps of the city dump.
Simply, there were things that Phil didn’t want
to hurt his family with. Do you have yours?
I have mine. The brown suitcase. Sasha’s sister,
on her deathbed—dinky, frail, just a mild
skim-milk trickle of a hospice patient—
tensed, sat up, and unloosed
such confessional invective that it seemed the walls
and the sheets would have to be splattered in shit,
her cancer having acted with the harsh, disbursing
force of a tornado on the brown and hard-shelled
suitcase in her electrochemical memory webs.
Is yours secure? from love? from sodium pentathol?
Last year, when a tornado hit our fringe
of downtown businesses, the air was alive for counties around
with the downward dance of naked canceled checks,
handwritten notes, hotel receipts, e-mail transcripts,
smeary Polaroids, a swirl of lacy underwisps
that jellyfished the skies, and from The G-Spot Shoppe
a rain of plastic pleasure aids, of which one prime example
pierced a cow between the eyes and struck her dead.

Maybe AIDS—I wasn’t sure. But he was dying,
 that was sure: as dry as a stick of human chalk,
and making the terrible scritch-sound of a stick of chalk,
in his throat, in the community air, in the room
across from Sasha’s sister. Something . . . hidden
in the trace of rundown aura still around him
as we chatted there one morning . . . a tv? a sissyboy tv?
I wasn’t sure, but it was obvious
his life-chalk held a story not yet written,
not confessed yet
for this storyniverous planet.
And when I remembered my mother’s own
last days . . . the way a person is a narrative,
the strength of which is either
revelation or withholding. It was summer, and the garden
at the nursing home was fat with summer’s pleasures:
flowered mounds like reefs of coral,
bees as globular as whole yolks.
In her room, my mother disappeared a breath
at a time, and everything else was only a kind of scenery for that.
The wink of pollen in the light. The birds. Their feather-lice.
The bursting spores. Those opened-up
cicada husks abandoned on the patio
—the small, brown, unlocked luggage
that’s completed its work in this world."
225,The Sun,Dan Chiasson,"There is one mind in all of us, one soul, 
   who parches the soil in some nations 

but in others hides perpetually behind a veil; 
   he spills light everywhere, here he spilled 

some on my tie, but it dried before dinner ended. 
   He is in charge of darkness also, also 

in charge of crime, in charge of the imagination. 
   People fucking do so by flicking him 

off and on, off and on, with their eyelids 
   as they ascertain their love's sincerity. 

He makes the stars disappear, but he makes 
   small stars everywhere, on the hoods of cars, 

in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes 
   of sighing lovers bored with one another. 

Onto the surface of the world he stamps 
   all plants and animals. They are not gods 

but it is he who made us worshippers of every  
   bramble toad, black chive we find. 

In Idaho there is a desert cricket that makes 
   a clock-like tick-tick when he flies, but he 

is not a god. The only god is the sun, 
   our mind, master of all crickets and clocks."
226,Swifts,Gerald Stern,"Bing Crosby died in Spain
 while playing golf with Franco
 but who could care less, and at this
 writing only a few of
 my dear ones are gone—ah I
 could make a sad list—the swifts,
 as if to prove a point,
 fly into the light and make
 a mockery out of our darkness.
 They scream for food but in
 the world of shadows they only
 make a quick motion; I have
 studied them—the whiter
 the wall is—the barer the bulb—
 the more they scream, the more
 they dip down. I have made
 my two hands into a shape
 and I have darkened the wall
 to see what it looks like—I have
 shortened my two broken fingers
 to make the small tail and twisted
 the knuckles sideways so when
 they come in to eat one shadow
 overtakes the other, that way
 I can live in the darkness
 with Franco's poisonous head
 and Crosby's ears, who fainted,
 a thousand to one, behind a
 number two club, though no swift
 died for him, well, for them,
 digging for clubs. I watch the
 birds every night; they fly
 in a great circle, much larger
 than what I can see, their dipping
 is what I dreaded in front of
 my plain white wall—I say it
 for the nine hundred Americans
 who died in Spain. I thought
 I'd have to wait forever
 to do them a tiny justice
 and listen to their songs
 and die a little from the foolhardy
 mournful words, flying down
 one air current or another
 and doing the sides of buildings
 and tops of trees, the low-lying
 straggling dogwood, the full-bodied
 huge red maple, my dear ones."

TO MOZART

What junipers are these, inlaid 
   With flame of the pomegranate tree? 
The god of gardens must have made 
   This still unrumored place for thee 
To rest from immortality, 
   And dream within the splendid shade 
Some more elusive symphony 
   Than orchestra has ever played. 

I In A major 
Poco sosteniao 

The laying tide of inarticulate air 
Breaks here in flowers as the sea in foam, 
But with no satin lisp of failing wave: 
The odor-laden winds are very still. 
An unimagined music here exhales 
In upcurled petal, dreamy bud half-furled, 
And variations of thin vivid leaf: 
Symphonic beauty that some god forgot. 
If form could waken into lyric sound, 
This flock of irises like poising birds 
Would feel song at their slender feathered throats, 
And pour into a grey-winged aria 
Their wrinkled silver fingermarked with pearl; 
That flight of ivory roses high along 
The airy azure of the larkspur spires 
Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales 
With tool-evasive rapture, phrase on phrase. 
Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash, 
And the black cypress like a deep bassoon 
Would hum a clouded amber melody. 

But all across the trudging ragged chords 
That are the tangled grasses in the heat, 
The mariposa lilies fluttering 
Like trills upon some archangelic flute, 

The roses and carnations and divine 
Small violets that voice the vanished god, 
There is a lure of passion-poignant tone 
Not flower-of-pomegranate—that finds the heart 
As stubborn oboes do—can breathe in air, 
Nor poppies, nor keen lime, nor orange-bloom. 

What zone of wonder in the ardent dusk 
Of trees that yearn and cannot understand, 
Vibrates as to the golden shepherd horn 
That stirs some great adagio with its cry 
And will not let it rest? 
                                       0 tender trees, 
Your orchid, like a shepherdess of dreams, 
Calls home her whitest dream from following 
Elusive laughter of the unmindful god! 

Vivace 

The iris people dance 
Like any nimble faun: 
To rhythmic radiance 
They foot it in the dawn. 
They dance and have no need 
Of crystal-dripping flute 
Or chuckling river-reed,— 
Their music hovers mute. 
The dawn-lights flutter by 
All noiseless, but they know! 

Such children of the sky 
Can hear the darkness go. 
But does the morning play 
Whatever they demand— 
Or amber-barred bourré
Or silver saraband? 

THE POOL

II. In A minor 
Allegretto 

Cool-hearted dim familiar of the doves, 
   Thou coiled sweet water where they come to tell 
Their mellow legends and rehearse their loves, 
   As what in April or in June befell 
 of, —friend of Dryades 
   Who lean to see where flower should be set 
      To star the dusk of wreathed ivy braids, 
         They have not left thy trees, 
   Nor do tired fauns thy crystal kiss forget, 
      Nor forest—nymphs astray from distant glades. 

Thou feelest with delight their showery feet 
   Along thy mossy margin myrtle-starred, 
And thine the heart of wildness quick to beat 
   At imprint of shy hoof upon thy sward: 
Yet who could know thee wild who art so cool, 
   So heavenly—minded, templed in thy grove 
      Of plumy cedar, larch and juniper? 
         O strange ecstatic Pool, 
What unknown country art thou dreaming of, 
   Or temple than this garden lovelier? 

Who made thy sky the silver side of leaves, 
   And poised its orchid like a swan—white moon 
Whose disc of perfect pallor half deceives 
   The mirror of thy limpid green lagoon, 
He loveth well thy ripple-feathered moods, 
   Thy whims at dusk, thy rainbow look at dawn! 
      Dream thou no more of vales Olympian: 
         Where pale Olympus broods 
   There were no orchid white as moon or swan, 
   No sky of leaves, no garden—haunting Pan! 

THE BIRDS

Ill In F major 
Presto 

I keep a frequent tryst 
With whirr and shower of wings: 
Some inward melodist 
Interpreting all things 
Appoints the place, the hours. 
Dazzle and sense of flowers, 
Though not the least leaf stir, 
May mean a tanager: 
How rich the silence is until he sings! 

The smoke-tree’s cloudy white 
Has fire within its breast. 
What winged mere delight 
There hides as in a nest 
And fashions of its flame 
Music without a name? 
So might an opal sing 
If given thrilling wing, 
And voice for lyric wildness unexpressed. 

In grassy dimness thatched 
With tangled growing things, 
A troubadour rose-patched, 
With velvet-shadowed wings, 
Seeks a sustaining fly. 
Who else unseen goes by 
Quick-pattering through the hush? 
Some twilight-footed thrush 
Or finch intent on small adventurings? 

I have no time for gloom, 
For gloom what time have I? 
The orange is in bloom; 
Emerald parrots fly 
Out of the cypress-dusk; 
Morning is strange with musk. 
The wild canary now 
Jewels the lemon-bough, 
And mocking-birds laugh in the rose’s room. 

THE ORANGE TREE

In D Major 
Presto meno assai 

The blossom-powdered orange tree, 
   For all her royal speechlessness, 
Out of a heart of ecstasy 
   Is singing, singing, none the less! 

Light as a springing fountain, she 
   Is spray above the wind-sleek turf: 
Dream-daughter of the moon’s white sea 
   And sister to its showered surf! 

TO THE MOON

IV In A major 
Allegro con brio 

Moon that shone on Babylon, 
Searching out the gardens there, 
Could you find a fairer one 
Than this garden, anywhere? 
Did Damascus at her best 
Hide such beauty in her breast? 

When you flood with creamy light 
Vines that net the sombre pine, 
Turn the shadowed iris white, 
Summon cactus stars to shine, 
Do you free in silvered air 
Wistful spirits everywhere? 

Here they linger, there they pass, 
And forget their native heaven: 
Flit along the dewy grass 
Rare Vittoria, Sappho, even! 
And the hushed magnolia burns 
Incense in her gleaming urns. 

When the nightingale demands 
Word with Keats who answers him, 
Shakespeare listens—understands— 
Mindful of the cherubim; 
And the South Wind dreads to know 
Mozart gone as seraphs go. 

Moon of poets dead and gone, 
Moon to gods of music dear, 
Gardens they have looked upon 
Let them re-discover here: 
Rest—and dream a little space 
Of some heart-remembered place!"
228,Tea-Strainer,Joyelle McSweeney,"Leaf-keep, un-sibyl; if the soul 
 Has the weight of a swallow, what less 
 Has the weight of a sip? You equal 
 This riddle, unposed in your dish 
 As a hand at rest in a lap. Held to, 
 You hold back what can't be 
 Prevented, what's no more palatable 
 For that: the unfine; formerly, our future."
229,Tenderness and Rot,Kay Ryan,"Tenderness and rot   
share a border.   
And rot is an   
aggressive neighbor   
whose iridescence   
keeps creeping over.   

No lessons   
can be drawn   
from this however.   

One is not   
two countries.   
One is not meat   
corrupting.   

It is important   
to stay sweet   
and loving."
230,That Child,David Wagoner,"That child was dangerous. That just-born 
    Newly washed and silent baby 
         Wrapped in deerskin and held warm 
Against the side of its mother could understand 
    The language of birds and animals 
         Even when asleep. It knew why Bluejay 
Was scolding the bushes, what Hawk was explaining 
   To the wind on the cliffside, what Bittern had found out 
         While standing alone in marsh grass. It knew 
What the screams of Fox and the whistling of Otter 
    Were telling the forest. That child knew 
         The language of Fire 
As it gnawed at sticks like Beaver 
    And what Water said all day and all night 
         At the creek's mouth. As its small fingers 
Closed around Stone, it held what Stone was saying. 
    It knew what Bear Mother whispered to herself 
         Under the snow. It could not tell 
Anyone what it knew. It would laugh 
    Or cry out or startle or suddenly stare 
         At nothing, but had no way 
To repeat what it was hearing, what it wanted most 
    Not to remember. It had no way to know 
         Why it would fall under a spell 
And lie still as if not breathing, 
    Having grown afraid 
         Of what it could understand. That child would learn 
To sit and crawl and stand and begin 
    Putting one foot forward and following it 
         With the other, would learn to put one word 
It could barely remember slightly ahead 
    Of the other and then walk and speak 
         And finally run and chatter, 
And all the Tillamook would know that child 
    Had forgotten everything and at last could listen 
         Only to people and was safe now."
231,Then Too There Is This,J. Allyn Rosser,"joy in the day's being done, however   
clumsily, and in the ticked-off lists,   
the packages nestling together,   
no one home waiting for dinner, for   
you, no one impatient for your touch   
or kind words to salve what nightly   
rises like heartburn, the ghost-lump feeling   
that one is really as alone as one had feared.   
One isn't, not really. Not really. Joy   
to see over the strip mall darkening   
right on schedule a neon-proof pink   
sunset flaring like the roof of a cat's mouth,   
cleanly ribbed, the clouds laddering up   
and lit as if by a match struck somewhere   
in the throat much deeper down."
232,Thinking about the Enemy,J. P. White,"In the beginning we could hear their swords cutting jewels 
From the protected orchard while our children heard fine teeth 
Dragging along empty granary floors. Between us and them 
Stands the great wound, swallowing all tears, all voices. 

Transfixed or transformed by this pain? We never know because 
Who can slip through the gate without throwing a shadow 
Toward both the past and present? Fire, flood, famine— 
All we've wished upon them a thousand times, still they inch 

Back and taunt us with their persistence. We track them down 
To a quick end. More come. And the old memories grow new. 
The future seems already written with a pen of iron. The book 
Unreadable, immense. The enemy has become our masterpiece."
233,Thought,Thomas Pfau,"To George Herbert

Aspiration's breath, millennial trance, 
two-pointed ladder propped in a void; 
busy buzzard claws, verbs on a leash, 
slow blush of brain damage on a plate. 

Stunned journey of dust. A holey sock. 
Grind of an afternoon's axles, abandoned 
juggernaut in a field; inhabited interval 
with a pencil stub, curved strips of silence: 

postbox for the inner ear. Tarantula's footstep, 
a weight of light: inadvertent sky in the skull. 
Wishbone couture: promiscuous secret, 

peepshow in the street. Paraphrase of planets. 
Ocean in a tablespoon. Ordinary in the ordinary: 
nothing come of anything, matter unpossessed."
234,Three Poets,Robert West,"1. THE PLAGIARIST   

Careless of his debts, he never credits   
submissions to the magazine he edits.   

2. THE TAXIDERMIST   

Her father's dead at last, the lout—   
but now he's all she writes about.   

3. THE ASSASSIN   

His verse means less to the world of letters   
than the bad reviews he gives his betters."
235,To a Greek Marble,Richard Aldington,"Pótuia, pótuia  
White grave goddess,  
Pity my sadness,  
O silence of Paros. 

I am not of these about thy feet,  
These garments and decorum;  
I am thy brother,  
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,  
And thou hearest me not. 

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes  
Of our loves in Phrygia,  
The far ecstasy of burning noons  
When the fragile pipes  
Ceased in the cypress shade,  
And the brown fingers of the shepherd  
Moved over slim shoulders;  
And only the cicada sang. 

I have told thee of the hills 
And the lisp of reeds 
And the sun upon thy breasts, 

And thou hearest me not,  
Pótuia, pótuia 
Thou hearest me not."
236,To Judgment: An Assay,Jane Hirshfield,"You change a life
as eating an artichoke changes the taste
of whatever is eaten after.
Yet you are not an artichoke, not a piano or cat—
not objectively present at all—
and what of you a cat possesses is essential but narrow:
to know if the distance between two things can be leapt.
The piano, that good servant,
has none of you in her at all, she lends herself
to what asks; this has been my ambition as well.
Yet a person who has you is like an iron spigot
whose water comes from far-off mountain springs.
Inexhaustible, your confident pronouncements flow,
coldly delicious.
For if judgment hurts the teeth, it doesn’t mind,
not judgment. Teeth pass. Pain passes.
Judgment decrees what remains—
the serene judgments of evolution or the judgment
of a boy-king entering Persia: “Burn it,” he says,
and it burns. And if a small tear swells the corner
of one eye, it is only the smoke, it is no more to him than a beetle
fleeing the flames of the village with her six-legged children.
The biologist Haldane—in one of his tenderer moments—
judged beetles especially loved by God,
“because He had made so many.” For judgment can be tender:
I have seen you carry a fate to its end as softly as a retriever
carries the quail. Yet however much
I admire you at such moments, I cannot love you:
you are too much in me, weighing without pity your own worth.
When I have erased you from me entirely,
disrobed of your measuring adjectives,
stripped from my shoulders and hips each of your nouns,
when the world is horsefly, coal barge, and dawn the color of winter butter—
not beautiful, not cold, only the color of butter—
then perhaps I will love you. Helpless to not.
As a newborn wolf is helpless: no choice but hunt the wolf milk,
find it sweet."
237,To Luck,W. S. Merwin,"In the cards and at the bend in the road  
we never saw you  
in the womb and in the crossfire  
in the numbers  
whatever you had your hand in  
which was everything  
we were told never to put  
our faith in you  
to bow to you humbly after all  
because in the end there was nothing  
else we could do  
but not to believe in you  

still we might coax you with pebbles  
kept warm in the hand  
or coins or the relics  
of vanished animals  
observances rituals  
not binding upon you  
who make no promises  
we might do such things only  
not to neglect you  
and risk your disfavor  
oh you who are never the same  
who are secret as the day when it comes  
you whom we explain  
as often as we can  
without understanding"
238,To My Father's Business,Kenneth Koch,"Leo bends over his desk    
Gazing at a memorandum    
While Stuart stands beside him    
With a smile, saying,    
""Leo, the order for those desks    
Came in today    
From Youngstown Needle and Thread!""    
C. Loth Inc., there you are    
Like Balboa the conqueror    
Of those who want to buy office furniture    
Or bar fixtures    
In nineteen forty in Cincinnati, Ohio!    
Secretaries pound out    
Invoices on antique typewriters—    
Dactyllographs    
And fingernail biters.    
I am sitting on a desk    
Looking at my daddy    
Who is proud of but feels unsure about    
Some aspects of his little laddie.    
I will go on to explore    
Deep and/or nonsensical themes    
While my father's on the dark hardwood floor    
Hit by a couple of Ohio sunbeams.    
Kenny, he says, some day you'll work in the store.    
But I felt ""never more"" or ""never ever""    
Harvard was far away    
World War Two was distant    
Psychoanalysis was extremely expensive    
All of these saved me from you.    
C. Loth you made my father happy    
I saw his face shining    
He laughed a lot, working in you    
He said to Miss Ritter    
His secretary    
""Ritt, this is my boy, Kenny!""    
""Hello there Kenny,"" she said    
My heart in an uproar    
I loved you but couldn't think    
Of staying with you    
I can see the virtues now    
That could come from being in you    
A sense of balance    
Compromise and acceptance—    
Not isolated moments of brilliance    
Like a girl without a shoe,    
But someone that you    
Care for every day—    
Need for customers and the economy    
Don't go away.    
There were little pamphlets    
Distributed in you    
About success in business    
Each about eight to twelve pages long    
One whole series of them    
All ended with the words    
""P.S. He got the job""    
One a story about a boy who said,    
""I swept up the street, Sir,    
Before you got up."" Or    
""There were five hundred extra    catalogues    
So I took them to people in the city who have a dog""—    
P.S. He got the job.    
I didn't get the job    
I didn't think that I could do the job    
I thought I might go crazy in the job    
Staying in you    
You whom I could love    
But not be part of    
The secretaries clicked    
Their Smith Coronas closed at five p.m.    
And took the streetcars to Kentucky then    
And I left too."
239,To One Unknown,Helen Dudley,"I have seen the proudest stars
That wander on through space,
Even the sun and moon,
But not your face.

I have heard the violin,
The winds and waves rejoice
in endless minstrelsy,
Yet not your voice.

I have touched the trillium,
Pale flower of the land,
Coral, anemone,
And not your hand.

I have kissed the shining feet
Of Twilight lover-wise,
Opened the gates of Dawn—
Oh not your eyes!

I have dreamed unwonted things,
Visions that witches brew,
Spoken with images,
Never with you."
240,To the Blank Spaces,W. S. Merwin,"For longer than by now I can believe 
I assumed that you had nothing to do 
with each other I thought you had arrived 
            whenever that had been 

more solitary than single snowflakes 
with no acquaintance or understanding 
running among you guiding your footsteps 
            somewhere ahead of me 

in your own time oh white lakes on the maps 
that I copied and gaps on the paper 
for the names that were to appear in them 
            sometimes a doorway or 

window sometimes an eye sometimes waking 
without knowing the place in the whole night 
I might have guessed from the order in which 
            you turned up before me 

and from the way I kept looking at you 
as though I recognized something in you 
that you were all words out of one language 
            tracks of the same creature"
241,To the Consolations of Philosophy,W. S. Merwin,"Thank you but 
not just at the moment 

I know you will say 
I have said that before 
I know you have been 
there all along somewhere 
in another time zone 

I studied once 
those beautiful instructions 
when I was young and 
far from here 
they seemed distant then 
they seem distant now 
from everything I remember 

I hope they stayed with you 
when the noose started to tighten 
and you could say no more 
and after wisdom 
and the days of iron 
the eyes started from your head 

I know the words 
must have been set down 
partly for yourself 
unjustly condemned after 
a good life 

I know the design 
of the world is beyond 
our comprehension 
thank you 
but grief is selfish and in 
the present when 
the stars do not seem to move 
I was not listening 

I know it is not 
sensible to expect 
fortune to grant her 
gifts forever 
I know"
242,To the Light of September,W. S. Merwin,"When you are already here 
you appear to be only 
a name that tells of you 
whether you are present or not 

and for now it seems as though 
you are still summer 
still the high familiar 
endless summer 
yet with a glint 
of bronze in the chill mornings 
and the late yellow petals 
of the mullein fluttering 
on the stalks that lean 
over their broken 
shadows across the cracked ground 

but they all know 
that you have come 
the seed heads of the sage 
the whispering birds 
with nowhere to hide you 
to keep you for later 

you 
who fly with them 

you who are neither 
before nor after 
you who arrive 
with blue plums 
that have fallen through the night 

perfect in the dew"
243,"To Whistler, American",Ezra Pound,"On the loan exhibit of his paintings at the Tate Gallery.

You also, our first great,
Had tried all ways;
Tested and pried and worked in many fashions,
And this much gives me heart to play the game.

Here is a part that's slight, and part gone wrong,
And much of little moment, and some few
Perfect as Dürer!

""In the Studio"" and these two portraits,* if I had my choice!
And then these sketches in the mood of Greece?

You had your searches, your uncertainties,
And this is good to know—for us, I mean,
Who bear the brunt of our America
And try to wrench her impulse into art.

You were not always sure, not always set
To hiding night or tuning ""symphonies"";
Had not one style from birth, but tried and pried
And stretched and tampered with the media.

You and Abe Lincoln from that mass of dolts
Show us there's chance at least of winning through.

244,Today,Billy Collins,"If ever there were a spring day so perfect,
so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze

that it made you want to throw
open all the windows in the house

and unlatch the door to the canary's cage,
indeed, rip the little door from its jamb,

a day when the cool brick paths
and the garden bursting with peonies

seemed so etched in sunlight
that you felt like taking

a hammer to the glass paperweight
on the living room end table,

releasing the inhabitants
from their snow-covered cottage

so they could walk out,
holding hands and squinting

into this larger dome of blue and white,
well, today is just that kind of day."
245,Torcello,Catherine Sasanov,"Offshore, the Apocalypse  
stays contained  
to one island and its church.  

Venice's ruler's out wedding  
himself to the ocean  

while I'm ankle deep  
in the Adriatic,  
eyes raised to a book  

unencumbered by words: A Bible  
that reads from East to West. Guidebooks  
want only  

to see it as ceiling—the Basilica  
San Marco,  

where Christ's hands open on wounds  
embedded with rubies, and priests  

hold back the sea with brooms.  
I'm taking on incense,  

bowing at altars dragged out  
of Constantinople,  
sloshing across marble  
sacked from Jerusalem.  

Offshore, the sea's a bride bought  
with a fist full of diamonds  
the Doge throws into the deep— 

a sign of his true and perpetual dominion.  

Then why does walking into this church  
mean stepping into the ocean?  
The sea is a dog— 
Priests throw in bones just to placate it.  

The year's nearly 2000,  
but the millennium already hit once  

on the island Torcello,  
a kind of plague the Venetians contained.  
999 years,  

and the dead still crawl from dirt  
towards their radiant bodies,  
they still gather up  

missing limbs: arms, legs, hands  
sharks and beasts keep regurgitating.  

We do what we know— 
But Christ never wanted to manage  
resurrections in Venice.  

Underdressed in the flesh  
from dead civilizations,  
he moves among us in Byzantine skin.  

I'm getting close to this God  
worshiped only by tourists.  

He picks at the wounds  
on his crucified body, the injury  
scabbed over with jewels."
246,Toth Farry,Sharon Olds,"In the back of the charm-box, in a sack, the baby    
canines and incisors are mostly chaff,  
by now, split kernels and acicular down, no  
whole utensils left: half  
an adz; half a shovel, in its broken  
handle a marrow well of the will  
to dig and bite. And the enamel hems  
are sharp as shell-tools, and the colors go from  
salt, to bone, to pee on snow, to  
sun on pond-ice embedded with twigs  
and chipped-off skate-blade. One cuspid  
is like the tail of an ivory chough  
on my grandmother's what-not in a gravure on my mother's  
bureau in my father's house in my head,  
I think it's our daughter's, but the dime Hermes  
mingled the deciduals of our girl and boy, safe-  
keeping them together with the note that says  
Dear Toth Farry, Plees Giv Me  
A Bag of Moany. I pore over the shards,  
a skeleton-lover—but who could throw out  
these short pints of osseus breastmilk,  
or the wisdom, with its charnel underside,  
and its dome, smooth and experienced,  
ground in anger, rinsed in silver  
when the mouth waters. From above, its knurls  
are a cusp-ring of mountain tops  
around an amber crevasse, where in high  
summer the summit wildflowers open  
for a day—Crown Buttercup, Alpine Flames,  
Shooting-Star, Rosy Fairy Lantern,  
Cream Sacs, Sugar Scoop."
247,Touch,Trevor West Knapp,"We speak of the pain of childbirth, referring, 
of course, to the mother, but what is pain 
to the mother, the one through whose body 
the course unwinds? She understands already 
what kind of world she must return to, 
how it daily hones its many edges 
against human skin, unlike the child whose 
untried limbs inch toward it, pressing now 
so firmly against her he feels for the first time 
the pinch of bone against bone and is seared 
by the friction. Isn't he the one 
on whom the real burden falls, the one 
to whom resilience means nothing yet? His 
tender skin like a small measure of cloth 
unfolding before the blade under which 
he will, for a lifetime, bruise 
and heal: Crush of the long descent, grip 
of the steadying hands, brush of breath 
against cheek, even the constant barrage 
of the microscopic, the tiny plink-plink 
of the dust motes knocking against him 
before custom makes him numb to it. No wonder 
the startled mouth cries out, 
each pore suddenly hungry 
in the withering, nourishing light."
248,"Town Hall, Fifteenth Arrondissement (tr. by John Ashbery)",Pierre Martory,"You should have heard the soldiers’ feet
wounding the swirls that the accordion waltz
left on the pavement like a mower’s swath
once the parade had passed
you should have kissed the soldiers’ feet
pulled out of their boots and licked the ankles
and climbed as far as the khaki
seven and a half millimeters thick would allow
you should have shaken their belly like a carpet
it was grand illusion day
when they escape their deep knowledge
and pretend to look for handsome successors
but it would be better to look for the heart
and put an alarm clock in its place
that could play reveille like a puppet
but wouldn’t serve coffee in bed
you should have rummaged under their false teeth
to hunt for hidden diamonds with lively fingers
hunt for them everywhere not find them
even in the creases of their nakedness.
Joy of being a child of the sovereign people
of lending a hand to institutions
and seeing one’s name inscribed on the slate
of urinals in letters of coal tar
for a single flag that one has become
flapping its boredom at the angles of two streets
that the wind stirs unless it’s first
the wind of trumpets all love to the winds"
249,The Tragedy of Hats,Clarinda Harriss,"is that you can never see the one you're wearing,
that no one believes the lies they tell,
that they grow to be more famous than you,
that you could die in one but you won't be buried in it.

That we use them to create dogs
in our own image. That the dogs
in their mortarboards and baseball caps and veils
crush our hubris with their unconcern.

That Norma Desmond's flirty cocktail hat flung aside
left a cowlick that doomed her. That two old ladies
catfighting in Hutzler's Better Dresses both wore flowered
straw. Of my grandmother the amateur hatmaker,

this legend: that the holdup man at the Mercantile
turned to say Madam I love your hat before
he shot the teller dead who'd giggled at her
homemade velvet roses. O happy tragedy of hats!

That they make us mimic classic gestures,
inspiring pleasure first, then pity and then fear.
See how we tip them, hold them prettily against the wind
or pull them off and mop our sweaty brows

like our beloved foolish dead in photographs.
Like farmers plowing under the ancient sun."
250,Translation,Deirdre O'Connor,"Though there's no such thing as a ""self,"" I missed it—
the fiction of it and how I felt believing in it mildly 
like a book an old love sent with an inscription 
in his hand, whatever it meant, 
After such knowledge, what forgiveness . . .  

—the script of it like the way my self felt 
learning German words by chance—Mitgefühl, 
Unheimlichkeit—and the trailing off that happened 
because I knew only the feelings, abstract 
and international, like ghosts or connotations 
lacking a grammar, a place to go: 

this was the way my self felt when it started 
falling apart: each piece of it clipped 
from a garden vaguely remembered 
by somebody unrecognizable—
such a strange bouquet that somebody sent 
to nobody else, a syntax of blossoms."

snapping turtles 
clutched by little cities

wreathed in scum, 
the gray self sugared, 

half a lot 
of granite 
phlegm stopped 

upon a chaise longue, 
that incoming 
pod of him 

dunked, 
thorny hooves aswim. 
Lichen licked him, 

then he quivered 
in the stem, 
and didactic stoicism stitched 

him tight with 
a neat twine. 
Even when 

tapped on the back 
by a barefoot tricyclist 
with a bulging wheaten midriff, 

he does not respond

a flagellant

paddling worm

252,Truly Pathetic,Neal Bowers,"Lately, the weather aches;
the air is short of breath,
and morning stumbles in, stiff-jointed.

Day by day, the sun bores the sky,
until the moon begins
its tiresome disappearing act,
making the oceans yawn.

Even the seasons change
with a throb of weariness—
bud, bloom, leaf, fall.

If it would help,
I would paint my house silver
or sell it or buy
a red convertible.

I would, but who am I
to try to cheer up
the self-indulgent universe."
253,Trust,Susan Kinsolving,"Trust that there is a tiger, muscular 
Tasmanian, and sly, which has never been 
seen and never will be seen by any human 
eye. Trust that thirty thousand sword- 
fish will never near a ship, that far 
from cameras or cars elephant herds live 
long elephant lives. Believe that bees 
by the billions find unidentified flowers 
on unmapped marshes and mountains. Safe 
in caves of contentment, bears sleep. 
Through vast canyons, horses run while slowly 
snakes stretch beyond their skins in the sun. 
I must trust all this to be true, though 
the few birds at my feeder watch the window 
with small flutters of fear, so like my own."
254,Tutelary,Michael Ryan,"What a fuckup you are.   
What dumbshit you do.

that sweeten each day.   
Your Genius it isn't   
until, dying away,   
   
it worms back through   
the sparkling dream   
where you drown him   
in an inch-deep stream:   
   
your knee in his back,   
your strength on his skull,   
it begins singing   
praise for your skill."
255,[Un Citadin / A City Dweller],Jacques Réda,"The street I walk along I often see  
As if I'd long since left the moving surface  
Of the world for the endless other side that disperses  
Us all some day without return but free  

Of care. I apply myself so well to this fragile proceeding  
That very quickly my gaze ceases to be  
Part of the cloudy clump of hope and memory  
I'll have given my name to. But for this to succeed,  

A feeling of absolute happiness has to make  
Itself felt, as if from outside me, so much  
That at that moment the very street has a hunch  
That it, the entire city, and its uncertain space  

Have become one with the mobile but faithful pattern  
Of phrases written by our steps when we move about.  
I no longer know who's walking and marking out  
The ground, bit by bit, to the corner. My gaze then patterns  

Itself on tomorrow's unknown eyes, which will shine  
When from the roofs, posthumous and vague, mine glow,  
And my invisible trace on the asphalt below    
Might guide the élan of hardier passersby.  

Will they know what I sometimes suspect: what appears  
To be the distracted gaze with which we see  
The world is the world itself?—It sees and hears  
Itself through the thin transparency of our screens."
256,Under Two Windows,Schuyler Van Rensselaer,"I. AUBADE 

The dawn is here—and the long night through I have never seen thy face,
Though my feet have worn the patient grass at the gate of thy dwelling-place.

While the white moon sailed till, red in the west, it found the far world edge,       
No leaflet stirred of the leaves that climb to garland thy window ledge.

Yet the vine had quivered from root to tip, and opened its flowers again,
If only the low moon's light had glanced on a moving casement pane.

Warm was the wind that entered in where the barrier stood ajar,
And the curtain shook with its gentle breath, white as young lilies are;

But there came no hand all the slow night through to draw the folds aside,
(I longed as the moon and the vine-leaves longed!) or to set the casement wide.

Three times in a low-hung nest there dreamed his five sweet notes a bird,
And thrice my heart leaped up at the sound I thought thou hadst surely heard.

But now that thy praise is caroled aloud by a thousand throats awake,
Shall I watch from afar and silently, as under the moon, for thy sake?

Nay—bold in the sun I speak thy name, I too, and I wait no more
Thy hand, thy face, in the window niche, but thy kiss at the open door!

II. NOCTURNE 

My darling, come!—The wings of the dark have wafted the sunset away,
And there's room for much in a summer night, but no room for delay.            
A still moon looketh down from the sky, and a wavering moon looks up
From every hollow in the green hills that holds a pool in its cup.

The woodland borders are wreathed with bloom—elder, viburnum, rose; 
The young trees yearn on the breast of the wind that sighs of love as it goes.

The small stars drown in the moon-washed blue but the greater ones abide,
With Vega high in the midmost place, Altair not far aside.

The glades are dusk, and soft the grass, where the flower of the elder gleams,
Mist-white, moth-like, a spirit awake in the dark of forest dreams.

Arcturus beckons into the east, Antares toward the south,
That sendeth a zephyr sweet with thyme to seek for thy sweeter mouth.

Shall the blossom wake, the star look down, all night and have naught to see?
Shall the reeds that sing by the wind-brushed pool say nothing of thee and me?

—My darling comes! My arms are content, my feet are guiding her way;
There is room for much in a summer night, but no room for delay!"
257,Undone Song at Neap Tide,Kathryn Starbuck,"When the sun and moon were in quadrature, when  
the garden had become a wilderness and the clock refused to strike 

When the old year died and the sand walked into 
the sea with the neap tide 

When you had been too long away and your old snowblue footprints 
clotted and hesitated in the clay

When the worry of this undone song unsung so long 
so loud my head I went inside and under to let the flood run free"
258,"Unusually Warm March Day, Leading to Storms",Francesca Abbate,"Everything is half here, 
like the marble head 
of the Roman emperor 
and the lean torso 
of his favorite. 
The way the funnel cloud 
which doesn't seem 
to touch ground does— 
flips a few cars, a semi— 
we learn to walk miles 
above our bodies. 
The pig farms dissolve, 
then the small hills. 
As in dreams fraught 
with irrevocable gestures, 
the ruined set seems larger, 
a charred palace the gaze 
tunnels through 
and through. How well 
we remember the stage— 
the actors gliding about 
like petite sails, the balustrade 
cooling our palms. 
Not wings or singing, 
but a darkness fast as blood. 
It ended at our fingertips: 
the fence gave way 
to the forest. 
The world began."
259,Update on the Last Judgment,Ellen Hinsey,"There will be no deafening noise. No hornblow of thunder. 

The small plants of the earth will not tremble on the hillside as grace is prepared. 

The sky will neither drown us in its plenty, nor the ground crack and consume feet in its hunger. 

No, bodies will not, in their last rags of flesh, creep from under the earth, and with breath once torn from them, choke and expel the old mud of the world. 

Adam and Eve, incredulous, will not embrace again in their poverty, not knowing whether to shield themselves, or to emerge shameless from the past's shadow, astonished to again greet 
Terra Firma
. 

The book of the world, encrusted with deep-sea pearls and the blood of the lamb, will not open up its pages in which all deeds have been inscribed. 

And the totality of history will not roll back together, all events fusing, once and for all, into the great blazing sphere of time. 

None will sit on the right hand. There will be no right hand. 

And the figure of sorrow and grace, with his staff upright, its purple pennant caught in that final wind, will not be there to greet us, with the mercy of justice in his eyes. 

No, never judgment. Just the abyss into which all acts are thrown down, and the terrible white silence in which judgment either endures or burns."
260,The Visit,Carole Bernstein,"A flashlight rolls over the walls of a cave,
searching, until the transducer comes to a halt
low on my still-flat belly.
The doctor says, ""There's definitely a kid in there.""

Easy for her to say—she sees this all day.
But it took us years to get to this point.
Years in the dark. Months of nothing and never.
Her expert eye interprets the grainy screen,

which I can't stop reaching toward,
pretending to point to features but really
just longing to touch the image,
as if it were somehow more there than in me,

this tiny, blurry, leaping bison or bear,
something from Altamira or Lascaux,
from the hand of an ancestor—
the first art we know."
261,Wake Me in South Galway,Richard Tillinghast,"Wake me in South Galway, or better yet 
In Clare. You'll know the pub I have in mind. 
Improvise a hearse—one of those decrepit 
Postal vans would suit me down to the ground— 
A rust-addled Renault, Kelly green with a splash 
Of Oscar Wilde yellow stirred in to clash 
With the dazzling perfect meadows and limestone 
On the coast road from Kinvara down toward Ballyvaughan. 

Once you've got in off the road at Newquay 
Push aside some barstools and situate me 
Up in front by the door where the musicians sit, 
Their table crowded with pints and a blue teapot, 
A pouch of Drum, some rolling papers and tin 
Whistles. Ask Charlie Piggott to play a tune 
That sounds like loss and Guinness, turf smoke and rain, 
While Brenda dips in among the punters like a hedge-wren. 

Will I hear it? Maybe not. But I hear it now. 
The smoke of the music fills my nostrils, I feel the attuned 
Box and fiddle in harness, pulling the plough 
Of the melody, turning the bog-dark, root-tangled ground. 
Even the ceramic collie on the windowsill 
Cocks an ear as the tune lifts and the taut sail 
Of the Galway hooker trills wildly in its frame on the wall, 
Rippling to the salt pulse and seabreeze of a West Clare reel. 

Many a night, two octaves of one tune, 
We sat here side by side, your body awake 
To a jig or slide, me mending the drift of a line 
As the music found a path to my notebook. 
Lost in its lilt and plunge I would disappear 
Into the heathery freedom of a slow air 
Or walk out under the powerful stars to clear 
My head of thought and breathe their cooled-down fire. 

When my own session ends, let me leave like that, 
Porous to the wind that blows off the ocean. 
Goodbye to the company and step into the night 
Completed and one-off, like a well-played tune— 
Beyond the purified essence of hearth fires 
Rising from the life of the parish, past smoke and stars, 
Released from everything I've done and known. 
I won't go willingly, it's true, but I'll be gone."
262,What Became,Wesley McNair,"What became of the dear  
strands of hair pressed  
against the perspiration  
of your lover's brow  
after lovemaking as you gazed  
into the world of those eyes,  
now only yours?  

What became of any afternoon  
that was so vivid you forgot  
the present was up to its old  
trick of pretending  
it would be there  
always?  

What became of the one  
who believed so deeply  
in this moment he memorized  
everything in it and left  
it for you?"
263,What I Know about Epistemology,John Surowiecki,"As the light goes, go. 
Be the rustling in the grass, the fall from 
convention's good graces: learn, or someone 
will have you filing files or writing writs, 
demonstrating cutlery or selling knowledge 

door to door; someone might even drop 
your lovely life into a factory and have you 
derusting rings on the coolant-spouting 
turntable of a vertical lathe. 
It's best for everyone that what you know 

is generally thought of as general knowledge. 
You can find it in pool rooms and roadside bars, 
in meadows as inviting as beds, in bedrooms 
where it whispers like a ribbon untying; 
you can even find it in schools. But be careful: 

it's dangerous, inescapable and exact 
down to every atom of everything there is, 
to every name each thing goes by and every 
law each thing obeys. And the best part is, 
you always know more than you know."
264,White-Eyes,Mary Oliver,"In winter 
    all the singing is in 
         the tops of the trees 
             where the wind-bird 

with its white eyes 
    shoves and pushes 
         among the branches. 
             Like any of us 

he wants to go to sleep, 
    but he's restless— 
         he has an idea, 
             and slowly it unfolds 

from under his beating wings 
    as long as he stays awake. 
         But his big, round music, after all, 
             is too breathy to last. 

So, it's over. 
    In the pine-crown 
         he makes his nest, 
             he's done all he can. 

I don't know the name of this bird, 
    I only imagine his glittering beak 
         tucked in a white wing 
             while the clouds— 

which he has summoned 
    from the north— 
         which he has taught 
             to be mild, and silent— 

thicken, and begin to fall 
    into the world below 
         like stars, or the feathers 
               of some unimaginable bird 

that loves us, 
    that is asleep now, and silent— 
         that has turned itself 
             into snow."
265,Why Are Your Poems so Dark?,Linda Pastan,"Isn't the moon dark too,  
most of the time?  

And doesn't the white page  
seem unfinished  

without the dark stain  
of alphabets?  

When God demanded light,  
he didn't banish darkness.  

Instead he invented  
ebony and crows  

and that small mole  
on your left cheekbone.  

Or did you mean to ask  
""Why are you sad so often?""  

Ask the moon.  
Ask what it has witnessed."
266,Willowspout,R. T. Smith,"Because someone thirsty enough 
to trust Old Testament wisdom 
followed the deepening greens 

and found a spring, silver 
in the shadow of blue ridges, 
I can kneel beneath 

this spill of willow 
limbs a century later 
and drink water 

risen from roots 
to enter the evening 
through a spout, the way 

Cherokee stories say the first 
people were born, 
washing into the world 

of such trees whose bark, 
like the water I cup 
to my parched mouth, 

tastes leafy and sweet 
and has the power, 
the old ones say, to heal."
267,Worms,Carl Dennis,"Aren't you glad at least that the earthworms  
Under the grass are ignorant, as they eat the earth,  
Of the good they confer on us, that their silence  
Isn't a silent reproof for our bad manners,  
Our never casting earthward a crumb of thanks  
For their keeping the soil from packing so tight  
That no root, however determined, could pierce it?  

Imagine if they suspected how much we owe them,  
How the weight of our debt would crush us  
Even if they enjoyed keeping the grass alive,  
The garden flowers and vegetables, the clover,  
And wanted nothing that we could give them,  
Not even the merest nod of acknowledgment.  
A debt to angels would be easy in comparison,  
Bright, weightless creatures of cloud, who serve  
An even brighter and lighter master.  

Lucky for us they don't know what they're doing,  
These puny anonymous creatures of dark and damp  
Who eat simply to live, with no more sense of mission  
Than nature feels in providing for our survival.  
Better save our gratitude for a friend  
Who gives us more than we can give in return  
And never hints she's waiting for reciprocity.  

""If I had nickel, I'd give it to you,""  
The lover says, who, having nothing available  
In the solid, indicative world, scrapes up  
A coin or two in the world of the subjunctive.  
""A nickel with a hole drilled in the top  
So you can fasten it to your bracelet, a charm  
To protect you against your enemies.""  

For his sake, she'd wear it, not for her own,  
So he might believe she's safe as she saunters  
Home across the field at night, the moon above her,  
Below her the loam, compressed by the soles of her loafers,  
And the tunneling earthworms, tireless, silent,  
As they persist, oblivious, in their service."
268,Writing in the Afterlife,Billy Collins,"I imagined the atmosphere would be clear, 
shot with pristine light, 
not this sulphurous haze, 
the air ionized as before a thunderstorm. 

Many have pictured a river here, 
but no one mentioned all the boats, 
their benches crowded with naked passengers, 
each bent over a writing tablet. 

I knew I would not always be a child 
with a model train and a model tunnel, 
and I knew I would not live forever, 
jumping all day through the hoop of myself. 

I had heard about the journey to the other side 
and the clink of the final coin 
in the leather purse of the man holding the oar, 
but how could anyone have guessed 

that as soon as we arrived 
we would be asked to describe this place 
and to include as much detail as possible— 
not just the water, he insists, 

rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water, 
not simply the shackles, but the rusty, 
iron, ankle-shredding shackles— 
and that our next assignment would be 

to jot down, off the tops of our heads, 
our thoughts and feelings about being dead, 
not really an assignment, 
the man rotating the oar keeps telling us— 

think of it more as an exercise, he groans, 
think of writing as a process, 
a never-ending, infernal process, 
and now the boats have become jammed together, 

bow against stern, stern locked to bow, 
and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens."
269,ΧΟΡΙΚΣ,Richard Aldington,"The ancient songs
Pass deathward mournfully.

Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,
Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings—
Symbols of ancient songs
Mournfully passing
Down to the great white surges,
Watched of none         - -
Save the frail sea-birds
And the lithe pale girls,
Daughters of Okeanos.

And the songs pass
From the green land
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf
On the flowers of hyacinth;
And they pass from the waters,
The manifold winds and the dim moon,
And they come,
Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,
To the quiet level lands
That she keeps for us all,
That she wrought for us all for sleep
In the silver days of the earth's dawning—
Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.

And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,
And we turn from thee,
Phoibos Apollon,
And we turn from the music of old
And the hills that we loved and the meads,
And we turn from the fiery day,
And the lips that were over-sweet;
For silently
Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,
With purple robe
Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,
Death,
Thou hast come upon us.

And of all the ancient songs
Passing to the swallow-blue halls
By the dark streams of Persephone,
This only remains:
That in the end we turn to thee,
Death,
That we turn to thee, singing
One last song.

O Death,
Thou art an healing wind
That blowest over white flowers
A-tremble with dew;
Thou art a wind flowing
Over long leagues of lonely sea;
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
Thou art the pale peace of one
Satiate with old desires;
Thou art the silence of beauty,
And we look no more for the morning;
We yearn no more for the sun,
Since with thy white hands,
Death,
Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,
The slim colorless poppies
Which in thy garden alone
Softly thou gatherest.

And silently;
And with slow feet approaching;
And with bowed head and unlit eyes,
We kneel before thee:
And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us
Flowers from thy thin cold hands,
And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,
Thou sealest our eyes
And the illimitable quietude
Comes gently upon us."
270,You Can't Buy Shoes in a Painting,Jill Osier,"You can't even buy a soda. You can only
see these things, see a mother steer
her son to the car, his head cocked
licking his ice cream.

Earlier, driving, trying to keep
between two cornfields, I couldn't see myself
into a map, couldn't be anywhere in it,
though I knew all the patient states
between us.

Pigeons sit high on a mill's peaked roof,
spaced even as beads. They can stand that
close to each other, but looking at them
you wouldn't know it. Would you."
271,You People,Nance Van Winckel,"People, don't ask me again where my shoes are.
The valley I walked through was frozen to me
as I was to it. My heavy hide, my zinc
talisman—I'm fine, people. Don't stare
at my feet. And don't flash the sign of the cross
in my face. I carry the Blue Cross Card—
card among cards, card of my number
and gold seal. So shall ye know I am of
the system, in the beast's belly and up
to here, people, with your pity.

People, what is wrong with you? I don't care
what the sign on your door says. I will go
to another door. I will knock and rattle
and if you won't, then surely someone, somewhere,
will put a pancake in my hand.

You people of the rhetorical huh? You lords and ladies
of the blooming stump, I bend over you, taste you,
keep an eye on you, dream for you the beginning
of what you may one day dream an end to.

The new century peeled me bone-bare
like a first song inside a warbler—that bird, people,         
who knows not to go where the sky's stopped.
Keep this in mind. Do you think
the fox won't find your nest? That
the egg of you will endure the famine?

You, you people born of moons with no
mother-planets, you who are back-lit,
who have no fathers in heaven, hear now
the bruise-knuckled knock of me. I am returned.

From your alley. From your car up on blocks.
From the battered, graffitied railcars that uncouple
and move out into the studded green lightning.

Dare you trust any longer the chained-up dogs of hell
not to bust free? Or that because your youth's
been ransacked, nothing more will be asked of you?
If a bloody foot's dragged across your coiffed lawn—
do not confuse me with dawn.

Now people, about the shoes: the shoes
have no doubt entered the sea
and are by now walking the ramparts of Atlantis.
I may be a false prophet, but god bless me, at least
I have something to say. I lay myself down
in a pencil of night—no chiseled tip yet,
but the marks already forming in the lead."
272,You That I Loved,A. F. Moritz,"You that I loved all my life long, 
you are not the one. 
You that I followed, my line or path or way, 
that I followed singing, and you 
earth and air of the world the way went through, 
and you who stood around it so it could be 
the way, you forests and cities, 
you deer and opossums struck by the lonely hunter 
and left decaying, you paralyzed obese ones 
who sat on a falling porch in a deep green holler 
and observed me, your bald dog barking, 
as I stumbled past in a hurry along my line, 
you are not the one. But you 
are the one, you that I loved all my life long, 
you I still love so in my dying mind 
I grasp me loving you when we are gone. 
You are the one, you path or way or line 
that winds beside the house where she and I live on, 
still longing though long gone 
for the health of all forests and cities, 
and one day to visit them, 
one day be rich and free enough to go and see 
the restricted wonders of the earth. 
And you are the one, old ladies fated from birth 
to ugliness, obesity and dearth, 
who sat beside my path 
one day as I flashed by. And you are the one, 
all tumble-down shacks in disregarded hills 
and animals the car on the road kills 
and leaves stinking in the sun."
273,Your Clothes,Judith Kroll,"Of course they are empty shells, without hope of animation. 
Of course they are artifacts. 

Even if my sister and I should wear some, 
or if we give others away, 

they will always be your clothes without you, 
as we will always be your daughters without you."
274,“Your Luck Is About To Change”,Susan Elizabeth Howe,"(A fortune cookie)

Ominous inscrutable Chinese news 
to get just before Christmas, 
considering my reasonable health, 
marriage spicy as moo-goo-gai-pan, 
career running like a not-too-old Chevrolet. 
Not bad, considering what can go wrong: 
the bony finger of Uncle Sam 
might point out my husband, 
my own national guard, 
and set him in Afghanistan; 
my boss could take a personal interest; 
the pain in my left knee could spread to my right. 
Still, as the old year tips into the new, 
I insist on the infant hope, gooing and kicking 
his legs in the air. I won't give in 
to the dark, the sub-zero weather, the fog, 
or even the neighbors' Nativity. 
Their four-year-old has arranged 
his whole legion of dinosaurs 
so they, too, worship the child, 
joining the cow and sheep. Or else, 
ultimate mortals, they've come to eat 
ox and camel, Mary and Joseph, 
then savor the newborn babe."
