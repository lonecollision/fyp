580,Very Strong February,Bernadette Mayer,"A man and a woman pretend to be white ice
Three men at the lavender door are closed in by the storm
With strong prejudice and money to buy the green pines
One weekend fisherman and blue painters watch
The vivid violet winds blow visibility from the mountain
Beyond the black valley. That means or then you know
You’re in a big cloud of it, it’s brilliant white mid-February
A week or two left on distracting black trees
Before the brownish buds obscure your view of the valley again.

Looking for company four dark men and a burnt sienna woman
Come in for three minutes, then bye-bye like a gold watch left on the
                  chair
Or part of the sum of what big white families think up
To store for long yellow Sundays to eat for brown ecological
                  company.
At some point later gorgeous red adventure stops, did you forget
To turn it down and laugh in the face of the fearful white storm
                  anyway
Or picture it brilliant blue for a further Sunday memory
In a coloring book, you talk as lightly as you can
Refusing a big pink kiss, you burned the Sunday sauce
Of crushed red tomatoes, you turn it down to just an orange glow.
This particular storm, considering the pause and the greenish thaw before it
Reminds me in its mildness of imitating a sea-green memory that is
                  actually
In the future, I imitate an imagined trumpet sound
Or the brilliant purple words of a man or woman I haven’t met yet
Or perhaps it’s a grey-haired man I already know who said some-
                  thing yesterday
To a mutual friend who will give me the whole story in black and
                  white tomorrow
Or the day after, just as the big orange plows for the local businesses
Go to work to push away the rest of the white snow that will fall
                  tonight."
581,Vesper Sparrows,Deborah Digges,"I love to watch them sheathe themselves mid-air,
shut wings and ride the light’s poor spine

to earth, to touch down in gutters, in the rainbowed
urine of suicides, just outside Bellevue’s walls.

From in there the ransacked cadavers are carried
up the East River to Potter’s Field

as if they were an inheritance,
gleaned of saveable parts,

their diseases jarred and labeled, or incinerated,
the ashes of metastisized vision

professing the virus that lives beyond the flesh
in air ...

               
               The first time I saw the inside of anything
alive, a downed bird opened cleanly

under my heel. I knelt
to watch the spectral innards shine and quicken,

the heart-whir magnify.
And though I can’t say now what kind of bird it was,

nor the season, spring or autumn, what
dangerous transition,

I have identified so many times that sudden
earnest spasm of the throat in children,

or in the jaundiced faces of the dying,
the lower eye-lids straining upward.

Fear needs its metaphors.
I’ve read small helplessnesses make us maternal.

Even the sparrows feel it,
nesting this evening in traffic lights.

They must have remembered, long enough to mate,
woods they’ve never seen,

but woods inbred up the long light of instinct,
the streaked siennas of a forest floor

born now into the city,
the oak umbers, and the white tuft

of tail feathers like a milkweed meadow
in which their song, as Burroughs heard it,

could be distinguished:
 come-come-where-where-all-together-

down-the-hill ...
here, where every history is forfeited,

where the same names of the different dead greet
each other and commingle

above the hospital’s heaps of garbage.
From the ward windows, fingerprinted,

from the iron-grated ledges,
hundreds flock down for the last feed of the day

and carry off into the charitable dusk what
cannot be digested."
582,"Vespers [In your extended absence, you permit me]",Louise Glück,"In your extended absence, you permit me
use of earth, anticipating
some return on investment. I must report
failure in my assignment, principally
regarding the tomato plants.
I think I should not be encouraged to grow
tomatoes. Or, if I am, you should withhold
the heavy rains, the cold nights that come
so often here, while other regions get
twelve weeks of summer. All this
belongs to you: on the other hand,
I planted the seeds, I watched the first shoots
like wings tearing the soil, and it was my heart
broken by the blight, the black spot so quickly
multiplying in the rows. I doubt
you have a heart, in our understanding of
that term. You who do not discriminate
between the dead and the living, who are, in consequence,
immune to foreshadowing, you may not know
how much terror we bear, the spotted leaf,
the red leaves of the maple falling
even in August, in early darkness: I am responsible
for these vines."
583,"Vespers [""Once I believed in you...""]",Louise Glück,"Once I believed in you; I planted a fig tree.
Here, in Vermont, country
of no summer. It was a test: if the tree lived,
it would mean you existed.

By this logic, you do not exist. Or you exist
exclusively in warmer climates,
in fervent Sicily and Mexico and California,
where are grown the unimaginable
apricot and fragile peach. Perhaps
they see your face in Sicily; here we barely see
the hem of your garment. I have to discipline myself
to share with John and Noah the tomato crop.

If there is justice in some other world, those
like myself, whom nature forces
into lives of abstinence, should get
the lion's share of all things, all
objects of hunger, greed being
praise of you. And no one praises
more intensely than I, with more
painfully checked desire, or more deserves
to sit at your right hand, if it exists, partaking
of the perishable, the immortal fig,
which does not travel."
584,Vessel,Tom Sleigh,"Branching the way blind fingers splay across
The face they’re reading, trees trace the backyard
Ditch sop that their shadows drop off into
Space,
           an abyss where I hear a neighbor boy’s
Voice cursing an exhilarated, out of its mind,

          Unappeasably inventive flow of
“Fuck fuck motherfuck” ecstasy that maybe
He imagines the neighborhood can't hear?—
                                                               or is his tongue wired
To some source of inspired but as yet unknown
Intelligence that radiates from all of us and he

          Is its mouthpiece, speaking it to the trees
That screen him from me listening to his
Unrelenting arias, predestined like birdsong
Flowing unbidden, of four-letter almost
Erotic keening over something I know too,

          Everybody knows?—
                                       and even if all it is
Is the “fuck fuck motherfuck” ecstasy
Of April budding in his mouth and sending down
Roots to some anti-self that sprouts and shadows
Him as it croons and shouts the song of its difference—

          Even then, this Billy whom I don’t think twice about
When we meet in the alley and slap palms
Or I see him playing alone on the swings of big kids’ slide,
Even then is he the vessel
                                          of some signal that uses us,
Down in the abyss irradiating him so that just this instant

          Whatever that other uses him for he can’t resist:
His voice an instrument of blissed-out torment
Until that grip flings him loose—
Who knows which of us it chooses to penetrate
Next, making us suddenly sweat or shiver,

That influence bathing everything budding
                                                             in profane rays."
585,Vestibule,Chase Twichell,"What etiquette holds us back
from more intimate speech,
especially now, at the end of the world?
Can’t we begin a conversation
here in the vestibule,
then gradually move it inside?
What holds us back
from saying things outright?
We’ve killed the earth.
Yet we speak of other things.
Our words should cauterize
all wounds to the truth."
586,Veteran’s Hospital,Ben Belitt,"(White River Junction, Vermont)

Bringing “only what is needed—essential
toilet articles” in a paper bag,
dressed as for dying, one sees the dying plainly.
These are the homecomings of Agamemnon,
the odysseys to the underside of the web
that weaves and unweaves while the suitors gorge upon plenty
and the languishing sons at home unwish their warring
fathers with strong electric fingers.

The fathers are failing.

In the Hospital Exchange, one sees the dying plainly:
color televisions, beach towels, automatic razors—
the hardware of the affluent society marked
down to cost, to match the negative afflatus
of the ailing, the bandages and badges of their status.
Under the sandbags, rubber hoses, pipettes, bed-clamps,
tax-exempt, amenable as rabbits,
the unenlisted men are bleeding through their noses
in a perimeter of ramps and apparatus.

In that prosthetic world, the Solarium
lights up a junk-pile of used parts: the hip that caught
a ricochet of shrapnel; tattoos in curing meats;
scars like fizzled fuses; canceled postage stamps;
automated claws in candy; the Laser’s edge; and barium.
The nurses pass like mowers, dressing and
undressing in the razor-sharp incisions
and the flowering phosphorescence. The smell
of rubbing alcohol rises on desertions and deprivals
and divorces. It is incorruptible. A wheelchair aims
its hospital pajamas like a gun-emplacement.

The amputee is swinging in his aviary.
His fingers walk the bird-bars.

There is singing
from the ward room—a buzzing of transistors
like blueflies in a urinal. War over war,
the expendables of Metz and Chateau-Thierry,
the guerillas of Bien Hoa and Korea,
the draftees, the Reserves, the re-enlisters,
open a common wavelength.
The catatonic
sons are revving up their combos in the era
of the angry adolescent. Their cry is electronic.
Their thumbs are armed with picks. The acid-rock guitarist
in metal studs and chevrons, bombed with magnesium,
mourns like a country yokel, and the innocents
are slaughtered.

On the terrace, there are juices
and bananas. The convalescent listens to his
heartbeat. The chaplain and his non-combative daughter
smile by the clubbed plants on the portico.

 “They shall overcome.”"
587,Vetiver,John Ashbery,"Ages passed slowly, like a load of hay,
As the flowers recited their lines
And pike stirred at the bottom of the pond.
The pen was cool to the touch.
The staircase swept upward
Through fragmented garlands, keeping the melancholy
Already distilled in letters of the alphabet.

It would be time for winter now, its spun-sugar
Palaces and also lines of care
At the mouth, pink smudges on the forehead and cheeks,
The color once known as “ashes of roses.”
How many snakes and lizards shed their skins
For time to be passing on like this,
Sinking deeper in the sand as it wound toward
The conclusion. It had all been working so well and now,
Well, it just kind of came apart in the hand
As a change is voiced, sharp
As a fishhook in the throat, and decorative tears flowed
Past us into a basin called infinity.

There was no charge for anything, the gates
Had been left open intentionally.
Don’t follow, you can have whatever it is.
And in some room someone examines his youth,
Finds it dry and hollow, porous to the touch.
O keep me with you, unless the outdoors
Embraces both of us, unites us, unless
The birdcatchers put away their twigs,
The fishermen haul in their sleek empty nets
And others become part of the immense crowd
Around this bonfire, a situation
That has come to mean us to us, and the crying
In the leaves is saved, the last silver drops."
588,VI Mon. August [1742] hath xxxi days.,Benjamin Franklin,"The Busy-Man's Picture

BUSINESS, thou Plague and Pleasure of my Life, 
Thou charming Mistress, thou vexatious Wife; 
Thou Enemy, thou Friend, to Joy, to Grief, 
Thou bring’st me all, and bring’st me no Relief, 
Thou bitter, sweet, thou pleasing, teazing Thing, 
Thou Bee, that with thy Honey wears a Sting; 
Some Respite, prithee do, yet do not give, 
I cannot with thee, nor without thee live."
589,Victims of the Latest Dance Craze,Cornelius Eady,"The streamers choking the main arteries
Of downtown.
The brass band led by a child
From the home for the handicapped.
The old men
Showing their hair (what’s left of it),
The buttons of their shirts Popping in time
To the salsa flooding out
Of their portable headphones,

And mothers letting their babies
Be held by strangers.
And the bus drivers
Taping over their fare boxes
And willing to give directions.

Is there any reason to mention
All the drinks are on the house?
Thick, adolescent boys
Dismantle their BB guns.
Here is the world (what’s left of it),
In brilliant motion,
The oil slick at the curb
Danced into a thousand
Splintered steps.
The bag ladies toss off their
Garments
To reveal wings.

“This dance you do,” drawls the cop,
“What do you call it?”
We call it scalding the air.
We call it dying with your
Shoes on.

And across the street
The bodies of tramps
Stumble
In a sober language.

And across the street
Shy young girls step behind
Their nameless boyfriends,
Twirling their skirts.

And under an archway
A delivery boy discovers
His body has learned to speak,
And what does this street look like
If not a runway,
A polished wood floor?

From the air,
Insects drawn by the sweat
Alight, when possible,
On the blur
Of torsos.
It is the ride
Of their tiny lives.
The wind that burns their wings,
The heaving, oblivious flesh,
Mountains stuffed with panic,
An ocean
That can’t make up its mind.
They drop away
With the scorched taste
Of vertigo.

And under a swinging light bulb
Some children
Invent a game
With the shadow the bulb makes,
And the beat of their hearts.
They call it dust in the mouth.
They call it horse with no rider.
They call it school with empty books.

In the next room
Their mother throws her dress away to chance.
It drops to the floor
Like a brush sighs across a drum head,
And when she takes her lover,
What are they thinking of
If not a ballroom filled with mirrors,
A world where no one has the right
To stumble?

In a parking lot
An old man says this:
“I am a ghost dance.
I remember the way my hair felt,
Damp with sweat and wind.

When the wind kisses the leaves, I am dancing.
When the subway hits the third rail, I am dancing.
When the barrel goes over Niagara Falls, I am dancing.
Music rings my bones like metal.

O, Jazz has come from heaven,” he says,
And at the z he jumps, arcing his back like a heron’s neck,
And stands suddenly revealed
As a balance demon,
A home for
Stetson hats.

We have all caught the itch:
The neon artist
Wiring up his legs,
The tourist couple
Recording the twist on their
Instamatic camera,
And in a factory,
A janitor asks his broom
For a waltz,
And he grasps it like a woman
He’d have to live another
Life to meet,
And he spins around the dust bin
And machines and thinks:
 Is everybody happy?
And he spins out the side door,
Avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk,
Grinning as if he’d just received
The deepest kiss in the world."
590,The Victor Dog,James Merrill,"for Elizabeth Bishop

Bix to Buxtehude to Boulez.
The little white dog on the Victor label
Listens long and hard as he is able.
It’s all in a day’s work, whatever plays.

From judgment, it would seem, he has refrained.   
He even listens earnestly to Bloch,
Then builds a church upon our acid rock.
He’s man’s—no—he’s the Leiermann’s best friend,   

Or would be if hearing and listening were the same.   
 Does he hear? I fancy he rather smells
Those lemon-gold arpeggios in Ravel’s
“Les jets d’eau du palais de ceux qui s’aiment.”

He ponders the Schumann Concerto’s tall willow hit   
By lightning, and stays put. When he surmises   
Through one of Bach’s eternal boxwood mazes   
The oboe pungent as a bitch in heat,

Or when the calypso decants its raw bay rum
Or the moon in Wozzeck reddens ripe for murder,   
He doesn’t sneeze or howl; just listens harder.   
Adamant needles bear down on him from

Whirling of outer space, too black, too near—
But he was taught as a puppy not to flinch,   
Much less to imitate his bête noire Blanche   
Who barked, fat foolish creature, at King Lear.

Still others fought in the road’s filth over Jezebel,   
Slavered on hearths of horned and pelted barons.   
His forebears lacked, to say the least, forbearance.   
Can nature change in him? Nothing’s impossible.

The last chord fades. The night is cold and fine.
His master’s voice rasps through the grooves’ bare groves.   
Obediently, in silence like the grave’s
He sleeps there on the still-warm gramophone

Only to dream he is at the première of a Handel   
Opera long thought lost—Il Cane Minore.
Its allegorical subject is his story!
A little dog revolving round a spindle

Gives rise to harmonies beyond belief,
A cast of stars . . . Is there in Victor’s heart   
No honey for the vanquished? Art is art.   
The life it asks of us is a dog’s life."
591,Vietnam,Michael Collier,"The shape of it bending like an eel
or disfigured quarter moon, pink and green
and brown, like a rainbow trout. The wall

along my bed covered with the map I cut
from the newspaper, and next to it the fishing
calendar from Abonauder’s Texaco. The square

cages of days with their numerals and effigies
of moon and fish shaded to indicate the shape
of the moon, the hunger of the fish.

The white bread stripped of its crust, dampened,
then dusted with flour, compressed into a tight ball,
wrapped in foil and chilled all night.

A piece of it pressed and shaped on the tip
of an Eagle Claw hook, then lowered into the nesting holes
of blue gill. The plastic bobber floating

on the surface like a silent doorbell. A whole world
of cause and effect, framed day-by-day and week-by-week.
The passage of time as a kind of game in which

I transferred numbers from the newspaper
to the calendar. The body counts and their categories
of NVRA, Marines, Montagnards.

And each morning I put a bold X through the previous
day not to erase or forget it but to connect
the corners, make four triangles of the square.

And it was rare if not impossible to catch
the blue gill that swam and swam around
the tidy pebble craters of their nests,

or coax them out except in hostile swerves
and feints toward the bait that hung
like a balloon of gravity over their homes,

a suspicious egg pouch or cocoon, something
a storm might have dislodged from the bank
and blown like a feared gift into the water,

a thing swallowed whole then run with
until the line played out and the hook set fast."
592,VII Mon. September [1742] hath xxx days.,Benjamin Franklin,"The Reverse

Studious of Ease, and fond of humble Things, 
Below the Smiles, below the Frowns of Kings: 
Thanks to my Stars, I prize the Sweets of Life, 
No sleepless Nights I count, no Days of Strife. 
I rest, I wake, I drink, I sometimes love, 
I read, I write, I settle, or I rove; 
Content to live, content to die unknown, 
Lord of myself, accountable to none."
593,Villon,Basil Bunting,"I

He whom we anatomized
‘whose words we gathered as pleasant flowers
and thought on his wit and how neatly he described things’   
speaks
to us, hatching marrow,
broody all night over the bones of a deadman.

My tongue is a curve in the ear. Vision is lies.
We saw is so and it was not so,
the Emperor with the Golden Hands, the Virgin in blue.   
(—A blazing parchment,
Matthew Paris his kings in blue and gold.)

It was not so,
scratched on black by God knows who,   
by God, by God knows who.

In the dark in fetters
on bended elbows I supported my weak back
hulloing to muffled walls blank again
unresonant. It was gone, is silent, is always silent.
My soundbox lacks sonority. All but inaudible
I stammer to my ear:
Naked speech! Naked beggar both blind and cold!
Wrap it for my sake in Paisley shawls and bright soft fabric,   
wrap it in curves and cover it with sleek lank hair.

What trumpets? What bright hands? Fetters, it was the Emperor   
with magic in darkness, I unforewained.
The golden hands are not in Averrhoes,
eyes lie and this swine’s fare bread and water
makes my head wuzz. Have pity, have pity on me!

To the right was darkness and to the left hardness   
below hardness darkness above
at the feet darkness at the head partial hardness   
with equal intervals without
to the left moaning and beyond a scurry.   
In those days rode the good Lorraine
whom English burned at Rouen,
the day’s bones whitening in centuries’ dust.

Then he saw his ghosts glitter with golden hands,   
the Emperor sliding up and up from his tomb   
alongside Charles. These things are not obliterate.   
White gobs spitten for mockery;
and I too shall have CY GIST, written over me.

Remember, imbeciles and wits,   
sots and ascetics, fair and foul,   
young girls with little tender tits,   
that DEATH is written over all.

Worn hides that scarcely clothe the soul   
they are so rotten, old and thin,
or firm and soft and warm and full—   
fellmonger Death gets every skin.

All that is piteous, all that’s fair,   
all that is fat and scant of breath,   
Elisha’s baldness, Helen’s hair,   
is Death’s collateral:

Three score and ten years after sight   
of this pay me your pulse and breath   
value received. And who dare cite,   
as we forgive our debtors, Death?

Abelard and Eloise,
Henry the Fowler, Charlemagne,   
Genée, Lopokova, all these
die, die in pain.

And General Grant and General Lee,   
Patti and Florence Nightingale,   
like Tyro and Antiope
drift among ghosts in Hell,

know nothing, are nothing, save a fume   
driving across a mind
preoccupied with this: our doom   
is, to be sifted by the wind,

heaped up, smoothed down like silly sands.   
We are less permanent than thought.
The Emperor with the Golden Hands

is still a word, a tint, a tone,
insubstantial-glorious,
when we ourselves are dead and gone   
and the green grass growing over us.

Let his days be few and let
his bishoprick pass to another,
for he fed me on carrion and on a dry crust,   
mouldy bread that his dogs had vomited,
I lying on my back in the dark place, in the grave,   
fettered to a post in the damp cellarage.
            Whereinall we differ not. But they have swept the floor,   
there are no dancers, no somersaulters now,   
only bricks and bleak black cement and bricks,   
only the military tread and the snap of the locks.
            Mine was a threeplank bed whereon   
I lay and cursed the weary sun.
They took away the prison clothes
and on the frosty nights I froze.
I had a Bible where I read
that Jesus came to raise the dead—
I kept myself from going mad
by singing an old bawdy ballad
and birds sang on my windowsill
and tortured me till I was ill,
but Archipiada came to me
and comforted my cold body
and Circe excellent utterer of her mind
lay with me in that dungeon for a year
making a silk purse from an old sow’s ear
till Ronsard put a thimble on her tongue.
    Whereinall we differ not. But they have named all the stars,   
trodden down the scrub of the desert, run the white moon to a schedule,   
Joshua’s serf whose beauty drove men mad.
They have melted the snows from Erebus, weighed the clouds,   
hunted down the white bear, hunted the whale the seal the kangaroo,   
they have set private enquiry agents onto Archipiada:
What is your name? Your maiden name?
Go in there to be searched. I suspect it is not your true name.   
Distinguishing marks if any? (O anthropometrics!)
Now the thumbprints for filing.
Colour of hair? of eyes? of hands? O Bertillon!
How many golden prints on the smudgy page?
Homer? Adest. Dante? Adest.
Adsunt omnes, omnes et
Villon.
Villon?
Blacked by the sun, washed by the rain,
hither and thither scurrying as the wind varies.

Under the olive trees   
walking alone
on the green terraces   
very seldom
over the sea seldom
where it ravelled and spun
blue tapestries white and green
gravecloths of men   
Romans and modern men   
and the men of the sea
who have neither nation nor time
on the mountains seldom   
the white mountains beyond
or the brown mountains between
and their drifting echoes
in the clouds and over the sea
in shrines on their ridges
the goddess of the country
silverplated in silk and embroidery
with offerings of pictures
little ships and arms   
below me the ports   
with naked breasts   
shipless spoiled sacked   
because of the beauty of Helen

precision clarifying vagueness;
boundary to a wilderness
of detail; chisel voice
smoothing the flanks of noise;
catalytic making whisper and whisper   
run together like two drops of quicksilver;   
factor that resolves
                        unnoted harmonies;
name of the nameless;
                        stuff that clings
to frigid limbs
                        more marble hard
than girls imagined by Mantegna ...   

The sea has no renewal, no forgetting,   
no variety of death,
is silent with the silence of a single note.

How can I sing with my love in my bosom?   
Unclean, immature and unseasonable salmon."
594,The Vine,Robert Herrick,"I dreamed this mortal part of mine
Was metamorphosed to a vine,
Which crawling one and every way
Enthralled my dainty Lucia.
Methought her long small legs and thighs
I with my tendrils did surprise;
Her belly, buttocks, and her waist
By my soft nervelets were embraced.
About her head I writhing hung,
And with rich clusters (hid among
The leaves) her temples I behung,
So that my Lucia seemed to me
Young Bacchus ravished by his tree.
My curls about her neck did crawl,
And arms and hands they did enthrall,
So that she could not freely stir
(All parts there made one prisoner).
But when I crept with leaves to hide
Those parts which maids keep unespied,
Such fleeting pleasures there I took
That with the fancy I awoke;
And found (ah me!) this flesh of mine
More like a stock than like a vine."
595,"Violetta, 2000",Honor Moore,"A black satin purse in her right hand,
condoms, spermicide,
her key to the birdcage elevator.
All night, thunder and rain
in a flash of lightning, his hands visible,
leaves of philodendron, a half-moon table.

They talk in near dark, eating from a basket.
She places her hand in his lap,
opens her legs as if God came from her,
fragrance pluming like smoke.
All night, his tongue like a fish
philodendron green smoothing half-light.

Now the bridge is illuminated, twin
arches rising, chalky, incandescent,
light abandoning the dome of sky,
river breathing azure, its surface frazzled,
the moon leaving her scuff marks.
Near the open window, dark of leaves.

Outside at dawn, the sun hidden,
a crow lowering itself on black wings
crosses before windows as gold as Rome.
The telephone, her mouth open.
I can see all the way into you, he says.
Leaves of philodendron pour from the table."
596,Virginity,Anna Swir,"One must be brave to live through
a day. What remains
is nothing but the pleasure of longing—very precious.

Longing
purifies as does flying, strengthens as does an effort,
it fashions the soul
as work
fashions the belly.

It is like an athlete, like a runner
who will never
stop running. And this
gives him endurance.

Longing
is nourishing for the strong.
It is like a window
on a high tower, through which
blows the wind of strength.

Longing,
Virginity of happiness."
597,"A Vision of a Wrangler, of a University, of Pedantry, and of Philosophy",James Clerk Maxwell,"Deep St. Mary’s bell had sounded, 
And the twelve notes gently rounded 
Endless chimneys that surrounded 
      My abode in Trinity. 
(Letter G, Old Court, South Attics), 
I shut up my mathematics, 
That confounded hydrostatics— 
      Sink it in the deepest sea! 

In the grate the flickering embers 
Served to show how dull November’s 
Fogs had stamped my torpid members, 
      Like a plucked and skinny goose. 
And as I prepared for bed, I 
Asked myself with voice unsteady, 
If of all the stuff I read, I 
      Ever made the slightest use. 

Late to bed and early rising, 
Ever luxury despising, 
Ever training, never “sizing,” 
      I have suffered with the rest. 
Yellow cheek and forehead ruddy, 
Memory confused and muddy, 
These are the effects of study 
      Of a subject so unblest. 

Look beyond, and see the wrangler, 
Now become a College dangler, 
Court some spiritual angler, 
      Nibbling at his golden bait. 
Hear him silence restive Reason, 
Her advice is out of season, 
While her lord is plotting treason 
      Gainst himself, and Church or State. 

See him next with place and pension, 
And the very best intention 
Of upholding that Convention 
      Under which his fortunes rose. 
Every scruple is rejected, 
With his cherished schemes connected, 
“Higher Powers may be neglected— 
      His result no further goes.” 

Much he lauds the education 
Which has raised to lofty station, 
Men, whose powers of calculation 
      Calculation’s self defied. 
How the learned fool would wonder 
Were he now to see his blunder, 
When he put his reason under 
      The control of worldly Pride. 

Thus I muttered, very seedy, 
Husky was my throat, and reedy; 
And no wonder, for indeed I 
      Now had caught a dreadful cold. 
Thickest fog had settled slowly 
Round the candle, burning lowly, 
Round the fire, where melancholy 
      Traced retreating hills of gold. 

Still those papers lay before me— 
Problems made express to bore me, 
When a silent change came o’er me, 
      In my hard uneasy chair. 
Fire and fog, and candle faded, 
Spectral forms the room invaded, 
Little creatures, that paraded 
      On the problems lying there. 

Fathers there, of every college, 
Led the glorious ranks of knowledge, 
Men, whose virtues all acknowledge 
      Levied the proctorial fines; 
There the modest Moderators, 
Set apart as arbitrators 
’Twixt contending calculators, 
      Scrutinised the trembling lines. 

All the costly apparatus, 
That is meant to elevate us 
To the intellectual status 
      Necessary for degrees— 
College tutors—private coaches— 
Line the Senate-house approaches. 
If our Alma Mater dote, she’s 
      Taken care of well by these. 

Much I doubted if the vision 
Were the simple repetition 
Of the statements of Commission, 
      Strangely jumbled, oddly placed. 
When an awful form ascended, 
And with cruel words defended 
Those abuses that offended 
      My unsanctioned private taste. 

Angular in form and feature, 
Unlike any earthly creature, 
She had properties to meet your 
      Eye whatever you might view. 
Hair of pens and skin of paper; 
Breath, not breath but chemic vapour; 
Dress,—such dress as College Draper 
      Fashions with precision due. 

Eyes of glass, with optic axes 
Twisting rays of light as flax is 
Twisted, while the Parallax is 
      Made to show the real size. 
Primary and secondary 
Focal lines in planes contrary, 
Sum up all that’s known to vary 
      In those dull, unmeaning eyes. 

Such the eyes, through which all Nature 
Seems reduced to meaner stature. 
If you had them you would hate your 
      Symbolising sense of sight. 
Seeing planets in their courses 
Thick beset with arrowy “forces,” 
While the common eye no more sees 
      Than their mild and quiet light. 

“Son,” she said (what could be queerer 
Than thus tête-a -tête to hear her 
Talk, in tones approaching nearer 
      To a saw’s than aught beside? 
For the voice the spectre spoke in 
Might be known by many a token 
To proceed from metal, broken 
      When acoustic tricks were tried. 

Little pleased to hear the Siren 
“Own” me thus with voice of iron, 
I had thoughts of just retiring 
      From a mother such a fright). 
“No,” she said, “the time is pressing, 
So before I give my blessing, 
I’ll excuse you from confessing 
      What you thought of me to-night. 

“Powers!” she cried, with hoarse devotion, 
“Give my son the clearest notion 
How to compass sure promotion, 
      And take care of Number One. 
Let his college course be pleasant, 
Let him ever, as at present, 
Seem to have read what he hasn’t, 
      And to do what can’t be done. 

Of the Philosophic Spirit 
Richly may my son inherit; 
As for Poetry, inter it 
      With the myths of other days. 
Cut the thing entirely, lest yon 
College Don should put the question, 
Why not stick to what you’re best on? 
      Mathematics always pays.” 

As the Hag was thus proceeding 
To prescribe my course of reading, 
And as I was faintly pleading, 
      Hardly knowing what to say, 
Suddenly, my head inclining 
I beheld a light form shining; 
And the withered beldam, whining, 
      Saw the same and slunk away. 

Then the vision, growing brighter, 
Seemed to make my garret lighter; 
As when noisome fogs of night are 
      Scattered by the rising sun. 
Nearer still it grew and nearer, 
Till my straining eyes caught clearer 
Glimpses of a being dearer, 
      Dearer still than Number One. 

In that well-remembered Vision 
I was led to the decision 
Still to hold in calm derision 
      Pedantry, however draped; 
Since that artificial spectre 
Proved a paltry sub-collector, 
And had nothing to connect her 
      With the being whom she aped. 

I could never finish telling 
You of her that has her dwelling 
Where those springs of truth are welling, 
      Whence all streams of beauty run. 
She has taught me that creation 
Bears the test of calculation, 
But that Man forgets his station 
      If he stops when that is done. 

Is our algebra the measure 
Of that unexhausted treasure 
That affords the purest pleasure, 
      Ever found when it is sought? 
Let us rather, realising 
The conclusions thence arising 
Nature more than symbols prizing, 
      Learn to worship as we ought. 

Worship? Yes, what worship better 
Than when free’d from every fetter 
That the uninforming letter 
      Rivets on the tortured mind, 
Man, with silent admiration 
Sees the glories of Creation, 
And, in holy contemplation, 
      Leaves the learned crowd behind!"
598,A Vision of Poesy,Henry Timrod,"PART I 

       I 
In a far country, and a distant age, 
   Ere sprites and fays had bade farewell to earth,  
A boy was born of humble parentage; 
   The stars that shone upon his lonely birth  
Did seem to promise sovereignty and fame— 
Yet no tradition hath preserved his name. 

       II 
’T is said that on the night when he was born, 
   A beauteous shape swept slowly through the room;  
Its eyes broke on the infant like a morn, 
   And his cheek brightened like a rose in bloom;  
But as it passed away there followed after  
A sigh of pain, and sounds of elvish laughter. 

       III 
And so his parents deemed him to be blest 
   Beyond the lot of mortals; they were poor  
As the most timid bird that stored its nest 
   With the stray gleanings at their cottage-door:  
Yet they contrived to rear their little dove,  
And he repaid them with the tenderest love. 

       IV 
The child was very beautiful in sooth, 
   And as he waxed in years grew lovelier still;  
On his fair brow the aureole of truth 
   Beamed, and the purest maidens, with a thrill,  
Looked in his eyes, and from their heaven of blue  
Saw thoughts like sinless Angels peering through. 

       V 
Need there was none of censure or of praise 
   To mould him to the kind parental hand;  
Yet there was ever something in his ways, 
   Which those about him could not understand;  
A self-withdrawn and independent bliss, 
Beside the father’s love, the mother’s kiss. 

       VI 
For oft, when he believed himself alone, 
   They caught brief snatches of mysterious rhymes, 
Which he would murmur in an undertone, 
   Like a pleased bee’s in summer; and at times  
A strange far look would come into his eyes,  
As if he saw a vision in the skies. 

       VII 
And he upon a simple leaf would pore  
   As if its very texture unto him 
Had some deep meaning; sometimes by the door, 
   From noon until a summer-day grew dim, 
He lay and watched the clouds; and to his thought  
Night with her stars but fitful slumbers brought. 

       VIII 
In the long hours of twilight, when the breeze 
   Talked in low tones along the woodland rills,  
Or the loud North its stormy minstrelsies 
   Blent with wild noises from the distant hills,  
The boy—his rosy hand against his ear  
Curved like a sea-shell—hushed as some rapt seer, 

       IX 
Followed the sounds, and ever and again, 
   As the wind came, and went, in storm or play,  
He seemed to hearken as to some far strain 
   Of mingled voices calling him away; 
And they who watched him held their breath to trace  
The still and fixed attention in his face. 

       X 
Once, on a cold and loud-voiced winter night, 
   The three were seated by their cottage-fire— 
The mother watching by its flickering light 
   The wakeful urchin, and the dozing sire;  
There was a brief, quick motion like a bird’s,  
And the boy’s thought thus rippled into words: 

       XI 
“O mother! thou hast taught me many things, 
   But none I think more beautiful than speech— 
A nobler power than even those broad wings 
   I used to pray for, when I longed to reach 
That distant peak which on our vale looks down,  
And wears the star of evening for a crown.  

       XII 
“But, mother, while our human words are rife 
   To us with meaning, other sounds there be  
Which seem, and are, the language of a life 
   Around, yet unlike ours: winds talk; the sea  
Murmurs articulately, and the sky 
Listens, and answers, though inaudibly.  

       XIII 
“By stream and spring, in glades and woodlands lone, 
   Beside our very cot, I’ve gathered flowers  
Inscribed with signs and characters unknown; 
   But the frail scrolls still baffle all my powers:  
What is this language and where is the key  
That opes its weird and wondrous mystery? 

       XIV 
“The forests know it, and the mountains know,  
   And it is written in the sunset’s dyes;  
A revelation to the world below 
   Is daily going on before our eyes; 
And, but for sinful thoughts, I do not doubt  
That we could spell the thrilling secret out.  

       XV 
“O mother! somewhere on this lovely earth 
   I lived, and understood that mystic tongue,  
But, for some reason, to my second birth 
   Only the dullest memories have clung,  
Like that fair tree that even while blossoming  
Keeps the dead berries of a former spring. 

       XVI 
“Who shall put life in these?—my nightly dreams 
   Some teacher of supernal powers foretell; 
A fair and stately shape appears, which seems 
   Bright with all truth; and once, in a dark dell  
Within the forest, unto me there came 
A voice that must be hers, which called my name.” 

       XVII 
Puzzled and frightened, wondering more and more,  
   The mother heard, but did not comprehend; 
“So early dallying with forbidden lore! 
   Oh, what will chance, and wherein will it end?  
My child! my child!” she caught him to her breast,  
“Oh, let me kiss these wildering thoughts to rest! 

       XVIII 
“They cannot come from God, who freely gives 
   All that we need to have, or ought to know;  
Beware, my son! some evil influence strives 
   To grieve thy parents, and to work thee woe;  
Alas! the vision I misunderstood! 
It could not be an angel fair and good.”  

       XIX 
And then, in low and tremulous tones, she told 
   The story of his birth-night; the boy’s eyes,  
As the wild tale went on, were bright and bold, 
   With a weird look that did not seem surprise:  
“Perhaps,” he said, “this lady and her elves  
Will one day come, and take me to themselves.” 

       XX 
“And would’st thou leave us?” “Dearest mother, no! 
   Hush! I will check these thoughts that give thee pain;  
Or, if they flow, as they perchance must flow, 
   At least I will not utter them again; 
Hark! didst thou hear a voice like many streams?  
Mother! it is the spirit of my dreams!” 

       XXI 
Thenceforth, whatever impulse stirred below, 
   In the deep heart beneath that childish breast,  
Those lips were sealed, and though the eye would glow, 
   Yet the brow wore an air of perfect rest;  
Cheerful, content, with calm though strong control,  
He shut the temple-portals of his soul. 

       XXII 
And when too restlessly the mighty throng 
   Of fancies woke within his teeming mind,  
All silently they formed in glorious song, 
   And floated off unheard, and undivined,  
Perchance not lost—with many a voiceless prayer  
They reached the sky, and found some record there. 

       XXIII 
Softly and swiftly sped the quiet days; 
   The thoughtful boy has blossomed into youth,  
And still no maiden would have feared his gaze, 
   And still his brow was noble with the truth:  
Yet though he masks the pain with pious art  
There burns a restless fever in his heart. 

       XXIV 
A childish dream is now a deathless need 
   Which drives him to far hills and distant wilds;  
The solemn faith and fervor of his creed 
   Bold as a martyr’s, simple as a child’s;  
The eagle knew him as she knew the blast,  
And the deer did not flee him as he passed. 

       XXV 
But gentle even in his wildest mood, 
   Always, and most, he loved the bluest weather,  
And in some soft and sunny solitude 
   Couched like a milder sunshine on the heather,  
He communed with the winds, and with the birds,  
As if they might have answered him in words. 

       XXVI 
Deep buried in the forest was a nook, 
   Remote and quiet as its quiet skies; 
He knew it, sought it, loved it as a book 
   Full of his own sweet thoughts and memories;  
Dark oaks and fluted chestnuts gathering round,  
Pillared and greenly domed a sloping mound, 

       XXVII 
Whereof—white, purple, azure, golden, red, 
   Confused like hues of sunset—the wild flowers  
Wove a rich dais; through crosslights overhead 
   Glanced the clear sunshine, fell the fruitful showers, 
And here the shyest bird would fold her wings;  
Here fled the fairest and the gentlest things.  

       XXVIII 
Thither, one night of mist and moonlight, came  
   The youth, with nothing deeper in his thoughts  
Than to behold beneath the silver flame 
   New aspects of his fair and favorite spot;  
A single ray attained the ground, and shed 
Just light enough to guide the wanderer’s tread. 

       XXIX 
And high and hushed arose the stately trees, 
   Yet shut within themselves, like dungeons, where  
Lay fettered all the secrets of the breeze; 
   Silent, but not as slumbering, all things there  
Wore to the youth’s aroused imagination  
An air of deep and solemn expectation. 

       XXX 
“Hath Heaven,” the youth exclaimed, “a sweeter spot, 
   Or Earth another like it?—yet even here 
The old mystery dwells! and though I read it not, 
   Here most I hope—it is, or seems so near;  
So many hints come to me, but, alas! 
I cannot grasp the shadows as they pass. 

       XXXI 
“Here, from the very turf beneath me, I 
   Catch, but just catch, I know not what faint sound,  
And darkly guess that from yon silent sky 
   Float starry emanations to the ground;  
These ears are deaf, these human eyes are blind,  
I want a purer heart, a subtler mind. 

       XXXII 
“Sometimes—could it be fancy?—I have felt  
   The presence of a spirit who might speak;  
As down in lowly reverence I knelt, 
   Its very breath has kissed my burning cheek;  
But I in vain have hushed my own to hear 
A wing or whisper stir the silent air!” 

       XXXIII 
Is not the breeze articulate? Hark! Oh, hark! 
   A distant murmur, like a voice of floods; 
And onward sweeping slowly through the dark, 
   Bursts like a call the night-wind from the woods!  
Low bow the flowers, the trees fling loose their dreams,  
And through the waving roof a fresher moonlight streams. 

       XXXIV 
“Mortal!”—the word crept slowly round the place 
   As if that wind had breathed it! From no star  
Streams that soft lustre on the dreamer’s face. 
   Again a hushing calm! while faint and far 
The breeze goes calling onward through the night.  
Dear God! what vision chains that wide-strained sight? 

       XXXV 
Over the grass and flowers, and up the slope 
   Glides a white cloud of mist, self-moved and slow,  
That, pausing at the hillock’s moonlit cope, 
   Swayed like a flame of silver; from below 
The breathless youth with beating heart beholds  
A mystic motion in its argent folds. 

       XXXVI 
Yet his young soul is bold, and hope grows warm, 
   As flashing through that cloud of shadowy crape,  
With sweep of robes, and then a gleaming arm, 
   Slowly developing, at last took shape 
A face and form unutterably bright, 
That cast a golden glamour on the night.  

       XXXVII 
But for the glory round it it would seem 
   Almost a mortal maiden; and the boy,  
Unto whom love was yet an innocent dream, 
   Shivered and crimsoned with an unknown joy; 
As to the young Spring bounds the passionate South,  
He could have clasped and kissed her mouth to mouth. 

       XXXVIII 
Yet something checked, that was and was not dread, 
   Till in a low sweet voice the maiden spake;  
She was the Fairy of his dreams, she said, 
   And loved him simply for his human sake;  
And that in heaven, wherefrom she took her birth,  
They called her Poesy, the angel of the earth. 

       XXXIX 
“And ever since that immemorial hour, 
   When the glad morning-stars together sung,  
My task hath been, beneath a mightier Power,  
   To keep the world forever fresh and young; 
I give it not its fruitage and its green, 
But clothe it with a glory all unseen. 

       XL 
“I sow the germ which buds in human art, 
   And, with my sister, Science, I explore  
With light the dark recesses of the heart, 
   And nerve the will, and teach the wish to soar;  
I touch with grace the body’s meanest clay,  
While noble souls are nobler for my sway. 

       XLI 
“Before my power the kings of earth have bowed; 
   I am the voice of Freedom, and the sword  
Leaps from its scabbard when I call aloud; 
   Wherever life in sacrifice is poured, 
Wherever martyrs die or patriots bleed, 
I weave the chaplet and award the meed. 

       XLII 
“Where Passion stoops, or strays, is cold, or dead,  
   I lift from error, or to action thrill! 
Or if it rage too madly in its bed, 
   The tempest hushes at my ‘peace! be still!’ 
I know how far its tides should sink or swell,  
And they obey my sceptre and my spell. 

       XLIII 
“All lovely things, and gentle—the sweet laugh  
   Of children, Girlhood’s kiss, and Friendship’s clasp, 
The boy that sporteth with the old man’s staff,  
   The baby, and the breast its fingers grasp— 
All that exalts the grounds of happiness, 
All griefs that hallow, and all joys that bless,  

       XLIV 
“To me are sacred; at my holy shrine 
   Love breathes its latest dreams, its earliest hints;  
I turn life’s tasteless waters into wine, 
   And flush them through and through with purple tints. 
Wherever Earth is fair, and Heaven looks down,  
I rear my altars, and I wear my crown. 

       XLV 
“I am the unseen spirit thou hast sought, 
   I woke those shadowy questionings that vex  
Thy young mind, lost in its own cloud of thought, 
   And rouse the soul they trouble and perplex;  
I filled thy days with visions, and thy nights  
Blessed with all sweetest sounds and fairy sights. 

       XLVI 
“Not here, not in this world, may I disclose 
   The mysteries in which this life is hearsed;  
Some doubts there be that, with some earthly woes, 
   By Death alone shall wholly be dispersed;  
Yet on those very doubts from this low sod  
Thy soul shall pass beyond the stars to God. 

       XLVII 
“And so to knowledge, climbing grade by grade, 
   Thou shalt attain whatever mortals can,  
And what thou may’st discover by my aid 
   Thou shalt translate unto thy brother man;  
And men shall bless the power that flings a ray  
Into their night from thy diviner day. 

       XLVIII 
“For from thy lofty height, thy words shall fall 
   Upon their spirits, like bright cataracts  
That front a sunrise; thou shalt hear them call 
   Amid their endless waste of arid facts,  
As wearily they plod their way along,  
Upon the rhythmic zephyrs of thy song. 

       XLIX 
“All this is in thy reach, but much depends  
   Upon thyself—thy future I await; 
I give the genius, point the proper ends,  
   But the true bard is his own only Fate;  
Into thy soul my soul have I infused; 
Take care thy lofty powers be wisely used.  

       L 
“The Poet owes a high and holy debt, 
   Which, if he feel, he craves not to be heard  
For the poor boon of praise, or place, nor yet  
   Does the mere joy of song, as with the bird 
Of many voices, prompt the choral lay 
That cheers that gentle pilgrim on his way. 

       LI 
“Nor may he always sweep the passionate lyre,  
   Which is his heart, only for such relief  
As an impatient spirit may desire, 
   Lest, from the grave which hides a private grief,  
The spells of song call up some pallid wraith  
To blast or ban a mortal hope or faith. 

       LII 
“Yet over his deep soul, with all its crowd 
   Of varying hopes and fears, he still must brood;  
As from its azure height a tranquil cloud 
   Watches its own bright changes in the flood;  
Self-reading, not self-loving—they are twain— 
And sounding, while he mourns, the depths of pain. 

       LIII 
“Thus shall his songs attain the common breast, 
   Dyed in his own life’s blood, the sign and seal,  
Even as the thorns which are the martyr’s crest, 
   That do attest his office, and appeal 
Unto the universal human heart 
In sanction of his mission and his art. 

       LIV 
“Much yet remains unsaid—pure must he be; 
   Oh, blessed are the pure! for they shall hear 
Where others hear not, see where others see 
   With a dazed vision: who have drawn most near  
My shrine, have ever brought a spirit cased  
And mailed in a body clean and chaste. 

       LV 
“The Poet to the whole wide world belongs, 
   Even as the teacher is the child’s—I said  
No selfish aim should ever mar his songs, 
   But self wears many guises; men may wed  
Self in another, and the soul may be  
Self to its centre, all unconsciously. 

       LVI 
“And therefore must the Poet watch, lest he,  
   In the dark struggle of this life, should take 
Stains which he might not notice; he must flee 
   Falsehood, however winsome, and forsake  
All for the Truth, assured that Truth alone  
Is Beauty, and can make him all my own. 

       LVII 
“And he must be as armed warrior strong,  
   And he must be as gentle as a girl, 
And he must front, and sometimes suffer wrong, 
   With brow unbent, and lip untaught to curl;  
For wrath, and scorn, and pride, however just,  
Fill the clear spirit’s eyes with earthly dust.” 

       * 

The story came to me—it recks not whence— 
In fragments. Oh! if I could tell it all, 
If human speech indeed could tell it all,  
’T were not a whit less wondrous, than if I  
Should find, untouched in leaf and stem, and bright  
As when it bloomed three thousand years ago  
On some Idalian slope, a perfect rose.  
Alas! a leaf or two, and they perchance  
Scarce worth the hiving, one or two dead leaves  
Are the sole harvest of a summer’s toil.  
There was a moment, ne’er to be recalled,  
When to the Poet’s hope within my heart,  
They wore a tint like life’s, but in my hand,  
I know not why, they withered. I have heard  
Somewhere, of some dead monarch, from the tomb  
Where he had slept a century and more,  
Brought forth, that when the coffin was laid bare,  
Albeit the body in its mouldering robes  
Was fleshless, yet one feature still remained  
Perfect, or perfect seemed at least; the eyes  
Gleamed for a second on the startled crowd,  
And then went out in ashes. Even thus  
The story, when I drew it from the grave  
Where it had lain so long, did seem, I thought,  
Not wholly lifeless; but even while I gazed  
To fix its features on my heart, and called  
The world to wonder with me, lo! it proved  
I looked upon a corpse! 
                                    What further fell 
In that lone forest nook, how much was taught,  
How much was only hinted, what the youth  
Promised, if promise were required, to do  
Or strive for, what the gifts he bore away— 
Or added powers or blessings—how at last,  
The vision ended and he sought his home, 
How lived there, and how long, and when he passed  
Into the busy world to seek his fate,  
I know not, and if any ever knew,  
The tale hath perished from the earth; for here  
The slender thread on which my song is strung  
Breaks off, and many after-years of life  
Are lost to sight, the life to reappear  
Only toward its close—as of a dream  
We catch the end, and opening, but forget  
That which had joined them in the dreaming brain; 
Or as a mountain with a belt of mist  
That shows his base, and far above, a peak  
With a blue plume of pines. 
                                          But turn the page  
And read the only hints that yet remain. 

       PART II 

       I 
It is not winter yet, but that sweet time 
   In autumn when the first cool days are past;  
A week ago, the leaves were hoar with rime, 
   And some have dropped before the North wind’s blast; 
But the mild hours are back, and at mid-noon,  
The day hath all the genial warmth of June.  

       II 
What slender form lies stretched along the mound? 
   Can it be his, the Wanderer’s, with that brow  
Gray in its prime, those eyes that wander round 
   Listlessly, with a jaded glance that now  
Seems to see nothing where it rests, and then  
Pores on each trivial object in its ken? 

       III 
See how a gentle maid’s wan fingers clasp 
   The last fond love-notes of some faithless hand;  
Thus with a transient interest, his weak grasp 
   Holds a few leaves as when of old he scanned  
The meaning in their gold and crimson streaks,  
But the sweet dream has vanished! hush! he speaks! 

       IV 
“Once more, once more, after long pain and toil, 
   And yet not long, if I should count by years,  
I breathe my native air, and tread the soil 
   I trod in childhood; if I shed no tears, 
No happy tears, ’t is that their fount is dry,  
And joy that cannot weep must sigh, must sigh. 

       V 
“These leaves, my boyish books in days of yore, 
   When, as the weeks sped by, I seemed to stand  
Ever upon the brink of some wild lore, 
   These leaves shall make my bed, and—for the hand  
Of God is on me, chilling brain and breath— 
I shall not ask a softer couch in death. 

       VI 
“Here was it that I saw, or dreamed I saw, 
   I know not which, that shape of love and light.  
Spirit of Song! have I not owned thy law? 
   Have I not taught, or striven to teach the right,  
And kept my heart as clean, my life as sweet,  
As mortals may, when mortals mortals meet? 

       VII 
“Thou know’st how I went forth, my youthful breast 
   On fire with thee, amid the paths of men;  
Once in my wanderings, my lone footsteps pressed 
   A mountain forest; in a sombre glen, 
Down which its thunderous boom a cataract flung,  
A little bird, unheeded, built and sung. 

       VIII 
“So fell my voice amid the whirl and rush  
   Of human passions; if unto my art 
Sorrow hath sometimes owed a gentler gush,  
   I know it not; if any Poet-heart 
Hath kindled at my songs its light divine,  
I know it not; no ray came back to mine.  

       IX 
“Alone in crowds, once more I sought to make 
   Of senseless things my friends; the clouds that burn 
Above the sunset, and the flowers that shake 
   Their odors in the wind—these would not turn  
Their faces from me; far from cities, I  
Forgot the scornful world that passed me by. 

       X 
“Yet even the world’s cold slights I might have borne, 
   Nor fled, though sorrowing; but I shrank at last 
When one sweet face, too sweet, I thought, for scorn, 
   Looked scornfully upon me; then I passed 
From all that youth had dreamed or manhood planned,  
Into the self that none would understand. 

       XI 
“She was—I never wronged her womanhood 
   By crowning it with praises not her own— 
She was all earth’s, and earth’s, too, in that mood 
   When she brings forth her fairest; I atone  
Now, in this fading brow and failing frame,  
That such a soul such soul as mine could tame. 

       XII 
“Clay to its kindred clay! I loved in sooth 
   Too deeply and too purely to be blest;  
With something more of lust and less of truth 
   She would have sunk all blushes on my breast,  
And—but I must not blame her—in my ear  
Death whispers! and the end, thank God! draws near!” 

       XIII 
Hist! on the perfect silence of the place 
   Comes and dies off a sound like far-off rain  
With voices mingled; on the Poet’s face 
   A shadow, where no shadow should have lain,  
Falls the next moment: nothing meets his sight,  
Yet something moves betwixt him and the light. 

       XIV 
And a voice murmurs, “Wonder not, but hear! 
   Me to behold again thou need’st not seek;  
Yet by the dim-felt influence on the air, 
   And by the mystic shadow on thy cheek, 
Know, though thou may’st not touch with fleshly hands,  
The genius of thy life beside thee stands! 

       XV 
“Unto no fault, O weary-hearted one! 
   Unto no fault of man’s thou ow’st thy fate;  
All human hearts that beat this earth upon, 
   All human thoughts and human passions wait  
Upon the genuine bard, to him belong,  
And help in their own way the Poet’s song. 

       XVI 
“How blame the world? for the world hast thou wrought? 
   Or wast thou but as one who aims to fling  
The weight of some unutterable thought 
   Down like a burden? what from questioning  
Too subtly thy own spirit, and to speech  
But half subduing themes beyond the reach 

       XVII 
“Of mortal reason; what from living much 
   In that dark world of shadows, where the soul  
Wanders bewildered, striving still to clutch, 
   Yet never clutching once, a shadowy goal,  
Which always flies, and while it flies seems near,  
Thy songs were riddles hard to mortal ear. 

       XVIII 
“This was the hidden selfishness that marred 
   Thy teachings ever; this the false key-note  
That on such souls as might have loved thee jarred 
   Like an unearthly language; thou did’st float  
On a strange water; those who stood on land  
Gazed, but they could not leave their beaten strand. 

       XIX 
“Your elements were different, and apart— 
   The world’s and thine—and even in those intense  
And watchful broodings o’er thy inmost heart, 
   It was thy own peculiar difference 
That thou did’st seek; nor did’st thou care to find  
Aught that would bring thee nearer to thy kind.  

       XX 
“Not thus the Poet, who in blood and brain 
   Would represent his race and speak for all,  
Weaves the bright woof of that impassioned strain 
   Which drapes, as if for some high festival  
Of pure delights—whence few of human birth  
May rightly be shut out—the common earth. 

       XXI 
“As the same law that moulds a planet, rounds 
   A drop of dew, so the great Poet spheres  
Worlds in himself; no selfish limit bounds 
   A sympathy that folds all characters,  
All ranks, all passions, and all life almost  
In its wide circle. Like some noble host, 

       XXII 
“He spreads the riches of his soul, and bids 
   Partake who will. Age has its saws of truth,  
And love is for the maiden’s drooping lids, 
   And words of passion for the earnest youth;  
Wisdom for all; and when it seeks relief,  
Tears, and their solace for the heart of grief. 

       XXIII 
“Nor less on him than thee, the mysteries 
   Within him and about him ever weigh— 
The meanings in the stars, and in the breeze, 
   All the weird wonders of the common day,  
Truths that the merest point removes from reach,  
And thoughts that pause upon the brink of speech; 

       XXIV 
“But on the surface of his song, these lie 
   As shadows, not as darkness; and alway, 
Even though it breathe the secrets of the sky, 
   There is a human purpose in the lay;  
As some tall fir that whispers to the stars  
Shields at its base a cotter’s lattice-bars. 

       XXV 
“Even such my Poet! for thou still art mine! 
   Thou might’st have been, and now have calmly died,  
A priest, and not a victim at the shrine;  
   Alas! yet was it all thy fault? I chide, 
Perchance, myself within thee, and the fate  
To which thy power was solely consecrate.  

       XXVI 
“Thy life hath not been wholly without use, 
   Albeit that use is partly hidden now;  
In thy unmingled scorn of any truce 
   With this world’s specious falsehoods, often thou  
Hast uttered, through some all unworldly song,  
Truths that for man might else have slumbered long. 

       XXVII 
“And these not always vainly on the crowd 
   Have fallen; some are cherished now, and some,  
In mystic phrases wrapped as in a shroud, 
   Wait the diviner, who as yet is dumb 
Upon the breast of God—the gate of birth  
Closed on a dreamless ignorance of earth. 

       XXVIII 
“And therefore, though thy name shall pass away, 
   Even as a cloud that hath wept all its showers,  
Yet as that cloud shall live again one day 
   In the glad grass, and in the happy flowers, 
So in thy thoughts, though clothed in sweeter rhymes,  
Thy life shall bear its flowers in future times.”"
599,A Vision of the Bodhisattvas,Philip Whalen,"They pass before me one by one riding on animals
""What are you waiting for,"" they want to know

Z—, young as he is (& mad into the bargain) tells me
""Some day you'll drop everything & become a rishi, you know.""

I know
The forest is there, I've lived in it
    More certainly than this town? Irrelevant—

    What am I waiting for?
A change in customs that will take 1000 years to come about?
Who's to make the change but me?

    ""Returning again and again,"" Amida says

Why's that dream so necessary? walking out of whatever house alone
Nothing but the clothes on my back, money or no
Down the road to the next place the highway leading to the   
mountains
From which I absolutely must come back

What business have I to do that?
I know the world and I love it too much and it
Is not the one I'd find outside this door."
600,A Vision upon the Fairy Queen,Sir Walter Raleigh,"Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,
   Within that temple where the vestal flame
   Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,
   To see that buried dust of living fame,
Whose tomb fair Love, and fairer Virtue kept:
   All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;
   At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept,
  And, from thenceforth, those Graces were not seen:
For they this queen attended; in whose stead
   Oblivion laid him down on Laura’s hearse:
   Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:
   Where Homer’s spright did tremble all for grief,
   And cursed the access of that celestial thief!"
601,A Visit,Tom Sleigh,"What she is waiting for never arrives
or arrives so slowly she can't see it:
Like the river
bluing silver

and wearing minutely deeper into its channel,
the flow hardens to carved stone as she fidgets
beneath the whirling fan
impatient for the train

that rocks us above the water to arrive:
Her sisters and brothers gone, she ventures alone
through sunlight
and moonlight

weaving shadowy faces across the peeling walls...
—Speeding toward her, is it you and me she spies
in the trembling train
windows while the engine

hauls us down rails that swerve under wheels
rolling through her brain? Faces burn
through dirty glass,
smears of lips and eyes

dissolve to spots of darkness swarming between
her eyes so that swaying apartment towers
crumble as her nostrils
prickle from the landfill's

ammonia that hangs above the stacked, crushed cars.
The rails that take us to her pass boxcar after boxcar
like the successive selves we are
as she dreams us coming closer,

switching track to track: Now the super unbolts
her door as she calls: “Oh is it really you?”
—the wheel's rolling
through her head bringing

us face to face with raveled bandages, crutches
leaned in dusty corners, terraced mountains of
yellowing newspaper.
Framed above her chair

a picture of a prairie sprawls round a covered wagon
and the horse she rode as a girl, her eyes
fading points of light...
Again she calls out

above the train's approaching rumble: “Is it you at last?”
My eyes have got so bad peoples’ faces
are all blurry...Now
tell me, is it really you?”

But already the rails are switching, bearing
our waving hands away at the speed of thought
over the stony waters that
ceaselessly pour out."
602,The Visitation,Samuel Menashe,"His body ahead
Of him on the bed
He faces his feet
Sees himself dead,
A corpse complete
With legs and chest
And belly between
Swelling the scene
Of the crime you left,
Taking your time,
Angel of Death"
603,Visiting a dead man on a summer day,Marge Piercy,"In flat America, in Chicago,
Graceland cemetery on the German North Side.
Forty feet of Corinthian candle
celebrate Pullman embedded
lonely raisin in a cake of concrete.
The Potter Palmers float
in an island parthenon.
Barons of hogfat, railroads and wheat
are postmarked with angels and lambs.

But the Getty tomb: white, snow patterned
in a triangle of trees swims dappled with leaf shadow,
sketched light arch within arch
delicate as fingernail moons.

The green doors should not be locked.
Doors of fern and flower should not be shut.
Louis Sullivan, I sit on your grave.
 It is not now good weather for prophets.
Sun eddies on the steelsmoke air like sinking honey.

On the inner green door of the Getty tomb
(a thighbone's throw from your stone)
a marvel of growing, blooming, thrusting into seed:
how all living wreathe and insinuate
in the circlet of repetition that never repeats:
 ever new birth never rebirth.
Each tide pool microcosm spiraling from your hand.

Sullivan, you had another five years
when your society would give you work.
Thirty years with want crackling in your hands.
Thirty after years with cities
flowering and turning grey in your beard.

All poets are unemployed nowadays.
My country marches in its sleep.
The past structures a heavy mausoleum
hiding its iron frame in masonry.
Men burn like grass
while armies grow.

Thirty years in the vast rumbling gut
of this society you stormed
to be used, screamed
no louder than any other breaking voice.
The waste of a good man
bleeds the future that's come
in Chicago, in flat America,
where the poor still bleed from the teeth,
housed in sewers and filing cabinets,
where prophets may spit into the wind
till anger sleets their eyes shut,
where this house that dances the seasons
and the braid of all living
and the joy of a man making his new good thing
is strange, irrelevant as a meteor,
in Chicago, in flat America
in this year of our burning."
604,Vita Nova,Louise Glück,"You saved me, you should remember me.

The spring of the year; young men buying tickets for the ferryboats.
Laughter, because the air is full of apple blossoms.

When I woke up, I realized I was capable of the same feeling.

I remember sounds like that from my childhood,   
laughter for no cause, simply because the world is beautiful,
something like that.

Lugano. Tables under the apple trees.
Deckhands raising and lowering the colored flags.
And by the lake’s edge, a young man throws his hat into the water;
perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him.

Crucial
sounds or gestures like
a track laid down before the larger themes

and then unused, buried.

Islands in the distance. My mother   
holding out a plate of little cakes—

as far as I remember, changed
in no detail, the moment
vivid, intact, having never been
exposed to light, so that I woke elated, at my age   
hungry for life, utterly confident—

By the tables, patches of new grass, the pale green   
pieced into the dark existing ground.

Surely spring has been returned to me, this time   
not as a lover but a messenger of death, yet   
it is still spring, it is still meant tenderly."
605,Vobiscum Est Iope,Thomas Campion,"When thou must home to shades of underground,
And there arrived, a new admirèd guest,
The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,
White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,
To hear the stories of thy finished love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;

Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,
Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,
Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,
And all these triumphs for thy beauty’s sake:
When thou hast told these honours done to thee,
Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!"
606,Voices from the Other World,James Merrill,"Presently at our touch the teacup stirred,   
Then circled lazily about
From A to Z. The first voice heard
(If they are voices, these mute spellers-out)   
Was that of an engineer

Originally from Cologne.
Dead in his 22nd year
Of cholera in Cairo, he had KNOWN
NO HAPPINESS. He once met Goethe, though.   
Goethe had told him: PERSEVERE.

Our blind hound whined. With that, a horde   
Of voices gathered above the Ouija board,   
Some childish and, you might say, blurred   
By sleep; one little boy
Named Will, reluctant possibly in a ruff

Like a large-lidded page out of El Greco, pulled   
Back the arras for that next voice,   
Cold and portentous: ALL IS LOST.
FLEE THIS HOUSE. OTTO VON THURN UND TAXIS.   
OBEY. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

Frightened, we stopped; but tossed
Till sunrise striped the rumpled sheets with gold.
Each night since then, the moon waxes,   
Small insects flit round a cold torch
We light, that sends them pattering to the porch . . .

But no real Sign. New voices come,
Dictate addresses, begging us to write;
Some warn of lives misspent, and all of doom   
In ways that so exhilarate
We are sleeping sound of late.

Last night the teacup shattered in a rage.   
Indeed, we have grown nonchalant
Towards the other world. In the gloom here,   
our elbows on the cleared
Table, we talk and smoke, pleased to be stirred

Rather by buzzings in the jasmine, by the drone
Of our own voices and poor blind Rover’s wheeze,   
Than by those clamoring overhead,
Obsessed or piteous, for a commitment
We still have wit to postpone

Because, once looked at lit
By the cold reflections of the dead
Risen extinct but irresistible,
Our lives have never seemed more full, more real,   
Nor the full moon more quick to chill."
607,Voices of the Air,Katherine Mansfield,"But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.

The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats—

The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these—

For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes."
608,Voyage,Samuel Menashe,"Water opens without end
At the bow of the ship
Rising to descend
Away from it

Days become one
I am who I was"
609,Wac-A-Mole Realism™,Matthea Harvey,"At the carnival, Robo-Boy sees only things he recognizes. The Ferris Wheel is an overgrown version of his own bells and whistle eyes. His Flashers, his mother calls them. The Tilt-A-Whirl is the angle his head tilts when the Flirt Program goes into effect, usually in the vicinity of a Cindy or a Carrie, though once he found himself tilting at the school librarian which caused him to wheel in reverse into the Civil War section knocking over a cart of books that were waiting to be shelved under B. There’s a dangerously low stratosphere of pink cotton-candy clouds being carried around by the children. If Robo-Boy goes near them, the alarms will go off. It’s the kind of sticky that would cause joint-lock for sure. In a darker, safer corner Robo-Boy finds the Whack-A-Mole game. He pays a dollar and starts whacking the plastic moles on their heads each time they pop up from the much-dented log. He wins bear after bear. It’s only when he's lugging them home, the largest one skidding face-down along the sidewalk getting dirt on its white nose and light blue belly, that he remembers the program: Wac-A-Mole Realism™—the disc on the installer’s desk. Suddenly it all fits together: the way a deliciously strange thought will start wafting out of his unconscious—and then WHAM, it disappears."
610,Waiting for the Barbarians,C. P. Cavafy,"What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?

      The barbarians are due here today.

Why isn’t anything going on in the senate?
Why are the senators sitting there without legislating?

      Because the barbarians are coming today.
      What’s the point of senators making laws now?
      Once the barbarians are here, they’ll do the legislating.

Why did our emperor get up so early,
and why is he sitting enthroned at the city’s main gate,
in state, wearing the crown?

      Because the barbarians are coming today
      and the emperor’s waiting to receive their leader.
      He’s even got a scroll to give him,
      loaded with titles, with imposing names.

Why have our two consuls and praetors come out today
wearing their embroidered, their scarlet togas?
Why have they put on bracelets with so many amethysts,
rings sparkling with magnificent emeralds?
Why are they carrying elegant canes
beautifully worked in silver and gold?

      Because the barbarians are coming today
      and things like that dazzle the barbarians.

Why don’t our distinguished orators turn up as usual
to make their speeches, say what they have to say?

      Because the barbarians are coming today
      and they’re bored by rhetoric and public speaking.

Why this sudden bewilderment, this confusion?
(How serious people’s faces have become.)
Why are the streets and squares emptying so rapidly,
everyone going home lost in thought?

      Because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come.
      And some of our men just in from the border say
      there are no barbarians any longer.

Now what’s going to happen to us without barbarians?
Those people were a kind of solution."
611,Waiting There,Michael Anania,"As others or ourselves
let’s say—furtive, then,

inconsequent and sad—
or on the edge of thought,

perhaps, or into some
predictable meandering,

the outward accelerations
of water against its shore

dissipating into erosions,
cuts and counter-cuts,

remembered as landscape,
the convenient certainties

of an abandoned past.
Is it tree or treeline

or the massing of leaves
against the sky or color

freed from shadow or something
of color deepening against shade,

the sensible bluff that heaves
above the bluff’s presumed

insensible marl? River,
again, always enclosed

by its own turnings, its
own turnings overgrown."
612,Waking,Carol Frost,"It was dusk, the light hesitating
and a murmer in the wind, when the deer, exhausted,
turned to look at me, an arrow in its side.

Though I pity dreamers, taking a thread
and weaving it upon the loom of Self—the secret,
gaudy, wonderful new cloth—, I will tell the end of the story.

His shoulder was torn, the joint held by one sinew,
which I severed with the blade of the arrow,
so when he ran there were no impediments.

The black dogs that followed were swifter,
their barking ancient, despicable.

As he fell, his chest turned to breastplate,
his one powerful arm covered with pagan signs.

Nearly stupid in my waiting for what would happen next,
each breath propelling me and him toward dust,
I woke, the sheets soaked, heart fluttering—:

When death comes into the sleeping room as through a tiny hole,
like a rent in the Covenant, it hurts."
613,The Waking,Theodore Roethke,"I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.   
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.   
I learn by going where I have to go.

We think by feeling. What is there to know?   
I hear my being dance from ear to ear.   
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.

Of those so close beside me, which are you?   
God bless the Ground!   I shall walk softly there,   
And learn by going where I have to go.

Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?   
The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;   
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.

Great Nature has another thing to do   
To you and me; so take the lively air,   
And, lovely, learn by going where to go.

This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.   
What falls away is always. And is near.   
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.   
I learn by going where I have to go."
614,The Waking,Arthur Sze,"Blue plums in the pewter bowl—
may they wake wet in the earth the wren singing
and cull the sweetest violet.
But the children sleep secure in blankets.

I climbed by spinning arms and legs against walls,
awakened waist-deep in the water-well;
wrestled the black bull before an audience,
beat the wind without wings,
paced the steeds along pampas grass . . .

In the morning chill
I breathe moths in my cupped hands."
615,Walking,Thomas Traherne,"To walk abroad is, not with eyes,
But thoughts, the fields to see and prize;
      Else may the silent feet,
           Like logs of wood,
Move up and down, and see no good
      Nor joy nor glory meet.

Ev’n carts and wheels their place do change,
But cannot see, though very strange
      The glory that is by;
           Dead puppets may
Move in the bright and glorious day,
      Yet not behold the sky.

And are not men than they more blind,
Who having eyes yet never find
      The bliss in which they move;
           Like statues dead
They up and down are carried
      Yet never see nor love.

To walk is by a thought to go;
To move in spirit to and fro;
      To mind the good we see;
           To taste the sweet;
Observing all the things we meet
      How choice and rich they be.

To note the beauty of the day,
And golden fields of corn survey;
      Admire each pretty flow’r
           With its sweet smell;
To praise their Maker, and to tell
      The marks of his great pow’r.

To fly abroad like active bees,
Among the hedges and the trees,
      To cull the dew that lies
           On ev’ry blade,
From ev’ry blossom; till we lade
      Our minds, as they their thighs.

Observe those rich and glorious things,
The rivers, meadows, woods, and springs,
      The fructifying sun;
           To note from far
The rising of each twinkling star
      For us his race to run.

A little child these well perceives,
Who, tumbling in green grass and leaves,
      May rich as kings be thought,
           But there’s a sight
Which perfect manhood may delight,
      To which we shall be brought.

While in those pleasant paths we talk,
’Tis that tow’rds which at last we walk;
      For we may by degrees
           Wisely proceed
Pleasures of love and praise to heed,
      From viewing herbs and trees."

and their two-legged tubercular
masters fertilize
the corners and side-walks
ever want to know what would happen
if your life could be fertilized
by a love thought   
from a loved one
who loves you

ever look south
on a clear day and not see
time’s squares but see
tall Birch trees with sycamores   
touching hands
and see gazelles running playfully   
after the lions
ever hear the antelope bark
from the third floor apartment

ever, did you ever, sit down
and wonder about what freedom’s freedom
would bring
it’s so easy to be free
you start by loving yourself   
then those who look like you   
all else will come
naturally

ever wonder why
so much asphalt was laid
in so little space
probably so we would forget   
the Iroquois, Algonquin
and Mohicans who could caress   
the earth

ever think what Harlem would be
like if our herbs and roots and elephant ears   
grew sending
a cacophony of sound to us
the parrot parroting black is beautiful black is beautiful   
owls sending out whooooo’s making love ...   
and me and you just sitting in the sun trying
to find a way to get a banana tree from one of the monkeys   
koala bears in the trees laughing at our listlessness

ever think its possible
for us to be
happy"
617,Walking the Dunes,Brenda Hillman,"In movies when the hero is about to die,
He scatters a few phrases in a place like this,
Hoping the words will come up again
Immortal, or the grasses will reach out for him
As now they do for us.

Someone has planted a row of little trees
To stop the wind. Instead they’ve learned
To bend like the elect
In one direction only; they know
The sea will shatter them.

Isn’t it always like this?
Something uncontrollable becomes the hero,
Taking off its dress, the ice plants
Sunburn from the center out
So we can see that their deaths

Of splendid rust and yellow are not ours,
We are allowed again the glare
Of the sand, the druid hills,
The grasses brushing the legs, though
Just to have felt it once would have been enough."
618,Walsinghame,Sir Walter Raleigh,"As you came from the holy land
   of Walsinghame
Met you not with my true love
   By the way as you came?

How shall I know your true love
   That have met many one
As I went to the holy land
   That have come, that have gone?

She is neither white nor brown
   But as the heavens fair
There is none hath a form so divine
   In the earth or the air.

Such an one did I meet, good Sir,
   Such an Angelic face,
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear
   By her gait, by her grace.

She hath left me here all alone,
   All alone as unknown,
Who sometimes did me lead with her self,
   And me loved as her own.

What’s the cause that she leaves you alone
   And a new way doth take;
Who loved you once as her own
   And her joy did you make?

I have loved her all my youth,
   But now old, as you see,
Love likes not the falling fruit
   From the withered tree.

Know that love is a careless child
   And forgets promise past,
He is blind, he is deaf when he list
   And in faith never fast.

His desire is a dureless content
   And a trustless joy
He is won with a world of despair
   And is lost with a toy.

Of womenkind such indeed is the love
   Or the word Love abused
Under which many childish desires
   And conceits are excused.

But true Love is a durable fire
   In the mind ever burning;
Never sick, never old, never dead,
   From itself never turning."
619,"Walt, the Wounded",W. S. Di Piero,"The whole world was there, plucking their linen,   
half-bald, mumbling, sucking on their moustache tips.   
Broadway was still in business and they asked no favors.

All the cracked ribs of Fredericksburg,
the boys who held their tongues at Chancellorsville   
as the bandages, mule shit, skin and shot

overran the Rappahannock’s banks   
and poured it in our mouths   
that summer.

He sat up half the night reading to the Army of the Potomac   
poems about trooping goats and crazy fathers   
chewing grass in the wilderness.

         It’s me that saved his life, dear mother,

         he had dysentery, bronchitis, and something else   
         the doctors couldn’t properly diagnose.   
         He’s no different than the others.

         I bring them letter-paper,   
         envelopes, oranges, tobacco, jellies,   
         arrowroot, gingersnaps, and shinplasters.

         Last night I was lucky enough   
         to have ice cream for them all
         and they love me each and every one.

The early teachers stretched on canvas cots
with their bad grammar, backs smeared by caissons,   
a heap of arms and legs junked beneath a tree

 about a load for a one-horse cart. At night,   
campfires peaked by shebangs in the bush.   
He’d find the stagedrivers laid up there—

Broadway Joe, George Storms, Pop Rice, Handly Fish,
Old Elephant and his brother Young Elephant (who came later),   
Yellow Joe, Julep Tarn, Tick Finn, and Patsy Dee—

the pinched khaki drifting down the gangways,   
homecomers looking for those not waiting there,   
bamboo lays and punji sticks alive in their dreams.

A small fire still burns in the nursery.   
Rice and molasses simmer on the stove.   
Children will have to learn to ask for less,

less from the elephant dawn that chilled   
across the heights where Lee held his ground.   
The sky curled its wrath about the land

and they brought America’s fire home.
Fire on our hands, ashes at Bull Run, buckets from Pleiku   
while he stood watching on the shore, pulling his beard.

         America seems to me now, though only   
         in her youth, but brought already here,   
         feeble, bandaged, and bloody in hospital.

Our roughed-up beauties dead or dying,
he sang them goodnight with his hands in his pockets
who would have kissed them and warmed their flesh forever.

When Oscar F. Wilbur asked if he enjoyed religion:   
 Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean,   
and yet may-be it is the same thing.

To worship the fire in the nursery, fire in the hills   
and in the mouths of those I love. I do know why   
our wounded died.        I do know.       I know."
620,Wanted,Frank Stanford,"Luis Buñuel

A white bull, a cassock, an antique mirror
The famous ones have passed hours in front of,
A midnight blue tuxedo, a fainting couch, a key
To a box of lewd photographs, a swastika,
Twelve bales of hay, three grave plots, a statue
Of Christ holding a heart pierced by a dagger,
A black patch, all kinds of utensils for the sick—
Including thirty-nine feet of catheter tubing,
A houseboat, a dog, a baby grand, an oar
Said to have been carved from a lovely river
And a woman’s hat by Alfred Jarry, a mattress,
A shotgun, a diving helmet, an essay on The Art
Of Taxidermy and a clitoris mounted on a ring
Like quartz, a crescent wrench, a bulldozer."
621,War Ballad,Stanley Moss,"(after the Russian)

The piano has crawled into the quarry. Hauled   
In last night for firewood, sprawled
With frozen barrels, crates and sticks,
The piano is waiting for the axe.

Legless, a black box, still polished;   
It lies on its belly like a lizard,   
Droning, heaving, hardly fashioned   
For the quarry’s primordial art.

Blood red: his frozen fingers cleft,
Two on the right hand, five on the left,
He goes down on his knees to reach the keyboard,   
To strike the lizard’s chord.

Seven fingers pick out rhymes and rhythm,   
The frozen skin, steaming, peels off them,   
As from a boiled potato. Their schemes,
Their beauty, ivory and anthracite,
Flicker and flash like the great Northern Lights.

Everything played before is a great lie.   
The reflections of flaming chandeliers—
Deceit, the white columns, the grand tiers   
In warm concert halls—wild lies.

But the steel of the piano howls in me,   
I lie in the quarry and I am deft
As the lizard. I accept the gift.
I’ll be a song for Russia, I’ll be
an étude, warmth and bread for everybody."
622,The War in the Air,Howard Nemerov,"For a saving grace, we didn't see our dead,
Who rarely bothered coming home to die
But simply stayed away out there
In the clean war, the war in the air.

Seldom the ghosts come back bearing their tales
Of hitting the earth, the incompressible sea,
But stayed up there in the relative wind,
Shades fading in the mind,

Who had no graves but only epitaphs
Where never so many spoke for never so few:
Per ardua, said the partisans of Mars,
Per aspera, to the stars.

That was the good war, the war we won
As if there was no death, for goodness's sake.
With the help of the losers we left out there
In the air, in the empty air."
623,The Warning,Robert Creeley,"For love—I would
split open your head and put   
a candle in
behind the eyes.

Love is dead in us
if we forget
the virtues of an amulet   
and quick surprise."
624,A Wasp Woman Visits a Black Junkie in Prison,Etheridge Knight,"After explanations and regulations, he
Walked warily in.
Black hair covered his chin, subscribing to
Villainous ideal.
“This can not be real,” he thought, “this is a
Classical mistake;
This is a cake baked with embarrassing icing;
Somebody’s got
Likely as not, a big fat tongue in cheek!
What have I to do
With a prim and proper-blooded lady?”
Christ in deed has risen
When a Junkie in prison visits with a Wasp woman.

“Hold your stupid face, man,
Learn a little grace, man; drop a notch the sacred shield.
She might have good reason,
Like: ‘I was in prison and ye visited me not,’ or—some such.
So sweep clear
Anachronistic fear, fight the fog,
And use no hot words.”

After the seating
And the greeting, they fished for a denominator,
Common or uncommon;
And could only summon up the fact that both were human.
“Be at ease, man!
Try to please, man!—the lady is as lost as you:
‘You got children, Ma’am?’” he said aloud.

The thrust broke the dam, and their lines wiggled in the water.
She offered no pills
To cure his many ills, no compact sermons, but small
And funny talk:
“My baby began to walk... simply cannot keep his room clean...”
Her chatter sparked no resurrection and truly
No shackles were shaken
But after she had taken her leave, he walked softly,
And for hours used no hot words."
625,The Waste Carpet,William Matthews,"No day is right for the apocalypse,
if you ask a housewife in Talking
Rock, Georgia, or maybe Hop River,
Connecticut. She is opening a plastic bag.
A grotesque parody of the primeval muck
starts oozing out. And behold,
the plastic bag is magic;
there is no closing it. Soap
in unsoftened water, sewage, asbestos
coiled like vermicelli, Masonite shavings,
a liquefied lifetime subscription
to The New York Times delivered all at once.
Empty body stockings, limp, forlorn,
like collapsed lungs. A blithering slur
of face creams, an army of photocopies
travelling on its stomach of acronyms,
tooth paste tubes wrung rigid and dry.
Also, two hundred and one tons
of crumpled bumpers wrapped in insurance
claims, slag, coal dust, plastic trimmings,
industrial excrementa. Lake Erie is returning
our gifts.

       At first she thought she had won
something. Now it slithers through the house,
out windows, down the street, spreading
everywhere but heading, mostly, west.
Maybe heading is the wrong word,
implying shape and choice. It took
the shape of the landscape
it rippled across like the last blanket.
And it went west because the way lay open
once again: not the same fecund rug
the earth grew when white people scraped
their first paths to the Pacific
across the waves of the inland grasses.

Outside Ravenswood, West Virginia,
abandoned cars shine in the sun
like beetlebacks. The ore it took
to make the iron it took to make the steel
it took to make the cars, that ore
would remember the glaciers if it could.
Now comes another grinding, but not—
thanks to our new techniques—so slow.
The amiable cars wait stilly in their pasture.
Three Edsels forage in the southeast corner
like bishops of a ruined church.
There are Fords and Dodges, a Mercury
on blocks, four Darts and a Pierce Arrow,
a choir of silenced Chevrolets.
And, showing their lapsed trademarks
and proud grilles to a new westward
expansion, two Hudsons, a LaSalle
and a DeSoto.

       I was hoping to describe
the colors of this industrial autumn—
rust, a faded purple like the dusty
skin of a Concord grape, flaking moss-
green paint with primer peeking
blandly through, the garish macho reds
insurance companies punish, the greys
(opaque) and silvers (bright), the snob colors
(e.g. British Racing Green), the two-tone
combinations time will spurn like roadkill
(1957: pink and grey), cornflower
blue, naval blue, royal blue, stark blue, true
blue, the blacker blue the diver sees
beneath him when he plumbs thirty feet—
but now they are all covered,
rolling and churning in the last
accident, like bubbles in lava.

And now my Cincinnati—the hills
above the river, the lawn that drained
toward Ricwood Ave. like a small valley of uncles,
the sultry river musk that slid
like a compromising note through my bedroom window—
and indeed all Cincinnati seethes. The vats
at Proctor & Gamble cease their slick
congealing, and my beloved birthplace
is but another whorl of dirt.

Up north near Lebanon and Troy and Rosewood,
the corn I skulked in as a boy
lays back its ears like a shamed dog.
Hair along the sow’s spine rises.
The Holstein pivots his massive head
toward where the barn stood; the spreading stain
he sees is his new owner.

What we imagined was the fire-storm,
or, failing that, the glacier.
Or we hoped we’d get off easy,
losing only California.
With the seismologists and mystics
we say the last California ridge
crumble into the ocean.

And we were read with elegies:

O California, sportswear
and defense contracts, gasses that induce
deference, high school girls
with their own cars, we wanted
to love you without pain.

O California, when you were moored to us
like a vast splinter of melon,
like a huge and garish gondola,
then we were happier, although
we showed it by easy contempt.
But now you are lost at sea,
your cargo of mudslides and Chardonnays
lost, the prints of the old movies
lost, the thick unlighted candles of the redwoods
snuffed in advance. On the ocean floor
they lie like hands of a broken clock.

O California, here we come,
quoting Ecclesiastes,
ruinous with self-knowledge.

Meanwhile, because the muck won’t stop
for lamentation, Kansas succumbs.
Drawn down by anklets of DDT,
the jayhawk circles lower and lower
while the sludge moils and crests.

Now we are about to lose our voices
we remember that tomorrow is our echo.
O the old songs, the good days:
bad faith and civil disobedience,
sloppy scholarship and tooth decay.
Now the age of footnotes is ours.
Ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid.

While the rivers thickened and fish
rose like vomit, the students of water
stamped each fish with its death date.
Don’t let a chance like this go by,
they thought, though it went by
as everything went by—towers
of water flecked by a confetti
of topsoil, clucked tongues, smug
prayers. What we paid too much for
and too little attention to,
our very lives, all jumbled
now and far too big in aggregate
to understand or mourn, goes by,
and all our eloquence places its
weight on the spare word goodbye."
626,Watch Repair,Charles Simic,"A small wheel
Incandescent,
Shivering like
A pinned butterfly.

Hands thrown up
In all directions:
The crossroads
One arrives at
In a nightmare.

Higher than that
Number 12 presides
Like a beekeeper
Over the swarming honeycomb
Of the open watch.

Other wheels
That could fit
Inside a raindrop.

Tools
That must be splinters
Of arctic starlight.

Tiny golden mills
Grinding invisible
Coffee beans.

When the coffee’s boiling
Cautiously,
So it doesn’t burn us,
We raise it
To the lips
Of the nearest
Ear."
627,Watching the Complex Train-Track Changes,Bernadette Mayer,"To Men

You put on an ornate ballgown
You say “someone has to do it”
You take me to where you work,
The inside of a pyramid with chasms,
Watching the complex train-track changes
Products and objects make love to my father
Two babies are born—Bruno and Daisy
You take your shirt off looking boylike & lovely
You get on the plane, both clown & wizard
And then get off in a comedy of manners
Our dates become a comedy of dinners
Your name rhymes with clothes
Your plane folds & flies away
Without us, I’ll make the next one
We are enclosed in spaceless epics by breathless bricks
& still we’ll meet like runes or the leashes for hawks
Let’s go! Can we stay? Go to sleep.
A tree wouldn’t talk or weep if I-forget-what
And you in the train’s opulent rooms
Switch your cock to a baby and then say
“Must there (not) be a law against this?”
You add, “I have been thinking of you in my head”
You wear green glitter on your shirt instead of
A tie, that’s how I recognize you as you
You are the prep cook the sous-chef you make
Duplicating potato salad like the loaves & fishes
You create gorgeous paper-like sculptures of foods
We go down in the car through threatening snows
To arrive in a second to eat in a renovated place
You and I tell “what” we are at the end of a movie
Our podium of soft loud feet flies by accident
I take the train to your house to hear Shakespeare & Verdi
Everyone applauds when you walk in. The director
Holds up each actor & describes his physical being
I talk to your father but only by telephone
You have the royal blue 8 � x 11 notebook with the lock on it
I want one but you say you cant get them anymore
I walk twice through that city I’ve been in before
All through its rooms, its streets and its Commons"
628,The Water Diviner,Dannie Abse,"Late, I have come to a parched land
doubting my gift, if gift I have,
the inspiration of water
spilt, swallowed in the sand.

To hear once more water trickle,
to stand in a stretch of silence
the divining pen twisting in the hand:
sign of depths alluvial.

Water owns no permanent shape,
sags, is most itself descending;
now, under the shadow of the idol,
dry mouth and dry landscape.

No rain falls with a refreshing sound
to settle tubular in a well,
elliptical in a bowl. No grape
lusciously moulds it round.

Clouds have no constant resemblance
to anything, blown by a hot wind,
flying mirages; the blue background,
light constructions of chance.

To hold back chaos I transformed
amorphous mass—and fire and cloud—
so that the agèd gods might dance
and golden structures form.

I should have built, plain brick on brick,
a water tower. The sun flies on
arid wastes, barren hells too warm
and me with a hazel stick!

Rivulets vanished in the dust
long ago, great compositions
vaporized, salt on the tongue so thick
that drinking, still I thirst.

Repeated desert, recurring drought,
sometimes hearing water trickle,
sometimes not, I, by doubting first,
believe; believing, doubt."
629,The Water-fall,Henry Vaughan,"With what deep murmurs through time’s silent stealth
Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat’ry wealth
Here flowing fall,
And chide, and call,
As if his liquid, loose retinue stay’d
Ling’ring, and were of this steep place afraid;
The common pass
Where, clear as glass,
All must descend
Not to an end,
But quicken’d by this deep and rocky grave,
Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.

Dear stream! dear bank, where often I
Have sate and pleas’d my pensive eye,
Why, since each drop of thy quick store
Runs thither whence it flow’d before,
Should poor souls fear a shade or night,
Who came, sure, from a sea of light?
Or since those drops are all sent back
So sure to thee, that none doth lack,
Why should frail flesh doubt any more
That what God takes, he’ll not restore?

O useful element and clear!
My sacred wash and cleanser here,
My first consigner unto those
Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!
What sublime truths and wholesome themes
Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!
Such as dull man can never find
Unless that Spirit lead his mind
Which first upon thy face did move,
And hatch’d all with his quick’ning love.
As this loud brook’s incessant fall
In streaming rings restagnates all,
Which reach by course the bank, and then
Are no more seen, just so pass men.
O my invisible estate,
My glorious liberty, still late!
Thou art the channel my soul seeks,
Not this with cataracts and creeks."
