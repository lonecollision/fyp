0,Rain on a Barn South of Tawas,William Jolliff,"It may be as close as an old man in Michigan
comes to the sound of the sea. Call it thunder
if you want, but it’s not thunder, not at all.
It’s more like the rush of semis on a freeway

somewhere between Bay City and Flint,
the road a son will take when he learns,
sometime around the last taste of a strap,
that the life he was born to is nothing

at all like a life he’d ever bother to live.
There’s an anger in it, a tin-edged constancy
that has no rhythm, quite, something more
like white noise that still won’t let you sleep.

Think of some man, needing to get a crop in,
but the fields are sop, so he’s trying to find
something to fix, something to keep his hands
working, something to weld, something to pound,

something to wrap his calloused palms around
that might do less damage than a lead-rope
knotted and tossed over the limb of a tree.
If you ever decide to lose your years

by working this land, you might think again,
about the barn you build, or roofing it with tin."
1,Raising the Titanic,Robert Hedin,"I spent the winter my father died down in the basement,
under the calm surface of the floorboards, hundreds

of little plastic parts spread out like debris
on the table. And for months while the snow fell

and my father sat in the big chair by the Philco, dying,
I worked my way up deck by deck, story by story,

from steerage to first class, until at last it was done,
stacks, deck chairs, all the delicate rigging.

And there it loomed, a blazing city of the dead.
Then painted the gaping hole at the waterline

and placed my father at the railings, my mother
in a lifeboat pulling away from the wreckage."
2,Releasing a Tree,Thomas Reiter,"Softly pummeled overnight, the lower
limbs of our Norway spruce
flexed and the deepening snow held them.
Windless sunlight now, so I go out
wearing hip waders and carrying
not a fly rod but a garden hoe. I begin
worrying the snow for the holdfast
of a branch that’s so far down
a wren’s nest floats above it like a buoy.
I work the hoe, not chopping but cradling,
then pull straight up. A current of air
as the needles loft their burden
over my head. Those grace notes
of the snowfall, crystals giving off
copper, green, rose—watching them
I stumble over a branch, go down
and my gloves fill with snow. Ah, I find
my father here: I remember as a child
how flames touched my hand the time
I added wood to the stove in our ice-fishing
shanty, how he plunged that hand
through the hole into the river, teaching me
one kind of burning can ease another.
The branch bobs then tapers into place
and composes itself, looking
unchanged though all summer
it will bring up this day from underfoot."
3,Relic,Rachel Richardson,"The first time I touched it,
cloth fell under my fingers,
the frail white folds
softened, demure. No burn,

no combustion at the touch of skin.
It sat, silent, like any other contents
of any other box: photographs
of the dead, heirloom jewels.

Exposed to thin windowlight it is
exactly as in movies:
a long gown, and where a chest
must have breathed, a red cross

crossed over. The crown, I know,
waits underneath, the hood with eyes
carefully stitched open, arch cap
like a bishop’s, surging to its point."
4,Removing the Dross,Thomas R. Moore,"After snowstorms my father
shoveled the driveway where it lay
open to a sweep of wind across

a neighbor’s field, where the snow
drifted half way down to the paved
road, before snow-blowers, before

pick-ups cruised the streets with
THE BOSS lettered on red plows.
He heated the flat shovel

in the woodstove till the blade
steamed, like Vulcan at his furnace
removing the dross, then rubbed

a hissing candle on the steel
so the snow would slide unchecked
as he made each toss. He marked

blocks with the waxed blade, lifted
and tossed, lifted and tossed again,
squaring off against the snow."
5,The Ring Toss Lady Breaks a Five,Mark Kraushaar,"It’s all of it rigged, she says,
Bust-one-wins, Hi-striker, even the Dozer.
It’s like you think you’ll score that giant panda
for the wife except you can’t, or not
without you drop another twenty
and then—what?—then you win
a thumb-sized monkey or a little comb.
She hands me five ones and then stands.
She’s worked the whole of the midway,
she says, funnel cake to corn-dogs.
She’s worked every game
plus half the rides, Krazy Koaster,
Avalanche, Wing-Ding, Tilt-a-Whirl
and if there’s somebody sick she’ll do
a kiddy ride too, Li’l Choo-choo, maybe
the Tea Cup.
There’s a collapsing soft sigh
and she sits, opens the paper, turns a page
and as if she were the one assigned to face forwards,
as if it were her job to intuit the world
and interpret the news,
Anymore, she says, it’s out of our hands,
it’s all we can do—it’s not up to you.
You see that bald bronco tearing
tickets at the carousel?
We worked the Bottle-drop
and now he’s mine: he’s no genius
but he loves me and he’s mine.
Things happen, she says, you
can’t take them back."
6,Seed,Kathleen Driskell,"In first grade, you met Squanto,
nearly naked and
on his haunches, showing
those thick-headed pilgrims
how one must plant fish
to grow maize. And in autumn
you dove into the lobotomized
pumpkin, into the gooey pulp
and seeds, raising a clump
like a slimy chandelier
from the Titanic. And now
in late summer, daughter,
you smile, holding a ripe watermelon,
cut in half, exposing the black
seed within its bright red heart.
Your melon. How proud you are
to think you grew this delicious
thing all on your own."
7,Sixth Grade,Jeanie Greensfelder,"We didn’t like each other,
but Lynn’s mother had died,
and my father had died.

Lynn’s father didn’t know how to talk to her,
my mother didn’t know how to talk to me,
and Lynn and I didn’t know how to talk either.

A secret game drew us close:
we took turns being the prisoner,
who stood, hands held behind her back,

while the captor, using an imaginary bow,
shot arrow after arrow after arrow
into the prisoner’s heart."
8,"Sixty Years Later I Notice, Inside A Flock Of Blackbirds,",David Allan Evans,"the Venetian blinds
I dusted off

for my mother on
Saturday mornings,

closing, opening them
with the pull cord a few

times just to watch the outside
universe keep blinking,

as the flock suddenly
rises from November stubble,

hovers a few seconds,
closing, opening,

blinking, before it tilts,
then vanishes over a hill."
9,Spirit of the Bat,Peggy Shumaker,"Hair rush, low swoop—
so those of us

stuck here on earth
know—you must be gods.

Or friends of gods,
granted chances

to push off into sky,
granted chances

to hear so well
your own voice bounced

back to you
maps the night.

Each hinge
in your wing’s

an act of creation.
Each insect

you snick out of air
a witness.

You transform
obstacles

into sounds,
then dodge them."
10,A Story Can Change Your Life,Peter Everwine,"On the morning she became a young widow,
my grandmother, startled by a sudden shadow,
looked up from her work to see a hawk turn
her prized rooster into a cloud of feathers.
That same moment, halfway around the world
in a Minnesota mine, her husband died,
buried under a ton of rockfall.
She told me this story sixty years ago.
I don’t know if it’s true but it ought to be.
She was a hard old woman, and though she knelt
on Sundays when the acolyte’s silver bell
announced the moment of Christ’s miracle,
it was the darker mysteries she lived by:
shiver-cry of an owl, black dog by the roadside,
a tapping at the door and nobody there.
The moral of the story was plain enough:
miracles become a burden and require a priest
to explain them. With signs, you only need
to keep your wits about you and place your trust
in a shadow world that lets you know hard luck
and grief are coming your way. And for that
—so the story goes—any day will do."
11,Sway,Karla Huston,"The cruelest thing I did to my dog
wasn’t to ignore his barking for water
when his tongue hung like a deflated balloon

or to disregard his chronic need for a belly rub
but to teach him to shake hands,
a trick that took weeks of treats, his dark eyes

like Greek olives, moist with desire.
I made him sit, another injustice,
and allowed him to want the nuggets enough

to please me. Shake, I said. Shake?
touching the back of his right leg
until he lifted it, his saliva trickling

from soft jowls, my hand wet with his hunger.
Mistress of the biscuit, I ruffled his ears
and said good dog until he got it. Before long,

he raised his paw, shook me until he got
the treat, the rub, the water in a chilled silver bowl,
the wilderness in him gone, his eyes still lit with longing."
13,The Vanity of the Dragonfly,Nancy Willard,"The dragonfly at rest on the doorbell—
too weak to ring and glad of it,
but well mannered and cautious,
thinking it best to observe us quietly
before flying in, and who knows if he will find
the way out? Cautious of traps, this one.
A winged cross, plain, the body straight
as a thermometer, the old glass kind
that could kill us with mercury if our teeth
did not respect its brittle body. Slim as an eel
but a solitary glider, a pilot without bombs
or weapons, and wings clear and small as a wish
to see over our heads, to see the whole picture.
And when our gaze grazes over it and moves on,
the dragonfly changes its clothes,
sheds its old skin, shriveled like laundry,
and steps forth, polished black, with two
circles buttoned like epaulettes taking the last space
at the edge of its eyes."
14,Violet's Wash,Diane Gilliam Fisher,"You can’t have nothing clean.
I scrubbed like a crazy woman
at Isom’s clothes that first week
and here they come off the line, little black
stripes wherever I’d pinned them up
or hung them over—coal dust settles
on the clothesline, piles up
like a line of snow on a tree branch.
After that, I wiped down the clothesline
every time, but no matter, you can’t
get it all off. His coveralls is stripy
with black and gray lines,
ankles of his pants is ringed around,
like marks left by shackles.
I thought I’d die that first week
when I seen him walk off to the mine,
black, burnt-looking marks
on his shirt over his shoulders, right
where wings would of folded."
15,[We wonder at our shifting capacities . . .],Anna Moschovakis,"We wonder at our shifting capacities, keep
adding and striking skills
from the bottoms of our résumés
under constant revision
like the inscriptions on tombs
shared for generations
unnervingly up
to date

Made nervous by our shift in capabilities, we write:

                                            I visited a country where kittens lay  dying
                                            under every bench, in every gutter, next to
                                            every  cigarette butt. One  made  me  weep.
                                            Two   made   me  worry.  Three   made   me
                                            look  away.  I  visited  a  city  with  very  few
                                            strays.  The   first   one   I   saw   I   adopted.
                                            What  could  it  mean?
                                                                          —posted by Sarah. 6.18.06

everything looked like home"
16,"Archaeopteryx, an Elegy",Gina Franco,"As soon as possible, I will confront the wren’s
              doings, rinse the white streaks from the porch bricks
drawing lizards from their shade, the immediate
              smell of water too much for all of us.
But first is lunch. The remains we’ll scatter over
              the driveway away from the bricks. Wrens come,
crusts from our dishes make drama. Then history.

What is possible in memory is disingenuous.
              Limestone, impressed with the archaic smile
of bone and reptilian wrists, wishbones and feathers,
              describes. It cups the transitional form,
naturally selecting one’s best side. There was
              the time you forgot your legs no longer
could recall how to stand—then rose up straight and sang

               You’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me

Probably I’ve been thinking of that since August.
              The indelible wrens grate like shovels
outside—exhumed, one voice rises from wilderness,
              echoes,
                            settles, rests
                                          —then another, and,
between them, the keep of an unerring quiet."
17,Classic Toy,Mary M. Brown,"The plastic army men are always green.

 They’re caught in awkward poses,
 one arm outstretched as if to fire,
 legs parted and forever stuck on a swiggle
 of support, as rigid and green as the boots.

 This one has impressions of pockets,
 a belt, a collar, a grip on tiny binoculars
 intended to enlarge, no doubt, some
 tiny enemy.

 In back, attached to the belt is a canteen
 or a grenade (it’s hard to tell). The helmet
 is pulled down low, so as to hide the eyes.

 If I point the arm, the gun, toward me,
 I see that this soldier is very thin.

 It’s almost unreal, how thin he is."

19,Descant,Tyrone Williams,"I left my heart in the teeth of jumper-cables—
black tongue, superfluous nipples . . .

 By The Time I hit the yellow tape—
it was already turning red . . .

Of my fair and alabaster love?
My redundant chains drawn in chalk?

 Halfway to the stars I stopped—

20,Earth Light: I,Lynn Xu,Doors open and shut. We’ve come to the place where nothing shines. I hear eternity Is self-forgetting.  Interiors warm with the nightmare of guests and poetry And you.  Everything darkly Reverent years of reading about death eluded. Bled Back from the ear sidestepping your bullets bloom in on ye lay Rock.  Rud.  Spread So swiftly tastes like mud.  Dredged mud off The corpse sled hushed down woodsmoke. Said the stars thrum on Marie Marie.  Hold on tight. In the depths of outer space Is man.
21,Lullaby [For Charles Baudelaire],Lynn Xu,"Lie me down to heal in sleep, do not let me wake
In sin, the tongue
Cancels another year, another painted storm
In the coral caves, some pious poet
Drunk on vapors
Swatting tomb-bats in the nightwood, would that
Wayward bark sunned white
Be also thunder, a hill of bones drumming—thud
Thud, a wake
Of buzzards braiding into the loosening skull—the redoubled fists
Of students like an island in the bramble chained—I have been told
To reason, lawless, empty, without rights—
But I am old
Not age, I have been told
To match its columns by our footfall, prophet—I am not
The straw or garland of our Sirens, not the brow
Of holly, nor the warble
Of any lark"
22,Glass was the Street - in Tinsel Peril (1518),Emily Dickinson,"Glass was the Street - in Tinsel Peril
Tree and Traveller stood.
Filled was the Air with merry venture
Hearty with Boys the Road.

Shot the lithe Sleds like Shod vibrations
Emphacized and gone
It is the Past’s supreme italic
Makes the Present mean -"
23,I never hear that one is dead (1325),Emily Dickinson,"I never hear that one is dead
Without the chance of Life
Afresh annihilating me
That mightiest Belief,

Too mighty for the Daily mind
That tilling it’s abyss,
Had Madness, had it once or, Twice
The yawning Consciousness,

Beliefs are Bandaged, like the Tongue
When Terror were it told
In any Tone commensurate
Would strike us instant Dead -

He dare in lonely Place
That awful stranger - Consciousness
Deliberately face -"
25,The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants - (1350),Emily Dickinson,"The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants -
At Evening, it is not
At Morning, in a Truffled Hut
It stop opon a Spot

As if it tarried always
And yet it’s whole Career
Is shorter than a Snake’s Delay -
And fleeter than a Tare -

’Tis Vegetation’s Juggler -
The Germ of Alibi -
Doth like a Bubble antedate
And like a Bubble, hie -

I feel as if the Grass was pleased
To have it intermit -
This surreptitious Scion
Of Summer’s circumspect.

Had Nature an Apostate -

26,A not admitting of the wound (1188),Emily Dickinson,"A not admitting of the wound
Until it grew so wide
That all my Life had entered it
And there were troughs beside -

A closing of the simple lid that opened to the sun
Until the tender Carpenter
Perpetual nail it down -"
27,Broken Sonnet,John Yau,"The world weeps. There are no tears
To be found. It is deemed a miracle.
The president appears on screens
In villages and towns, in cities in jungles
And jungles still affectionately called cities.
He appears on screens and reads a story.
Whose story is he reading and why?
What lessons are to be learned from this story
About a time that has not arrived, will not arrive, is here?
Time of fire and images of fire climbing toward the sun
Time of precious and semi-precious liquids
Time of a man and a woman doused in ink
Rolling across streams and down valleys
Trying to leave some string of words behind."
28,Half Omen Half Hope,Joanna Klink,"When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked,
When their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable,
They will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers
Against hills in the cooler hours before dark, and the moss at the foot of the forest
When green starts to leave it. What they take into their privacy (half of his embrace,
Her violence at play) are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them.
Moons unearth them. And when, in their separate dwellings, their bodies
Feel the next season come, they no longer have anyone to whom
To tell it. Clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness
Peers back in. If they love, it is solely to be adored, it is to scatter and gather
Themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set.
In the quiet woods, from the highest trees, there is always something
Weightless falling; and he, who must realize that certain losses are irreparable,
Tells himself at night, before the darkest mirror, that vision keeps him whole.

On the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves
Are like sheets of dark water, or ice forests, or husks of ships. To stop a thing
Such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person’s
Thoughts. The imprint they make on each other’s bodies is worth any pain
They may have caused. Quiet falls around them. And when she reaches
For him the air greens like underwater light and the well-waters drop.
They will see again the shadows of insects.
They will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed
Into them. If what is no longer present in them cannot be restored,
It can at least be offered. Through long bewildered dusks, stalks grow;
Rains fill and pass out of clouds; animals hover at the edges of fields
With eyes like black pools. For nothing cannot be transformed;
Pleasure and failure feed each other daily. Do not think any breeze,
Any grain of light, shall be withheld. All the stars will sail out for them."
29,Introduction,John Yau,"It had to be from someone whose grandparents were born in Shanghai
not the city’s greatest citizens, but certainly among the sober ones
to make their small now eroded mark
It had to be from a distant or dissolute descendant (yes, moi)
who can sing praises unworthy of even a flicker of your attention

Doesn’t this sound like it might turn into a love poem or a prayer
Well, you are wrong, because a man of the people,
which I am not nor will I ever be,
doesn’t single out one above all others
as this is a hierarchical construction
and therefore undemocratic and antihumanist

It had to be from someone whose virtues do not include stubbornness,
patience, gentleness, loyalty, or truthfulness

It had to be from someone who could take my place
after I left the room
never to return

It had to be from someone who didn’t exist
before this poem
began writing itself down"
30,A Sheaf of Pleasant Voices,John Yau,"There are rooftops
made of cloud remnants

gathered by a trader
dabbling in car parts and burlap

At night, I dive onto the breeze
fermenting above the dirt

and dream that I am a crocodile
a tin of shoe polish, an audience of two

In the morning, before the smallest yawn
becomes a noodle, I am offered

a ribbon of yellow smoke
I opt for fuzzy rocks and clawed water

and, of course, the perishable window
I am one of the last computer

chain errors to be illuminated
I tell you there are rooftops

on which the moon stops
being a cold jewel

And one by one the mountains
begin their descent from

the chambers of a lost book"
31,What Is (War),Joanna Klink,"And if all those who meet or even
hear of you become witness to what you are—

a white country of blight beneath the last snows of
spring. Could we remain quiet on earth

and bear it, the war we make inside
what is—it’s a long time to be here, to be still,

to feel the rot inside now—bone-scrap, char, sheets of stars
at the edge of a field where we are once again

taken from ourselves. Could we remain here,
witness to grief, one last bright dire call-and-reply,

each birdsong or siren extinguished where some
trueness abides, some portion we have lost our right

to claim or know. It comes into any mind that would
perceive it, leaf-rot, speech-rot, the deliberate ribcage

of the deer, these abrupt chalk cliffs over which
the confused animals fling themselves, and you,

obscure, receive no response that is not suffered
as the days grow long and distortions

come to seem the natural course of things—
what trees whose creatures stray into space—

and they find they cannot land though the eyelid
struggles open—no answer, no resolution—

a window opened to the mute green world,
weedy and driftless, a wind drilling rain, dirt,

the parameters of uncertainty, of hope,
what we might be against what we have done,

bees crawling through the lips of the one
who would say the earth turned into sour flesh—

What strange rooms, what soundless movement of sky
over desert where the flesh again is beaten

and the emptiness extends itself while some old man
looks on, a raptor in waiting, the sand-field

around them blown thinly toward sun—no longer
ourselves in the afternoons, evenings,

weak, vague, clutched at the mouth—
because we did nothing, because we lost count."
32,Apology,Joanna Klink,"Lately, too much disturbed, you stay trailing in me
and I believe you. How could I not feel
you were misspent, there by books stacked clean on glass,
or outside the snow arriving as I am still arriving.
If the explanations amount to something, I will tell you.
It is enough, you say, that surfaces grow so distant.
Maybe you darken, already too much changed,
maybe in your house you would be content where
no incident emerges, but for smoke or glass or air,
such things held simply to be voiceless.
And if you mean me, I believe you.
Or if you should darken, this inwardness would be misspent,
and flinching I might pause, and add to these meager
incidents the words. Some books
should stay formal on the shelves.
So surely I heard you, in your complication aware,
snow holding where it might weightless rest,
and should you fold into me—trackless, misspent,
too much arranged—I might believe you
but swiftly shut, lines of smoke rising through snow,
here where it seems no good word emerges.
Though it is cold, I am aware such reluctance
could lose these blinking hours to simple safety.
Here is an inwardless purpose.
In these hours when snow shuts, it may be we empty,
amounting to something. How could I not
wait for those few words, which we might enter."
33,Auroras,Joanna Klink,"It began in a foyer of evenings
The evenings left traces of glass in the trees
A book and a footpath we followed
Under throat-pipes of birds

We moved through a room of leaves
Thin streams of silver buried under our eyes
A field of white clover buried under our eyes
Or a river we stopped at to watch
The wind cross it, recross it

Room into room you paused
Where once on a stoop we leaned back
Talking late into daylight
The morning trees shook off twilight
Opening and closing our eyes auroras

Beyond groves and flora we followed a road
Dotted with polished brown bottles,
Scoured furrows, a wood emptied of trees

It was enough to hollow us out
The evenings left grasses half-wild at our feet
Branches with spaces for winds

The earth changes
The way we speak to each other has changed
As for a long while we stood in a hall full of exits
Listening for a landscape beyond us"
34,Compound Hibernation,Will Alexander,"Those who glance about me
who cease to see inside the Sun
who cease to imagine its destabilized pre-quanta
cannot know me
cannot know my ethos as pumice
as mingled apparition or flare

my perception through the prior sun that I ingest
like a blackened pre-existence
or collected hawks through assignation

the Sun
with its dualisms
with its pre-biotic photons which waver

perhaps
9 suns before the Sun existed
before the oceans seemed formed
there were molecular drafts

akashic precursors
floating proto-ammonia

I think of carbon
& wisps
& floodings

of feral combat shelter
where blank geometry accrues

before separable biology was born
before the contradictory ballast of de-existent protozoa

being scorching photon by abstentia
like a pre-atomic sigil
destabilized as blizzard

a pre-cognitive rotation
a strange galvanics of the cosmos

& because of this galvanics
one reeks of invisible tremor
walking around in league with daunting helium affliction

thus
the mirrors in my skin like haunted salamander fluid
like cells bereft with cooling centigrade rotation

therefore
I know the abyss as volatile lunar transposition
as sub-liminal mantis as climbing
as splintering

therefore I am not
an oily or blasphemous yogin
collapsing in default by sudden anger or water

yet I am compound
struggling with scattered mental a-rhythmia
with partial psychic aphasia
intensive
illusive
aloof by interior compounding"
35,Thought Experiment: Mary in the Black-and-White Room*,Anna Moschovakis,"Some things lock in competition, like an earthquake and a kiss. While a decision is waiting to be made, neither side of the argument progresses. The earthquake, though eager to prove its claim, shows valiant restraint; the kiss? It knows the power of bitten tongues.
 

Such stand-offs as these precede most gains (stance of knowing too much and fearing too late). The tongues, shaking along with the house, say nothing shattering at all.
 

With progress, not only earthquakes but kisses will be predicted. The last fine line between feeling and fact will choose a good point, and end. Flattery will continue to make us immortal in the difficult years between the first word and the lost.

36,Thought Experiment: Twin Earth and the Glass of Water*,Anna Moschovakis,"That was the day your mesmerized went awol on the shore. Each star, you said, was the same star. Beneath our sunny beach blanket an anonymous moisture spread like fur. It’s getting dark and darker.
 

Dusk is hard. Gossip travels worst when it’s low-contrast out; it stalls, and the air begins to crack. Droplets black as blood squeeze through fissures, making night.
 

What came from above—the forestscan, the cornucump, the mar—came violently on our feet. Finally, when it was time to order, you pulled yourself up from the syntax we’d shared and beckoned for me to come. It’s just like rain, I said, as if to make amends. Every arm is the same arm, you replied, and took mine.

 


* In which an unwitting traveler to a parallel universe, offered trum and toke all night, drinks himself out of his depth to drown the unknown source of his discomfort."
38,Auto-Lullaby,Franz Wright,"Think of   a sheep
knitting a sweater;
think of   your life
getting better and better.

Think of   your cat
asleep in a tree;
think of   that spot
where you once skinned your knee.

Think of   a bird
that stands in your palm.
Try to remember
the Twenty-first Psalm.

Think of   a big pink horse
galloping south;
think of   a fly, and
close your mouth.

If   you feel thirsty, then
drink from your cup.
The birds will keep singing
until they wake up."

We took him
to the carnival

     crying

Electric
green and red tears

41,Burn Lake,Carrie Fountain,"For Burn Construction Company

When you were building the i-10 bypass, 
one of   your dozers, moving earth 
at the center of a great pit, 
slipped its thick blade beneath 
the water table, slicing into the earth’s 
wet palm, and the silt moistened 
beneath the huge thing’s tires, and the crew 
was sent home for the day. 
Next morning, water filled the pit. 
Nothing anyone could do to stop it coming. 
It was a revelation: kidney-shaped, deep 
green, there between the interstate 
and the sewage treatment plant. 
When nothing else worked, you called it 
a lake and opened it to the public. 
And we were the public."
43,Doors,Carl Sandburg,"An open door says, “Come in.”
A shut door says, “Who are you?”
Shadows and ghosts go through shut doors.
If   a door is shut and you want it shut,

If   a door is open and you want it open,

A dollar says hello.

At home I try growing
a new life, one of many

46,From “Bestiary”,Sherman Alexie,"My mother sends me a black-and-white
photograph of   her and my father, circa
1968, posing with two Indian men.

“Who are those Indian guys?” I ask her
on the phone.

“I don’t know,” she says.

The next obvious question: “Then why
did you send me this photo?” But I don’t
ask it.

One of those strange Indian men is
pointing up toward the sky.

Above them, a bird shaped like a

47,From the Middle,Katharine Coles,"How much of everything is pure
Getting ready. Dressing, pushing the button
Asquint through its machined furl
Only to unbutton, the eyes-open moment

Revealed. Ask any animal: nudity isn’t
The same as nakedness. Once you’ve seen
A dangling, you can’t unsee it, and
From that anything might ensue.

There’s the rub. Taking the long view
You could say the future is romantic
I suppose. Also something you
Could never do without, though its bric-

It’s arranged. Or not. Then, a miracle?"
48,In the Low Countries,Stuart Mills,"They are building a ship

50,Lisbon,Eliza Griswold,"We meet midway to walk white cobbles 
under a fish-flesh gray sky. 
Europe is collapsing; we are collapsing

always and again no matter how hard
we love one another. I don’t understand 
our failure, where the feed loops 

back and spits us into another country, 
another junior suite reenacting this same,
same beat of   a scene that begins, rises,

never ends, always ends —
Our intentions don’t meet, 
their courses set differently 

by a force you don’t believe in,
could be as simple as life. I want 
to be the wife you don’t want. 

You won’t let go of my wrist. 
I resist, threaten, bully, acquiesce. 
We write the next act of The Alchemist

in New York, Lisbon, a beach, 
a bar, star-crossed maybe 
from different galaxies. You approach, 

I retreat. You retreat, I reproach.

51,Milton’s God,Nate Klug,"Where i-95 meets the Pike, 
a ponderous thunderhead flowered;

stewed a minute, then flipped
like a flash card, tattered
edges crinkling in, linings so dark 
with excessive bright

that, standing, waiting, at the overpass edge, 
the onlooker couldn’t decide

until the end, or even then,
what was revealed and what had been hidden."
53,Monsters,Dorothea Lasky,"This is a world where there are monsters
There are monsters everywhere, racoons and skunks
There are possums outside, there are monsters in my bed.
There is one monster. He is my little one.
I talk to my little monster.
I give my little monster some bacon but that does not satisfy him.
I tell him, ssh ssh, don’t growl little monster!
And he growls, oh boy does he growl!
And he wants something from me,
He wants my soul.
And finally giving in, I give him my gleaming soul
And as he eats my gleaming soul, I am one with him
And stare out his eyepits and I see nothing but white
And then I see nothing but fog and the white I had seen before was nothing but fog
And there is nothing but fog out the eyes of monsters."
54,“My hat”,Henry Parland,"My hat
was run over

This morning

55,Nocturne,W. S. Di Piero,"Where are you now,
my poems, 
my sleepwalkers?
No mumbles tonight?
Where are you, thirst,
fever, humming tedium?
The sodium streetlights 
burr outside my window, 
steadfast, unreachable, 
little astonishments 
lighting the way uphill.
Where are you now,
when I need you most?
             It’s late. I’m old. 
                         Come soon, you feral cats

56,Observer,Nate Klug,"Not seeing me, not even looking, 
K. on her silver cruiser charms her way

through the last long moment 
of   the changing light: 

snow boots and a Seychelles Warbler’s 
old blue tights,

a rolled-up yoga mat in her basket
wobbling like a wild tiller as she pedals. 

It feels illicit and somewhat right 
to stand across the intersection 

without shouting 
her name, or even waving.

According to the internet
tutorial, the fact that photons 

turn into tiny loyal billiard balls
as soon as we start watching suggests

no error of method 
or measurement, but rather, 

as far as anyone can tell, 
an invisibly unstable world, 

a shaking everywhere 
that seeing must pin down and fix.

So, that morning I stumbled on you
out, alone, bending through

the traffic at Orange and Edwards Streets:
a someone else then 

whom I, alone, 
can never otherwise see —

there has to be a kind of   speech
beyond naming, or even praise,

a discipline 
that locates light and lets it go."
57,The One About the Robbers,Zachary Schomburg,"You tell me a joke about two robbers who hide from the police. One robber hides as a sack of cats and the other robber hides as a sack of potatoes. That is the punch line somehow, the sack of potatoes, but all I can think about is how my dad used to throw me over his shoulder when I was very small and call me his sack of potatoes. I’ve got a sack of potatoes he would yell, spinning around in a circle, the arm not holding me reaching out for a sale. Does anyone want to buy my sack of potatoes? No one ever wanted to buy me. We were always the only two people in the room."
58,One Canoe,Maureen N. McLane,"Recalcitrant elephants

The angry young males
of murdered mothers.

Any Martian could see it
how we did it

The historian of   the future
is amazed. So much feeling

once in so many bodies. 
But maybe they were different
didn’t think or feel that much.

Apocalypse is easy
Thinking’s hard

Should we summon
a Roman Stoic to narrate?
Someone secretly thrilled
by the gore?

The clouds move through
an Adirondack sky unscored 
by satellite towers. 

People want what they want
& what they want is never one thing.

All that desire
sliming a space rock

Shivering the air 
a loon’s cry. 
There is only so much
you can care for or carry

& for this there is 
no one canoe"
59,Poem,Ron Padgett,"I’m in the house.
It’s nice out: warm
sun on cold snow.

60,Rilke Rereading Hölderlin,George Kalogeris,"Footnotes to the tower. For “He spends the summer
There, in a state of violent agitation,”
Read: “It’s there, in his agitation’s most violent
State that Hölderlin suspends the summer” —
Like a yellow pear above the untroubled water.

For the lost, disheveled decades of derangement,
Translate I was struck by Apollo as you
Must change your life. For sonnets that sing their own
Spontaneous, Orphic necessity to praise,
Think naked as a lightning rod he waited.

For necessity insert Anangke. But for
Anangke, “Lord, just one more summer, please.”
For summer, the lyre. Hölderlin in his tower.
Until autumn, when the leaves start falling. Whoever
Has nowhere to go will never get home now."
61,Sample,Eliza Griswold,"When you said no, 
             I went for your dresser, 
opened the top drawer, 
             broke the paper seals 
on the two sterile cups, 
             and wiped my dirty 
thumbs inside. 

             Because our stubborn love 
won’t die, I have to kill it, 
            will it dead. Or so 
I thought until I passed 
             a cycle on my own. 
You’ve no idea 
             what’s grown 
inside me
             since I bled."
62,Sirens,Eliza Griswold,"My transgressions pile against the garden wall
(built when Rome began to weaken, scarred 

by a cannonball.) I gossiped; I snubbed 
a dinner guest. I watch until the wall writhes 

with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows 
and the odd librarian. I’ve begun to be depleted 

by your absence; one of  love’s worst symptoms. 
For years, I’d had the sense to hold myself apart. 

I’ve been here long enough to kill 
two mint plants and a lavender, 

then resurrect their better part.
I’d like to let you die on the vine. 

Not you, the You I Dream, 
who follows through on waking. 

See how the watcher sees the storm 
but doesn’t get wet. Be that. 

Be what? 
Be wiser than the heart."
63,Some Feel Rain,Joanna Klink,"Some feel rain. Some feel the beetle startle
in its ghost-part when the bark
slips. Some feel musk. Asleep against
each other in the whiskey dark, scarcely there.
When it falls apart, some feel the moondark air
drop its motes to the patch-thick slopes of
snow. Tiny blinkings of ice from the oak,
a boot-beat that comes and goes, the line of prayer
you can follow from the dusking wind to the snowy owl
it carries. Some feel sunlight
well up in blood-vessels below the skin
and wish there had been less to lose.
Knowing how it could have been, pale maples
drowsing like a second sleep above our temperaments.
Do I imagine there is any place so safe it can’t be
snapped? Some feel the rivers shift,
blue veins through soil, as if the smokestacks were a long
dream of exhalation. The lynx lets its paws
skim the ground in snow and showers.
The wildflowers scatter in warm tints until
the second they are plucked. You can wait
to scrape the ankle-burrs, you can wait until Mercury
the early star underdraws the night and its blackest
districts. And wonder. Why others feel
through coal-thick night that deeply colored garnet
star. Why sparring and pins are all you have.
Why the earth cannot make its way towards you."
64,Squirrels,Nate Klug,"Something blurred, warmed
in the eye’s corner, like woodsmoke 
becoming tears;
but when you turned to look

the stoop was still, the pumpkin
and tacky mum pot wouldn’t talk —
just a rattle
at the gutter and a sense

of curtains, somewhere, pulled.
Five of   them later, scarfing the oak’s
black bole, 
laying a dream of snakes.

Needy and reticent
at once, these squirrels in charred November
recall, in Virgil, 
what it is to feel: 

moods, half-moods, 
swarming, then darting loose; obscure
hunches that refuse
to speak, but still expect

in some flash of   luck
to be revealed. The less you try
to notice them,
the more they will know of  you."
65,Sun In Days,Meghan O'Rourke,"1 

I tried to live that way for a while, among
the trees, the green breeze, 
chewing Bubblicious and by the edge of the pool      spitting it out. 
The book open on my chest, a towel
at my back      the diving board thwoking,
and leaving never arrived      Cut it out
my mother said     my brother 
clowning around with a water gun     Cut it out.
The planes arrowed into silence, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, always coming 
home from summer     over the bridge to Brooklyn.
The father stabbed on Orange Street,
the Betamax in the trash, 
the Sasha doll the dog chewed up, hollow 
plastic arms gaping. Powdered pink lemonade, 
tonguing the sweet grains 
                                                       liquid-thick. 
I could stand in that self   for years
wondering is it better to 
anticipate than to age     Imagining 
children with five different men,
a great flood that would destroy 
your possessions     and free you to wander. 
Bathing suits and apples and suntan oil
and a mother bending over you
shadow of   her face on yours. It’s gone,
that way, the breeze, the permanent pool.
A father saying “ghost” and the sheets
slipping off   the oak tree’s bough.
When I wake, leaves 
in the water. You could say green
forever and not be lying.

The pond near the house in Maine
where we lived for one year 
to “get away” from the city     the pond
where the skaters     on Saturdays came,
red scarves     through white snow,
voices drawing near and     pulling
away, trees against the clouds. Trying to live
off   the land for a while. Too hard
in the end my father said.     What did he say? 
Forget it     you weren’t listening     He wore
fishing overalls most days and stank of   guts.
Our shouts slipping, the green garbage cans
edging the white scar pond,
so many days like secrets about to be
divulged . . .
                                         White snow;
to stink of   fish guts but     to be trying
to live:               the pond near the house
and the sound of   voices     drawing near.

As you aged you got distracted, indebted. 
In the hospital around my mother
the machines     beeped,
the long leads of   the heart monitor,
drooping parabolas. 
It’s not worth dying for     she said. What
was it she meant? Swollen shells, the desiccated brown 
seedpods we used to pinch onto our noses 
and skate about     putting on airs. 
Then the books opened
their pages and with our red woolen
scarves flying and the Freezy Freakies’ 
once-invisible hearts reddening 
into the cold we disappeared. 
Evian bottles skitter against the chain-link fence.
It’s gone     that way     the green 
planes arrowing into silence     gum wrappers
slipping to the ground.
O wild West Wind     be thou our friend 
and blow away the trash. 
Salvage us from     the heap of our making and
Cut it out my mother said     Stop worrying
about the future, it doesn’t
belong to us and we don’t belong to it.

The surface more slippery, slick
and white the ice. I stand at the pond’s edge 
gather the information     darkening there 
hello algae     hello fish pond 
my mind in the depths     going. 
On the beach I dig, tunnel 
to the hands of   the woman who stitched 
this red shirt     holes all the way to China.
It got so easy to     get used to it, 
the orchestration of meaning 
against the night, life 
a tower you could climb on
not a junk heap     pale picture books
yellowing on the shelves. It got 
so     I close my eyes 
and walk along the hospital hall.
The iris quivering in the March light,
a nurse taking my mother’s pulse
not paid enough to help us 
as we wished to be helped. And your hope 
left behind     turning the pages of   magazines, 
the models in Prada. As a girl
it was a quest, to feel exploded every second,
pudding pops     and Vietnam vets 
standing on the corner shaking their Styrofoam
cups.     Holding her 
cup my mother stands, petting the dog,
it’s 1982     the sun tunneling in     she drinks her coffee
Cut it out or     Forget it or     Hello. 
Look, I’ve made a telephone for us.
Put that cup to your ear, and I’ll put it to mine,
and listen     I just need to find
one of those Styrofoam cups 
and what about you     where did you
go what kind of night is it there 
electric synthetic blackened or burnt.

At night they come to you
distorted and bright, like an old print on a light box, 
present,     present,          not quite. 
Are we inventing them as we sleep, 
or are they still     happening
in a time we can’t touch?
The hockey game on the blue
tv glowing and slowing     I come home 
to a man slumped on the couch not-quite-saying
a greeting     all the gone ones there 
the slap of skates     all gone
and the commentator it’s going on forever
the blade moving along rink
says What a slapshot what a shot.
You make a life, it is made of days and
days, ordinary and subvocal, not busy 
becoming what they could be,               dark furlings of 
tiny church feelings, mysterious, I mean,
and intricate like that high-windowed light —

intricate and mysterious          I come home. 

Near our house we hung out 
on the Promenade after school the boys smoking
the security systems in the Center blinking     a disco 
party blue red / blue red the East River
reflecting scraped sky     cornices and clouds
we could hear the roar of cars across 
it and taste the chemical air
of   the offices the fathers worked in
we’d been there to pick them up 
for the long weekend in the Catskills
the hum-gray computers, the ibm Selectrics 
massive on the desks, eleven, twelve, 
thirteen, riding the graffitied subways,
flirting, the boys     grabbing us calling     hey     hey.
Changeable one day to the next.
Jon talking of atheism

over the Statue of   Liberty, white 
blinding everywhere.          Oh, she said, don’t worry

Everyone is scared of   Russia. 
Imagine          she laughed     We used to 
have to hide under our desks! 

Forget it     you weren’t listening     I was trying
Don’t worry it gets you nothing
to tell you something     the air cold 
the maples bare your mother pregnant
Come on the horses are     past the window
with a son much younger than you
of   the house she rode them past
the river where all the Catholic kids sailed ice boats
uncles taking cash to wire home to Ireland.
The future isn’t here yet, it’s always
going to be,     but I’m holding you,
walking the Promenade, thirty-six,
the ferry crossing the river again.

In the meantime you try 
not to go into a kind of exile —
Oh, you read too many books, says my friend
Dan     Here’s the tv. And the small voices
of children     enter the room, they sound
so narrow and light and possible. But
don’t you think we’re always making the same
standing at the car rental
kind of mistake we began by making
at the last minute, rushing to call
our fathers before setting off 
for vacation.     It’s warmer 
this August than it has been for decades.
Still the sun bathing us isn’t preposterous
or cold.          Grace: imagine it

and all the afterworld fathers sleeping
with their hair perfectly          combed
faces mortician-clean

the dairy case goose-pimpling my skin.
Those tiles are still there.
She is dead now     and so is he.
I know it seems bare to say it
bare to     bare linoleum tiles.

68,Tombo,W. S. Di Piero,"In Safeway yesterday, a young man sat on the floor, 
           pulled off   his shoes, granted audience to us, 
his fellow seekers, and picked his naked feet. 
           He smiled, our brother, at the story he told 
of   deliverance at the hand of   Master Tombo, 
           lord and creator, whose round energy
lives in us surrounds us surrounds our milk
           our butter our eggs: see Him there,
in the Slurpee glaze upon the freezer case?
           In that elder by the yogurt shelves?
I believed his happiness and coveted 
           a tidy universe. He picked his feet
while a child whimpered by the melons, her nanny’s
           mango aura made the cold blown air
touch my brain, I smelled myself in my aging body 
           and felt my silly bones collapse again.
I wanted Tombo’s dispensation to save
           this faint believer and the indifferent world
that rivers through and past me. Down my aisle 
           lavender respired from the flower stall
and Security spoke kind words to our prophet.
          Oh I love and hate the fickle messy wash
of speech and flowers and winds and the tides
           and crave plain rotund stories
to justify our continuity. To the Maya corn was god,
           spilled blood made corn grow,
the blood gods shed watered needy ground
           and became People who worshipped the corn.
Tombo’s grace carries us, convinced, from one 
           inarticulate incoherent moment to the next.
Tonight the wet streets and their limelight sigh.
          Orion turns, burning, unchanged again.
Bread rises somewhere and its ovens scent the trees.
           My poor belief   lives in the only and all
of   the slur of   what these are, and what these are 
          streams toward loss in moments we live through.
As children we were lost in our opaque acts 
           but fresh and full in time. I remember
how I touched a girlish knee, how one boy
           broke another’s face, how we all stood
in hard gray summer rain so it would run
          down the tips of noses to our tongues."
69,Trust,Liz Waldner,"If   I would be walking down the road
you told me to imagine and I would and find
a diner kind of   teacup sitting on its saucer
in the middle then I would feel so good
in my life that is just like mine
I would walk right up and look into my face
eclipsing the sky in the tea in the cup
and say, “Thank you, I have enjoyed
imagining all this.”"
71,Water Table,Eliza Griswold,"My earliest wish was not to exist,
to burst in the backyard 
without violence, 
no blood, no fleshy bits, 
mute button pressed
alone behind the rectory 
where no one would see me.

This wasn’t a plea to be found 
or mourned for, but to be unborn 
into the atmosphere. To hang 
in the humid air, as ponds vent upward 
from the overheated earth,
rise until they freeze
and crystallize, then drop 
into the aquifer."
72,The Witch Has Told You a Story,Ava Leavell Haymon,"You are food.
You are here for me
to eat. Fatten up,
and I will like you better.

Your brother will be first,
you must wait your turn.
Feed him yourself, you will
learn to do it. You will take him

eggs with yellow sauce, muffins
torn apart and leaking butter, fried meats
late in the morning, and always sweets
in a sticky parade from the kitchen.

His vigilance, an ice pick of   hunger
pricking his insides, will melt
in the unctuous cream fillings.
He will forget. He will thank you

for it. His little finger stuck every day
through cracks in the bars
will grow sleek and round,
his hollow face swell

like the moon. He will stop dreaming
about fear in the woods without food.
He will lean toward the maw
of   the oven as it opens

every afternoon, sighing
better and better smells."
74,"[At last, to be identified!]",Rebecca Hazelton,"A dirigible powered us through the first leg,
            traversing snow-capped mountains where goats
leapt from crags, and men with wrinkled
            apples faces looked up, pointed.

Smiling
            to cold air, I slept under a bear skin,
                        touched your lips in the night.

            On our pleasant soap
bubble journey, we dropped baskets down
            each morning, hooked meats, cheeses;
            in later weeks, nothing. Still, we took notes,

detailing the weather conditions, the migrating
            elk numbers and their steady decrease.
Northward by cracked compass,
            the sleet sheeting the balloon drove us low, then lower—

In time we cut through the ice, sank
fathoms into the sea, chaperoned by seals
            that are not mermaids at all.

Else you think this a hoax, know my hand—
down here still—please send help."

76,Book of Memory,Rebecca Hazelton,"In my seeing there was a blank and he filled that blank
with words, there were words for darkness which made it lift,
there were words for cover which ripped them off,
there were legs that crossed and hearts that crossed,
promises red and read, and the pluck of banjo had a name
for that twang, and the way he called the world into notice,
that had a word, too. Once I saw I couldn’t unsee
and the worst was that the light glaring from the letters
left blue haze under my eyelids. There are no photographs
of this time, and I can only go by what others
tell me: I was blurred and erratic, I drew a circle
of white chalk around me and called myself inviolate,
I watched for horses on the horizon, my walls
were under siege from smaller men who called themselves
heroes. They say I reached over the balustrade and picked
up the tiny ships and threw them over the edge of the world.
I tore my hair, cut one breast from my body and plattered it
as around my fortifications one man pulled another man
behind his chariot. If they say that’s how I was,
that’s how I was. I have no words for the one in the mirror
who apes me every morning. She’s not the one I remember
imagining as a young girl. There must be a way to unsee
how I tap the glass and she taps back, and which wall,
which Cassandra weeping—everything I saw I spoke to his ear,
and the wall crashed into place between us, the horse
had a bellyful of it, the blank was full of small soldiers,
and he turned from my beauty and said my name."
77,The Islands of Africa,Philip Lamantia,"to Rimbaud

Two pages to a grape fable
dangles the swan of samite blood
shaping sand from thistle covered fog
Over sacred lakes of fever
(polished mouths of the vegetable frog
rolling to my iron venus)
I drop the chiseled pear
Standing in smoke filled valleys
(great domains of wingless flight
and the angel’s fleshy gun)
I stamp the houses of withering wax
Bells of siren-teeth (singing to our tomb
refusal’s last becoming)
await the approach of the incendiary children
lighting the moon-shaped beast

Every twisted river pulls down my torn-out hair
to ratless columns by the pyramid’s ghost
(watered basin of the temple stink)
and all the mud clocks in haste
draw their mermaid-feather swords
(wrapped by Dust) to nail them
into the tears of the sea-gull child
The winter web minute
flutters beneath the spider’s goblet
and the whores of all the fathers
bleed for my delight"
78,A Little Washington DC Dream,Philip Lamantia,"The Due D’Aumal’s cannonballs
Are being marshmellowed 370 years from their masonic inception

Split
Through mirror teeth Washington D.C.
Black City of white rectangular bits of fear
Blown fluff of fear
O the Duke of Aumal’s balls are raging
Yellow vermin white houses of fear
And beautiful funky people
Diamond heart D’Afrique
Human blood human need
Black booming emotional vibes of life
White geometry of abstract cerebral death
I really saw at Fort McNair
In front of American General’s mansion
A fir-tree tied down to a black coffiny box
Jefferson’s phantom always rides tonight
There’s a solar splendor burst from Eighteenth-Century Cannon of the Due D’Aumal
I’m sure Citizen Lafayette was no dixiecrat"
79,Mama’s Boy,Tyrone Williams,"for Michel Tournier, The Four Wise Men

At least once a month a man
boards a bus bound for Detroit,
one bag, a few books. Nevertheless
he always tells himself
I just might
leave Cincinnati for good
just cut out
never look back...

When he arrives in the Motor City he drinks
and drinks it all in until he’s dead drunk
on all fours, a two-year-old
mama’s boy, bawling
all night night after night
for the salt-sweet milk of his sister-mother
turning in her sleep from a hard back
turning toward the Canadian border...

When at long last he takes
a bus back to the Queen City,
long after the only rest
stop, he notices the first
signs: merciless thirst,
gorging hunger, swollen ankles,
what the folks down south
call sugar."
80,Meadowlark West,Philip Lamantia,"Choppers in the night husk the brilliants of thought
Beyond the cities of patina grow caves of thought
Coyote Hummingbird Owl are rivers of thought
The lumens the pumpkins dance: pits of correspondence over the land
Birds the dream tongues warble Iroquois Mojavé Ohlone
Market Street of “The Mad Doctor” via the occult centers
A gang of fox spirits at the crossroads
 Bandoleros set between the obliteration of grizzly bears painted by an Arcimboldist and the monstrance of bleeding chains
Montezuma’s feathery headdress torn up in the boondocks of the Rosy Cross

Coyote girls in myth-time
At the central dream of edenic treasures
The irrevocable annihilation of christian civilization is taking shape with carnivorous flowers of volcanic thought"
81,Questions About the Wife,Rebecca Hazelton,"I’m having trouble understanding the wife.
The wife seems like she is only there as a foil to your actions.
I want to know how the wife feels when you drag her
and your son down into the basement to start a new religion.
The religion has something to do with cowering
before a force greater than yourself and then being buried alive.
I want to know how the wife behaves in small, enclosed spaces:
if she is trying to comfort your son by telling him Daddy likes
to play funny games, or if she is already visualizing
herself walking into a women’s shelter, your son
on her back and maybe, because this is a fantasy,
she carries a burning torch, like an angry villager, or a goddess.
Does the wife merit any revenge after you weed whack
the coffee table? Does she agree with you that the coffee table
is yours to destroy because you built it? What has she built
in the house that is hers to destroy? What kind of childhood
has the wife endured that allows her to understand you?
In her past life or lives, was the wife ever a shepherdess?
Does she see you as a sort of Pan, goatish, and pricked
by ticks, but also very well-endowed? When the wife transforms
into a tree can she still think or is she just a green haze
inside, an idea of growing? I would like to see the wife
peel off that bark, leaving only enough for modesty’s sake,
although as this is your poem, we can take a bit more off.
I want to see her uproot herself, pick up the house and shake it.
How many people fall out?
The wife has something about her the Germans
would call unheimlich. I sometimes catch a glimpse of the wife
out of the corner of my eye but then I look away.
I cannot look directly at the wife. The wife is a conflagration
of everything dear. I wonder sometimes if she is faking;
There is a certain note she holds too long
so the orgasm is more operatic, less genuine.
When she cries, Oh my God, really, she should stutter.
Let’s say the wife wakes up in the morning.
You have already made breakfast. Does your kindness feel oppressive?
Does she want to take your weed whacker through the house?
Has she ever, in a fit of anger, destroyed your pornography?
When you found a picture of the wife online with a foreign handprint
smacked red on her ass, how quickly did your shock turn to arousal?
Are you aware the wife is breaking down in public places,
and sometimes cannot move for thirty minutes? Sometimes
her arm goes entirely numb from the shoulder down. I think the wife
might need some fine-tuning, some elbow grease,
some wrenching apart, and then reassembling."
82,[To Love thee Year by Year—],Rebecca Hazelton,"They call it sacrifice—            imagine me a tiny poppy
            on a field of green felt—brief blip of color,

                        limitless expanse. I’ve never felt foreign,
or like a lash in his eye. If it’s not love, it’s

                        very like. Most days it feels the same—
            exacting—he tweezes the stray

thoughts from my speech, cleans up my
            heart with a tortoiseshell comb.
Every lady should have such a man,
            edging her lawn with a sharp rotary blade.

                        Year by year—let’s call it always—
            editor and editrix. Engaged
                        against a flurry of typos, showered in

revisionist white out. I erase his crow’s feet,
            buff away his frown. My head—he
yawns it open, scoops out dark foam,
            yesses I’ve regretted, the tiny poppy
everyone sees flapping to pieces—

And so, we are growing taller, sweeter,
ratified in the glow of the big correction."
83,Vow,Rebecca Hazelton,"They were not traditionalists.
They could bear the innovations
               of plot. They could not
wait to landscape the plot. They had plans
                              for a bed of pansies because pansies
                              hardly ever die
                                                            in a cold snap,
                              because pansies are hardy despite the name.
When they shoved the trowel
                                             into the soil
it was with his hand
                                             on the handle and hers                                                                            adding force.
They knew there were only
                                                            nine types of people in the world
and they knew which ones
would close the deal. They knew
the shirkers by sight.
                                             They had options.
They knew about Required Communication.
                              About how I feel and you feel.
When there was a question
                                             of who did the dishes
                                             and who did the cat box,
                                             it was settled in-house
                              and never required an outside contractor.

But the pansies got stem spot, leaf rot, and mildew.
When they looked at their options
               it seemed there weren’t really that many
                                                                                            after all.
They swore to uphold the bonds
                                                      and the principles
                                                      and the yelling.
They swore to oral sex.
They dressed to the nines and they walked the aisle.
They stood up and received the standard narration."

Have you ever been in a situation
where somebody you thought was your friend
did something that hurt you very much,
and then they tried to blame it on you,
and then you had a heart attack?
Just wondering.

I thought Jack Abramoff was my buddy—
a small fish with a large chicken.
What a dick.

Why’d he have to remind me of my first wife,
Jacqueline Bouvier-Kennedy-Onassis-Bono-Crowe-Pitt-Degeneres-Federline?

Of course, that speaks volumes to and of itself.

On the other hand, everything tastes like chicken.
And cooked people taste like butter.

Then I ate hot beignet and sludgy chicory
and I accidentally drove the hot ‘n’ sporty.
Now I may try the chicken fries.

Why poo’ed vindaloo?

The founding fathers risked life and limb
just so I could trust the kung pao ham.
But the former potions master
spiked my polyjuice with mango juice,
and now I like drinks with chicks in them.

Doesn’t anyone care about my feelings?
All I wanted to do was kill little birds.
Because, you know, that’s fun.

I forget, which one am I banging,
that Plame bitch or the Ambassador to Switzerland?
I’d ask Dick which of the two he’s screwing
but he never answers my emails.

In other news, I’ve been up to my neck in new food intern activity.
The skewers are kind of like hot wings,
except they are made with chicken tenders.
The backwash is kinda long,
but watch the whole thing for the slo-mo matrix-esque finale.
Way cooler than any other stick figure theater.

A barn-raised quail just said
“Bugs Bunny isn’t real.”

Is there no end to the horrors
this shooting will reveal?"
89,[I rose from marsh mud],Lorine Niedecker,"I rose from marsh mud,
algae, equisetum, willows,
sweet green, noisy
birds and frogs

to see her wed in the rich
rich silence of the church,
the little white slave-girl
in her diamond fronds.

In aisle and arch
the satin secret collects.
United for life to serve
silver. Possessed."
90,Pushkin,Philip Nikolayev,"Talking like Pushkin to his horse, I climb
into thick equestrian aesthetics. I’m
horseman and veterinarian in one
on an estate of troubled youth, I am
an aristocratic fop, hello,
galloping at full gallop shooting at treetops,
yahoo to you Sir in treble multiplication,
I know about stallions and I’m
out of here to the city soon, I must meet
N. or K., I forget which, and then the zisters C.
Sorry, I mean the sisters Z.
My sideburns incinerate the furniture in the salon
of Y. I do not care
for C++ , for I live in the nineteenth century.
I barely lived through math at the Lycée.
I’m now dans une boutique.
Vous ne parlez pas français? Merde, vous êtes alors
crétin, mon vieux monsieur le barbecue!
What are you a Volga Tatar or something?
Actually I’ve never been to Kazan but I wanna go
some day, maybe when the emperor exiles me.
You look familiar, I know you from somewhere.
So what brings you to St. Petersburg on
this particular twist of the century?
Lozenges of the imagination climb
reflected in the Neva of the sky
and in the sky of the Neva and farther
along the Nevkas, and the stars, the stars
shine viscerally like old duel scars
anticipated. I am stuck at home.
I’ll never see you, Paris, London, Rome.
Adrenal memory flows and gels and burns,
acting in combination with my sideburns.
I’ll show you some transculture. Gospoda,
do you understand any Russian, ah?
Nyet? Damn, then I must speak to you in English."
91,Vegan Symphony #9,Philip Nikolayev,"Roaring roast cake with bean base spareribs for me,
carottes étouffées medium rare,
I like them a tad undercooked, still red
with sap, tea leaves in olive oil,
strawberry sushi flummoxed
to the point of deliquescence,
or better still, freshly picked
cucumber rolls to match
the lettuce steak, mesquite broiled
to a crunchy andante, with all
organic granola salsa, nuts
nutritious to the max, and then of course the
soypork casserole with legs
of boletus, and tofu chops on a platter
of tomato paste base salmon with
a sprinkling of beet juice droplets,
all served with a rich broccoli broth."
92,[Were it but Me that gained the Height—],Rebecca Hazelton,"World like a coat, silver clasps,
            ermine lined, warm with the dead inside,
rolling around in the red center—I thought

everything had a purpose—this was back when
            I still drank—and wasn’t I a special
traveler, nestled in that pocket amongst the

butterscotch candies, the matchbooks?
            Unessential but accounted for, a steady
thing to touch. World like a

morning glory, withered every
            evening, world like a bristling dog,
terrified of thunder—I can’t believe

how I believed, or how that belief
            assumed a shape around my body,
taking on the imprint of my heat,

gaining solidity. When
            anyone questioned me, I held
it forth, let them touch the sleeve—I

needed nothing. World like an
            egret, still and white on the highway
divider, world like a regret

typed out and then erased—I cannot
            hold you any closer without
everyone seeing, I cannot

hold you at all, it seems, your
            evergreens, your curling potato vine;
it’s all too much much, and I a bit of

goosedown, a thistle fluff, naked and
            hatless, unaccounted for and extra,
the world like a world like a world."
93,A Colander of Barley,Tami Haaland,"The smell, once water has rinsed it,
is like a field of ripe grain, or the grain held
in a truck, and if you climb the steel side,
one foot lodged on the hubcap, the other
on the wheel, and pull your body upward,
your hands holding to tarp hooks, and lift toes
onto the rim of the truck box, rest your ribs
against the side, you will see beetles
and grasshoppers among the hulled kernels.
Water stirs and resurrects harvest dust:
sun beating on abundance, the moist heat
of grain collected in steel, hands
plunging and lifting, the grain spilling back."
94,Dog Bite,April Lindner,"The worst for him was his friend turned wolf,
and the blood that splattered as he ran. The worst
for us: the hospital, his upper lip tugged back
to show the gash—the flesh halved deeply,
cleanly—while I hold him for the needle
that rubs pain out. He submits
to the quick stitch, the thread black
against pink skin, calm now he sees
the doctor can be trusted, his voice
soothing, his face clean shaven,
the clues that signal kindness to a child.
He’s worried, though, about his pet
who didn’t mean it, Mom. His voice is flat.
He knows the months he’s tried to woo this dog
were over when it leapt for his throat
and caught his mouth. The scars, at least,
will be invisible. At home, he’ll sleep,
big boy between his parents, till he’s sure
no beast will tear into his dreams. And we
will want him there, our bodies makeshift walls.
We who led the stranger to our home,
fixed him a bowl, taught him to sleep
under our blankets, we who taught our son
to rub the muzzle that sheathes the teeth."
95,A Garden’s End,Gabriel Welsch,"Forsythia, scaled and bud-bangled,
I pruned to a thatch of leaves
for the curb, by the squirrel-gnawed
corn, silk strewn, kernels tooth carved
and husks shorn over the ground
pocked with paw prints.

The borers mashed the squash vine,
the drought tugged the roots of sage,
catmint languished by the sidewalk,
tools grew flowers of rust.

That winter we left our hope
beneath the snow, loved through the last
of the onions, watched the late leeks freeze
to crystal, bent like sedges, their shadows
on the snow. That winter we left
our hope beneath the snow."
96,The Good Life,Tracy K. Smith,"When some people talk about money
They speak as if it were a mysterious lover
Who went out to buy milk and never
Came back, and it makes me nostalgic
For the years I lived on coffee and bread,
Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday
Like a woman journeying for water
From a village without a well, then living
One or two nights like everyone else
On roast chicken and red wine."
97,A Grandfather,Marie Thurmer,"We waded in the shallows,
holding his hands, then just
fingertips, as his feet
slowly lifted off the bottom.
The land did not stop
at the waterline, but simply
became unreachable.
His worn face bobbed above
the waves, breath in an O
as our words, fistfuls
of shimmering minnows,
scattered, lost on their way
to him. The tide carried
him out, then back a bit,
a gradual letting go into dark
waters, and we, still
in the ebb, could almost
mistake that O
for the response we wanted—
on the ins, I’ll remember you,
on the outs, goodbye."
98,Little Parka,Debra Nystrom,"Dream of Mom’s red parka gone—
someone stole it right out of the closet
of the burned-down house—what
good could it do anybody else, broken
zipper that always got caught,
she’d jimmy it loose, just part
of putting it on—and she was so tiny,
the arms too short even for me,
too-tiny gloves in the pockets, thumbs
stubby, practically useless to anyone
but her—they deserve it if they shove in
a hand, find the tissue she used and then
left there who knows which cold day,
what she needed it for, or why."
99,What It Looks Like To Us and the Words We Use,Ada Limón,"All these great barns out here in the outskirts,
black creosote boards knee-deep in the bluegrass.
They look so beautifully abandoned, even in use.
You say they look like arks after the sea’s
dried up, I say they look like pirate ships,
and I think of that walk in the valley where
J said, You don’t believe in God? And I said,
No. I believe in this connection we all have
to nature, to each other, to the universe.
And she said, Yeah, God. And how we stood there,
low beasts among the white oaks, Spanish moss,
and spider webs, obsidian shards stuck in our pockets,
woodpecker flurry, and I refused to call it so.
So instead, we looked up at the unruly sky,
its clouds in simple animal shapes we could name
though we knew they were really just clouds—
disorderly, and marvelous, and ours."
100,Winter Sunrise Outside a Café,Joseph Hutchison,"Near Butte, Montana

A crazed sizzle of blazing bees
in the word EAT. Beyond it,

thousands of stars have faded
like deserted flowers in the thin

light washing up in the distance,
flooding the snowy mountains

bluff by bluff. Moments later,
the sign blinks, winks dark,

and a white-aproned cook—
surfacing in the murky sheen

of the window—leans awhile
like a cut lily . . . staring out

into the famished blankness
he knows he must go home to."
101,Caelica 83: You that seek what life is in death,Baron Brooke Fulke Greville,"You that seek what life is in death, 
Now find it air that once was breath. 
New names unknown, old names gone: 
Till time end bodies, but souls none.
            Reader! then make time, while you be,
            But steps to your eternity."
102,Church Monuments,George Herbert,"While that my soul repairs to her devotion, 
Here I intomb my flesh, that it betimes 
May take acquaintance of this heap of dust; 
To which the blast of death's incessant motion, 
Fed with the exhalation of our crimes, 
Drives all at last. Therefore I gladly trust

My body to this school, that it may learn 
To spell his elements, and find his birth 
Written in dusty heraldry and lines ; 
Which dissolution sure doth best discern, 
Comparing dust with dust, and earth with earth. 
These laugh at jet, and marble put for signs,

To sever the good fellowship of dust, 
And spoil the meeting. What shall point out them, 
When they shall bow, and kneel, and fall down flat 
To kiss those heaps, which now they have in trust? 
Dear flesh, while I do pray, learn here thy stem 
And true descent: that when thou shalt grow fat,

And wanton in thy cravings, thou mayst know, 
That flesh is but the glass, which holds the dust 
That measures all our time; which also shall 
Be crumbled into dust. Mark, here below, 
How tame these ashes are, how free from lust, 
That thou mayst fit thyself against thy fall."
103,The Cruel Mother,All Poets,"She sat down below a thorn,
     Fine flowers in the valley;
And there she has her sweet babe born,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

""Smile na sae sweet, my bonnie babe,""
     Fine flowers in the valley,
""And ye smile sae sweet, ye'll smile me dead,""
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

She's taen out her little penknife,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
And twinn'd the sweet babe o' its life,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

She's howket a grave by the light o' the moon,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
And there she's buried her sweet babe in,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

As she was going to the church,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
She saw a sweet babe in the porch,
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

""O sweet babe, and thou were mine,""
     Fine flowers in the valley,
""I was cleed thee in the silk so fine,""
     And the green leaves they grow rarely.

""O mother dear, when I was thine,
     Fine flowers in the valley,
Ye did na prove to me sae kind,""
     And the green leaves they grow rarely."
104,Elegy for Philip Sidney,Baron Brooke Fulke Greville,"Silence augmenteth grief, writing increaseth rage,
Staled are my thoughts, which loved and lost the wonder of our age; 
Yet quickened now with fire, though dead with frost ere now, 
Enraged I write I know not what; dead, quick, I know not how.

Hard-hearted minds relent and rigor's tears abound, 
And envy strangely rues his end, in whom no fault was found. 
Knowledge her light hath lost, valor hath slain her knight, 
Sidney is dead, dead is my friend, dead is the world's delight.

Place, pensive, wails his fall whose presence was her pride; 
Time crieth out, My ebb is come; his life was my spring tide. 
Fame mourns in that she lost the ground of her reports; 
Each living wight laments his lack, and all in sundry sorts.

He was (woe worth that word!) to each well-thinking mind 
A spotless friend, a matchless man, whose virtue ever shined; 
Declaring in his thoughts, his life, and that he writ, 
Highest conceits, longest foresights, and deepest works of wit.

He, only like himself, was second unto none, 
Whose death (though life) we rue, and wrong, and all in vain do moan;
Their loss, not him, wail they that fill the world with cries, 
Death slew not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.

Now sink of sorrow I who live—the more the wrong! 
Who wishing death, whom death denies, whose thread is all too long; 
Who tied to wretched life, who looks for no relief, 
Must spend my ever dying days in never ending grief.

Farewell to you, my hopes, my wonted waking dreams, 
Farewell, sometimes enjoyëd joy, eclipsëd are thy beams. 
Farewell, self-pleasing thoughts which quietness brings forth, 
And farewell, friendship's sacred league, uniting minds of worth.

And farewell, merry heart, the gift of guiltless minds, 
And all sports which for life's restore variety assigns; 
Let all that sweet is, void; in me no mirth may dwell: 
Philip, the cause of all this woe, my life's content, farewell!

Now rhyme, the son of rage, which art no kin to skill,
And endless grief, which deads my life, yet knows not how to kill, 
Go, seek that hapless tomb, which if ye hap to find 
Salute the stones that keep the limbs that held so good a mind."
105,The Glories of Our Blood and State,James Shirley,"The glories of our blood and state
     Are shadows, not substantial things; 
There is no armour against Fate; 
     Death lays his icy hand on kings: 
               Sceptre and Crown 
               Must tumble down, 
And in the dust be equal made 
With the poor crooked scythe and spade.

Some men with swords may reap the field, 
     And plant fresh laurels where they kill: 
But their strong nerves at last must yield; 
     They tame but one another still: 
               Early or late 
               They stoop to fate, 
And must give up their murmuring breath 
When they, pale captives, creep to death.

The garlands wither on your brow;
     Then boast no more your mighty deeds!
Upon Death's purple altar now
      See where the victor-victim bleeds.
               Your heads must come
               To the cold tomb:
Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in their dust."
106,The Lullaby of a Lover,George Gascoigne,"Sing lullaby, as women do, 
Wherewith they bring their babes to rest, 
And lullaby can I sing too 
As womanly as can the best. 
With lullaby they still the child, 
And if I be not much beguiled, 
Full many wanton babes have I 
Which must be stilled with lullaby.

     First lullaby my youthful years; 
It is now time to go to bed, 
For crooked age and hoary hairs 
Have won the haven within my head. 
With lullaby, then, youth be still; 
With lullaby content thy will; 
Since courage quails and comes behind, 
Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.

     Next, lullaby my gazing eyes, 
Which wonted were to glance apace. 
For every glass may now suffice 
To show the furrows in my face; 
With lullaby then wink awhile, 
With lullaby your looks beguile; 
Let no fair face nor beauty bright 
Entice you eft with vain delight.

     And lullaby, my wanton will; 
Let reason's rule now reign thy thought, 
Since all too late I find by skill 
How dear I have thy fancies bought; 
With lullaby now take thine ease, 
With lullaby thy doubts appease. 
For trust to this: if thou be still, 
My body shall obey thy will.

     Eke lullaby, my loving boy, 
My little Robin, take thy rest; 
Since age is cold and nothing coy, 
Keep close thy coin, for so is best; 
With lullaby be thou content, 
With lullaby thy lusts relent, 
Let others pay which hath mo pence; 
Thou art too poor for such expense.

     Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes, 
My will, my ware, and all that was. 
I can no mo delays devise, 
But welcome pain, let pleasure pass; 
With lullaby now take your leave, 
With lullaby your dreams deceive; 
And when you rise with waking eye, 
Remember then this lullaby."
107,The Man of Double Deed,All Poets,"There was a man of double deed,
Who sowed his garden full of seed;
When the seed began to grow,
'Twas like a garden full of snow;
When the snow began to melt,
'Twas like a ship without a belt;
When the ship began to sail,
'Twas like a bird without a tail;
When the bird began to fly,
'Twas like an eagle in the sky;
When the sky began to roar,
'Twas like a lion at my door;
When my door began to crack,
'Twas like a stick across my back;
When my back began to smart,
'Twas like a penknife in my heart;
And when my heart began to bleed,
'Twas death, and death, and death indeed."
108,The Old Cloak,All Poets,"This winter's weather it waxeth cold,
              And frost it freezeth on every hill, 
         And Boreas blows his blast so bold
              That all our cattle are like to spill. 
         Bell, my wife, she loves no strife;
              She said unto me quietlye, 
         Rise up, and save cow Crumbock's life!
              Man, put thine old cloak about thee!

He.   O Bell my wife, why dost thou flyte?
               Thou kens my cloak is very thin: 
          It is so bare and over worn,
               A crickè thereon cannot renn. 
          Then I'll no longer borrow nor lend;
              For once I'll new apparell'd be; 
          To-morrow I'll to town and spend;
              For I'll have a new cloak about me.

She.  Cow Crumbock is a very good cow:
              She has been always true to the pail;
          She has helped us to butter and cheese, I trow, 
              And other things she will not fail.
          I would be loth to see her pine.
              Good husband, counsel take of me:
          It is not for us to go so fine—
              Man, take thine old cloak about thee!

He.   My cloak it was a very good cloak,
              It hath been always true to the wear; 
          But now it is not worth a groat:
              I have had it four and forty year'. 
          Sometime it was of cloth in grain:
              'Tis now but a sigh clout, as you may see: 
          It will neither hold out wind nor rain;
              And I'll have a new cloak about me.

She.  It is four and forty years ago
              Sine the one of us the other did ken; 
          And we have had, betwixt us two,
              Of children either nine or ten: 
          We have brought them up to women and men:
              In the fear of God I trow they be. 
          And why wilt thou thyself misken?
              Man, take thine old cloak about thee!

He.   O Bell my wife, why dost thou flyte?
              Now is now, and then was then: 
          Seek now all the world throughout,
              Thou kens not clowns from gentlemen: 
          They are clad in black, green, yellow and blue,
              So far above their own degree. 
          Once in my life I'll take a view;
              For I'll have a new cloak about me.

She. King Stephen was a worthy peer;
              His breeches cost him but a crown; 
          He held them sixpence all too dear,
              Therefore he called the tailor 'lown.'
          He was a king and wore the crown,
              And thou'se but of a low degree: 
          It's pride that puts this country down: 
              Man, take thy old cloak about thee!

He.   Bell my wife, she loves not strife,
              Yet she will lead me, if she can; 
          And to maintain an easy life
              I oft must yield, though I'm good-man. 
          It's not for a man with a woman to threap,
              Unless he first give o'er the plea: 
          As we began, so will we keep,
              And I'll take my old cloak about me."

112,Jook Joint Saturday Night,J. Patrick Lewis,"Jook joint's about to come alive!
It's like a bee outside a hive;
And when the hive begins to hum,
It's like a dim and distant drum;
And when the drum begins to beat,
It's like a circus down the street;
And when the street begins to fill,
It's like a sudden summer chill;
And just as summer simmers down,
It's like the fireworks over town.

This congregation's here to stay
'Cause when the jook joint comes alive
Is when the Delta blues arrive!"
113,Dear Ra,Johannes Göransson,"Dear Ra,

There are no more cigarettes in this letter. It's all about spray-paint and traffic jams from here on out. Honk if you're epileptic, honk if it's 2:40 p.m., if you love shells. Honk in the name of freedom and fear of the human body. When I say ""human body"" I mean the kind that tears like lettuce. And when I say ""fear"" I mean the kind you feel seconds before crashing into a wall. That's the kind of poem this is. The kind raised on excess television violence.

All that's left are ads for brotherhood and blowjobs. An ad for 2:42 p.m. A wad of hair. This isn't Marx. I'm not trying to bite the hand that feeds me sour candy. Run down the deer. Rain. Wear a red jacket and pumps. Pave the road back from my bed. I don't own a bed, it must've been the trap I've crept in and out of since I learned how to sleep alone. The Count of Monte Cristo's funeral. God's earlobe. An army of lamb can stop a film but not the violence of handbags. Not 2:43 p.m. Two forty-four pee em. Speak from a babble and a switch. Piss in a telephone booth. Grow a tree. Kidnap a car thief. Talk to him as though you want to be slammed in his trunk like a bag full of rocks.

Talk to me in the woods. To my chest. With your fingers.

Even if you kick in the gates, nyc is still nyc. My concussion is still a hotel. The guests are staying lukewarm and I'm picking up the tab. Ask me if I have ever wanted to tear out cables, burn up cradles. Interview my architects about hands. Ask an illegal immigrant how to escape from a political cliche. Does one use hammers? What about the moist area? The brutal caress? The spindle? Where does one learn to speak such a broken language? Are you jealous of films about Vietnam?

This poem is dedicated to Jean-Luc Godard. This poem is dedicated to the man who put a gun in my gullet. This poem is a pay-phone.

Listen to my concert through walls that were built to keep the vermin out of my armpits. Shovel. That's all I ask in return for my sonata on gravel. I mean gravel in a dialectic sense. As in, tomorrow dirt will be glamorous. Asphalt will be categorized as a sound. You will be categorized as an outdated method of psychotherapy. Like confession. Or the couch. Or the chair. I will be classified as a sore loser. Last year's winner must have thrown something hard at my head. Something that shattered like a waltz in a bomb raid. It's almost three o'clock. That makes it exactly several thousand miles since I left your town. I left your mice. I left a confusing note for the exterminators.

I've been confused when I should have been
reborn as a crusade or a hospital of innocents.
I've been bored when I should've been screwed.
I've been a hungry year."
114,Dear Tourists,Johannes Göransson,"Dear Tourists,

You can grope for moist souvenirs in the basement,
but you'll need patience
because nobody down there will warn you about the floor.

In the street you'll find squirrels; on my scalp, bumps.
If you want proof for the folks back home that you've surged
like a seagull, print your name and number in the bathroom.

If you want a seagull for a pet, talk to my therapist.
If you find her, tell me where she lives, and where her daughter
goes to school. If you want a piece of me, suck my dick.

If you want to sell trips to the general public, take my pulse
or my coffee-table picture-books about Italy.
If there's a house in the trees, throw up a hammer

and see what falls down. The bleeding kid isn't
the best prize and you can't return it, so be careful where
you walk when you've had a few.

If there's a nettle between your shoulder blades
and you're having trouble breathing, tell the teacher,
but don't tell her it was me cause it wasn't.

I was just watching, maybe even laughing at your gurgling sounds.
That incident belongs to somebody else's amusement park.
I don't ever want to see it again on this side of the blunt tracks."
115,Lady Day,J. Patrick Lewis,"for Billie Holiday

Lady could pour you a song,
Coffee and a little cream.
Stir it the whole night long
Into a brown-sugar dream.

Lady could wrap you a note
Up in a velvet night—
Sometimes Manhattan satin,
Always Harlem delight.

Lady Day could sing it
Like nobody ever has
At the Shim Sham Club, Hot Cha Cha,
Joints that swung on jazz.

Her bittersweet songs told Heartbreak,
Meet your sister Pain,
But Lady melted yesterdays
Into beautiful rain."
116,Nurse Marble,Johannes Göransson,"Knowledge is Power. That is what the billboard says and I agree. I am an adult, therefore I understand the threat of passengers. The threat to Our Children, who don't understand the threat of these bird-like, twitchy people. They pose two kinds of threat. To begin with, there is the one we all know about, the preda­tory threat, the hawk-like passengers that prey on children as they sit in front of their computers or televisions. The terrorist threat. That threat is easy to handle. You shoot it. You contain it. You confiscate. You stitch. You bleed from various orifices and sockets, but you survive, you rebuild house and rinse the child. The more serious threat is the diseases passengers carry with them. Internal terrorism. Children love those diseases. It makes them babble like possessed. Their make-up looks like oil in the moonlight. Such children cannot be cleaned off. Kill them. Or turn them into entertainment. Art."
117,"Swim, Girl, Swim",J. Patrick Lewis,"for Gertrude Ederle

As Europe woke from sleep,
Young Trudy Ederle
At Cap Gris Nez in France
Dived into a daunting sea.

Many had tried to make
This superhuman swim—
Thirty-five punishing miles.
Chances, at best, were slim.

When Fury found the waves,
Far from the western shore,
Her trainer shouted, ""Let's turn back!""
But Trudy cried, ""What for?""

Under an English moon,
The celebration began
After the fastest crossing
By woman or by man."
118,You Learn By Living,J. Patrick Lewis,"for Eleanor Roosevelt

Who showed the world the world itself
     Was awkward, shy and plain.
A high-born leader in a long,
     Low decade full of pain.

Poor farmers, blacks, homeless, the least
     Advantaged hoped to see,
Magnificently unarrayed,
     Pure human dignity.

A lady first, the great first lady
     Looked fear in the face,
And said, There is no room for fear
     When courage take its place."
119,Abecedarian Requiring Further Examination of Anglikan Seraphym Subjugation of a Wild Indian Rezervation,Natalie Diaz,"Angels don’t come to the reservation.
Bats, maybe, or owls, boxy mottled things.
Coyotes, too. They all mean the same thing—
death. And death
eats angels, I guess, because I haven’t seen an angel
fly through this valley ever.
Gabriel? Never heard of him. Know a guy named Gabe though—
he came through here one powwow and stayed, typical
Indian. Sure he had wings,
jailbird that he was. He flies around in stolen cars. Wherever he stops,
kids grow like gourds from women’s bellies.
Like I said, no Indian I’ve ever heard of has ever been or seen an angel.
Maybe in a Christmas pageant or something—
Nazarene church holds one every December,
organized by Pastor John’s wife. It’s no wonder
Pastor John’s son is the angel—everyone knows angels are white.
Quit bothering with angels, I say. They’re no good for Indians.
Remember what happened last time
some white god came floating across the ocean?
Truth is, there may be angels, but if there are angels
up there, living on clouds or sitting on thrones across the sea wearing
velvet robes and golden rings, drinking whiskey from silver cups,
we’re better off if they stay rich and fat and ugly and
’xactly where they are—in their own distant heavens.
You better hope you never see angels on the rez. If you do, they’ll be marching you off to
Zion or Oklahoma, or some other hell they’ve mapped out for us."
120,After,Fady Joudah,"Over treasure and land some texts will say it had
Little to do with slavery or the newly
Discovered yellow planet

Few men watched the glaciers recede
From shuttles they had built
During the hemorrhage years
When they’d gathered all the genes down from the ledges

I’ll be a fig or a sycamore tree
Or without hands

By then doctors and poets
Would have found a cure for prayer

 
•

Or have you shoved the door shut
In the face of the dark?

Have you body and light the trap
Of retribution doing unto you

What it does to others? You protest
In the streets and papers and I leave

For a faraway land
Where with pill and scalpel

And a distant reckoning
If he should lick his lips

Or clench his fist I shall find his second left toe
Infected puffy

From a bump
I’ll lance it and squeeze

Out the pus and offer
Him an antibiotic

I can’t refuse therefore I am

 
• 

The first time I saw you it was hot I was fed up
The second time your wife gave birth to a macerated boy

I had nothing to tell you
About letting go of the dying
In the morning you were gone

Had carried your father back to your house
His cracked skull
I didn’t know that was your wife
When I raised my voice

To those who were praying
From behind the wall to keep it down

I was trying to listen to your baby’s heartbeat
With a gadget a century old

 
•

Anemic
From so much loss giving birth

If you give blood in the desert you won’t
Get it back not your iron pills or magic hat
I put your thin
Hemoglobin up to the light and called out

To the donors Donors
If you want to know your blood type
And it’s a match
You must donate

Few came some indifferent to my condition
Not having heard of it
And willing anyhow

 
•

And the world is south
The night a bandit with gasoline

And I’m your dancing lizard mirth
I put my one arm up
And bring my one foot down on a hot zinc top
The nearest hospital was the dawn

She didn’t know her daughter on her back was
The entry wound and she the exit

She ran a brothel so
The officer said

Where the rebels came and went
And ran into the government boys

Her girl’s femur the size of the bullet

 
•

He was from the other side rumors
Had a bullet through his left arm
Or had it bitten off by a camel

A camel elephant of the desert never forgets what you are
If you aren’t kind to it

When I met him his bladder was the size
Of a watermelon his prostate a cantaloupe
You cannot catheterize
A man forever

Every hour on the hour his left arm stump
Hanging his good arm holding
His penis his buttocks in deep squeeze
A charge from the rear without spillage

This poor murderous thief desperately single-
Handedly began slapping his own ass
As if he were dashing a stallion in a raid
On some unarmed village

 
•

The mind in the field
The brine in the field

Whether I
Is a diphthong codependent on

What isn’t there to stay in the field
The good you act is equal

To the good you doubt
Most have lost many

You are either prosperous
Or veteran in the field

 
•

A mother offers not necessarily
Sells her one-eyed son

For an education if you’ll bring him back
And stone dust for one
With congenital illness

And little boy with malaria
Same old gas

Money mixed with blood
Transfusion the doctor’s perfect record broken

Nobility of taking
A life you

Who must walk to and from your house
The jeep’s upkeep
The donkey-cart ambulance

One boot left behind

The one-boot photo I wanted
On a book military black the quad a clinic’s

Special Forces spun
By his dangling heels from

The pickup truck rushed
To a central town altered combative

With two scalp lacerations and blood
In his auditory canal

I was a lover of loss I tossed
The boot in the capital of suffering"
121,The Facts of Art,Natalie Diaz,"woven plaque basket with sunflower design, Hopi, 
                                              Arizona, before 1935

                                              from an American Indian basketry exhibit in
                                              Portsmouth, Virginia

The Arizona highway sailed across the desert—
     a gray battleship drawing a black wake,
            halting at the foot of the orange mesa,
                  unwilling to go around.

Hopi men and women—brown, and small, and claylike
      —peered down from their tabletops at yellow tractors, water trucks,
            and white men blistered with sun—red as fire ants—towing
                  sunscreen-slathered wives in glinting Airstream trailers
                         in caravans behind them.

Elders knew these bia roads were bad medicine—knew too
     that young men listen less and less, and these young Hopi men
           needed work, hence set aside their tools, blocks of cottonwood root
                 and half-finished Koshari the clown katsinas, then
                        signed on with the Department of Transportation,

were hired to stab drills deep into the earth’s thick red flesh
     on First Mesa, drive giant sparking blades across the mesas’ faces,
           run the drill bits so deep they smoked, bearding all the Hopi men
                 in white—Bad spirits, said the Elders—

The blades caught fire, burned out—Ma’saw is angry, the Elders said.
     New blades were flown in by helicopter. While Elders dreamed
            their arms and legs had been cleaved off and their torsos were flung
                  over the edge of a dinner table, the young Hopi men went
                         back to work cutting the land into large chunks of rust.

Nobody noticed at first—not the white workers,
     not the Indian workers—but in the mounds of dismantled mesa,
           among the clods and piles of sand,
                 lay the small gray bowls of babies’ skulls.

Not until they climbed to the bottom did they see
     the silvered bones glinting from the freshly sliced dirt-and-rock wall—
           a mausoleum mosaic, a sick tapestry: the tiny remains
                 roused from death’s dusty cradle, cut in half, cracked,
                        wrapped in time-tattered scraps of blankets.

 Let’s call it a day, the white foreman said.
     That night, all the Indian workers got sad-drunk—got sick
          —while Elders sank to their kivas in prayer. Next morning,
                as dawn festered on the horizon, state workers scaled the mesas,
                        knocked at the doors of pueblos that had them, hollered
                               into those without them,

demanding the Hopi men come back to work—then begging them—
     then buying them whiskey—begging again—finally sending their white
          wives up the dangerous trail etched into the steep sides
                to buy baskets from Hopi wives and grandmothers
                       as a sign of treaty.

When that didn’t work, the state workers called the Indians lazy,
      sent their sunhat-wearing wives back up to buy more baskets—
           katsinas too—then called the Hopis good-for-nothings, 
                 before begging them back once more.

 We’ll try again in the morning, the foreman said.
     But the Indian workers never returned—
          The bias and dots calls to work went unanswered,
                as the fevered Hopis stayed huddled inside.

The small bones half-buried in the crevices of mesa—
     in the once-holy darkness of silent earth and always-night—
          smiled or sighed beneath the moonlight, while white women
                in Airstream trailers wrote letters home

praising their husbands’ patience, describing the lazy savages:
     such squalor in their stone and plaster homes—cobs of corn stacked
         floor to ceiling against crumbling walls—their devilish ceremonies
               and the barbaric way they buried their babies,
                      oh, and those beautiful, beautiful baskets."
122,Mimesis,Fady Joudah,"My daughter
                        wouldn’t hurt a spider
That had nested
Between her bicycle handles
For two weeks
She waited
Until it left of its own accord

If you tear down the web I said
It will simply know
This isn’t a place to call home
And you’d get to go biking

She said that’s how others
Become refugees isn’t it?"
123,My Brother at 3 A.M.,Natalie Diaz,"He sat cross-legged, weeping on the steps
when Mom unlocked and opened the front door.
         O God, he said. O God.
                He wants to kill me, Mom.

When Mom unlocked and opened the front door
at 3 a.m., she was in her nightgown, Dad was asleep.
         He wants to kill me, he told her,
                 looking over his shoulder.

3 a.m. and in her nightgown, Dad asleep,
 What's going on? she asked. Who wants to kill you? 
         He looked over his shoulder.
                 The devil does. Look at him, over there.

She asked, What are you on? Who wants to kill you? 
The sky wasn’t black or blue but the green of a dying night.
         The devil, look at him, over there. 
                 He pointed to the corner house.

The sky wasn’t black or blue but the dying green of night.
Stars had closed their eyes or sheathed their knives.
         My brother pointed to the corner house.
                 His lips flickered with sores.

Stars had closed their eyes or sheathed their knives.
 O God, I can see the tail, he said. O God, look. 
         Mom winced at the sores on his lips.
                 It’s sticking out from behind the house.

 O God, see the tail, he said. Look at the goddamned tail. 
He sat cross-legged, weeping on the front steps.
         Mom finally saw it, a hellish vision, my brother.
                 O God, O God, she said."
124,No More Cake Here,Natalie Diaz,"When my brother died
I worried there wasn’t enough time
to deliver the one hundred invitations
I’d scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary:
 Because of the short notice no need to rsvp.
Unfortunately the firemen couldn’t come.
(I had hoped they’d give free rides on the truck.)
They did agree to drive by the house once
with the lights on— It was a party after all.

I put Mom and Dad in charge of balloons,
let them blow as many years of my brother’s name,
jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls,
fistfights, and er visits as they could let go of.
The scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling
like they’d been filled with helium. Mom blew up
so many that she fell asleep. She slept for ten years—
she missed the whole party.

My brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding
his stained T-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up
into the air like confetti.

When the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out
the front door. They seemed to know where
they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins
at the end of our cul-de-sac. The clowns played toy bugles
until the air was scented with rotten raspberries.
They pulled scarves from Mom’s ear—she slept through it.
I baked my brother’s favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting).
When I counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen.
We all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.

A few stray dogs came to the window.
I heard their stomachs and mouths growling
over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom.
(There was no room in the hallway because of the magician.)
The mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics.
I told the dogs, No more cake here, and shut the window.
The fire truck came by with the sirens on. The dogs ran away.
I sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.

I wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house,
taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them—
remote controls, the Polaroid, stereo, Shop-Vac,
even the motor to Dad’s work truck—everything
my brother had taken apart and put back together
doing his crystal meth tricks—he’d always been
a magician of sorts.

Two mutants came to the door.
One looked almost human. They wanted
to know if my brother had willed them the pots
and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom.
They said they missed my brother’s cooking and did we
have any cake. No more cake here, I told them.
 Well, what’s in the piñata? they asked. I told them
God was and they ran into the desert, barefoot.
I gave Dad his slice and put Mom’s in the freezer.
I brought up the pots and pans and spoons
(really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them
together like a New Year’s Day celebration.

My brother finally showed up asking why
he hadn’t been invited and who baked the cake.
He told me I shouldn’t smile, that this whole party was shit
because I’d imagined it all. The worst part he said was
he was still alive. The worst part he said was
he wasn’t even dead. I think he’s right, but maybe
the worst part is that I’m still imagining the party, maybe
the worst part is that I can still taste the cake."
125,Birth,Fady Joudah,"1


 

Three sparrows in the schoolyard while waiting for my daughter to finish up her play with friends whose purity she will come to question in a few weeks and in that way I am reminded of the president when he speaks of enemies to the other side of the mirror but only in that way the three sparrows ruffled up the dirt as their wings and heads spun motorbike doughnuts after one of them had come back with a massive potato chip for the other two to fight over perhaps he was the provider or wasn’t hungry but simply couldn’t let a good bit of food go to waste

 


Then a crow came and the winner sparrow went zooming into the orange orchard knowing fully well it would be impossible to alight and reappeared with a chip the size of his beak and a flurry of birds descended on the scene (I even saw a Fletcher) but kept my eyes on that little sparrow and am happy to report he kept what his mouth held though it occurs to me he was also mean and the one who seemed a provider might have been yoked in that way my wife during delivery was rung up like a bar code whenever the nurse knocked or the doctor was called

In the room there were women


Counting up to ten dressed in blue


The doctor was also


Pregnant in her final week


The neonate came out broke


The sound barrier and was whisked


Away from the mother the father


Had cut the cord having held


Scissors before he couldn’t turn down


The doctor’s offer as if he would


Have denied someone an entry


Or exit visa


Then the women were gone


And neighbors and friends had to go


To work and the mother was alone


With breast or formula milk


One nurse suggested the latter


Was the better soporific

An infant smile


A gas tickle


The price of milk


It goes up in war


My son is here to teach me


My temperament is genetic


His smile is blind


It dreams a spandrel


Turns opiate in the eyes


He grunts impatient wants


Gas out as soon as


It forms in peace


He coos


It’s what doves do


Though excitable


Observant of moving lips


Attempts utterance


Throws up happy spit


And hunger’s renewed"
126,Archibald Higbie,Edgar Lee Masters,"I loathed you, Spoon River. I tried to rise above you,
I was ashamed of you. I despised you
As the place of my nativity.
And there in Rome, among the artists,
Speaking Italian, speaking French,
I seemed to myself at times to be free
Of every trace of my origin.
I seemed to be reaching the heights of art
And to breathe the air that the masters breathed,
And to see the world with their eyes.
But still they’d pass my work and say:
""What are you driving at, my friend?
Sometimes the face looks like Apollo’s,
At others it has a trace of Lincoln’s.""
There was no culture, you know, in Spoon River,
And I burned with shame and held my peace.
And what could I do, all covered over
And weighted down with western soil,
Except aspire, and pray for another
Birth in the world, with all of Spoon River
Rooted out of my soul?"
127,"Petit, the Poet",Edgar Lee Masters,"Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, like mites in a quarrel— 
Faint iambics that the full breeze wakens— 
But the pine tree makes a symphony thereof. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Ballades by the score with the same old thought: 
The snows and the roses of yesterday are vanished; 
And what is love but a rose that fades? 
Life all around me here in the village: 
Tragedy, comedy, valor and truth, 
Courage, constancy, heroism, failure— 
All in the loom, and oh what patterns! 
Woodlands, meadows, streams and rivers— 
Blind to all of it all my life long. 
Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus, 
Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick, 
Tick, tick, tick, what little iambics, 
While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines?"

by new surroundings, I miss
the bright feeling of belonging
and the familiar patterns of my country,
its virginity and schizophrenia,
my several stolen bicycles."
129,Convention Centers of the New World,Raymond McDaniel,"We had to sleep in the streets.
Not on the sidewalks, in the streets.

Cause the sidewalks was full of urine
and body waste, dead bodies.

And we had to sleep out there,
in the hell of waste and the dead bodies.

I walked from water up to my neck
to get to the Convention Center.

There was dead dogs, dead rodents,
you had to push all that kind of mess out of the way,

hoping that it didn’t touch you.
I was pushing them out the way,

so many dead bodies coming from the Ninth Ward
up our way and they had people that was drowned up my way.

Now this Convention Center wasn’t nothing nice,
I kid you not.

People still crying and begging to go home.
There’s nothing there.

You have no running water. You have no lights.
The place stinks. It’s contaminated.

I’ve been there twice.
I died there, I died.

Me, my ten-year-old daughter, my sister
and her thirty-two-year-old son,

we lived out there seven days.
Five days we had no food. No water.

Every night and every day the military people
was throwing down on us

like we was a bunch of wild animals.
They was on a hunt to kill.

They killed one guy right there in front of us,
run over him with a police car

and then they shot the man and left him there.
They didn’t cover him up or nothing

and the next day,
it was so hot out there,

when they did come to pick him up,
his body was stuck to the ground.

So I can understand you want to keep control
of the people,

but why have those people draw guns on children?
Women with babies in their stomachs.

Every time you look around we breaking and running,
trying to get into the Convention Center

and they’re drawing guns on people like that.
I mean, it don’t make no kinda sense.

They wouldn’t let you leave.
You had to stay there.

Cause we smelled like — I’m serious —
because everybody was smelling the same way —

smelling like sewer, like shit, piss.
That was the scariest time of my life.

And we had to have that on us
because we ain’t had no water, we ain’t had no sewer.

There wasn’t no limit on it because you had to scrub yourself
just to get the scent out of your skin

Because, like I said, they knew they have a lot of poor people
like myself don’t have no transportation,

don’t have no money.
Well I have a car but it got under the water.

Me, my ten-year-old daughter, my sister
and her thirty-two year-old son, we lived out there seven days.

We looked for her for an hour and thirty minutes
in the Convention Center.

Five days we had no food. No water.
I seen children die, I seen old people die,

I seen murders, I seen rapes.
I seen people murder people then cut their heads off.

We already knew that the killer people
were putting them in the icebox,

killing little children and raping little children.
The men, the looters, the people that was staying in there.

I am telling you, that was the most horriblest experience
I have ever seen in my life.

I seen the troops shoot people. They ride around with guns
almost like we was in a prison camp.

No, the place wasn’t on fire. It was some children upstairs
playing with the fire extinguisher.

Like hell. And like I said, I never in my life grew up in a house
with millions of people.

You know, I’ve always had my own room, my own,
you know, my own, I was always — just —

In the Convention Center, the buses came in.
Every night. Every day they was telling us

“The buses is coming, the buses is coming.”
The buses passed right there in front of us and kept going!

The people was there to see the buses so everybody run,
rushing the buses to get on the damn buses and get out of there.

Every day they was moving us around, go here, go there,
the buses is gonna meet you here, meet you there.

They was lying. There was never no buses, they was lying.
They was just making us tired. They had us in there to kill us.

We used to look up at the bridge and see all the buses
going that way to the Superdome,

or to the hospital, or to the people in those condos,
getting them all out of there and going back.

Buses going back again, buses leaving out New Orleans again.
That’s how it was.

It was nopd police
but it wasn’t our regular district police.

These were special nopd policemen.
We was running from place to place telling them,

“Oh, this person dead, that person dead.”
They said, “Well we can’t do nothing about no dead bodies.

Y’all just don’t worry.
Y’all just try to get the fuck out of here.”

They say, “Y’all go to the bridge.
The bus’s going to pick you up on the bridge.”

I think it was they job to send the National Guards
and the armored people in there

to make sure everybody was evacuated.
They left us out there for five, six, seven days.

We stayed on the bridge nine hours.
They didn’t care about us.

The first thing they dropped into us was boxes of cigarettes.
Not food. Not water. Boxes of cigarettes.

Two hours later they drop us water. And half of it burst open
cause they was so high up when they dropped it.

Two hours after that they drop us some army food in a box
we got to pour water in to heat up.

We was hungry,
we had no other choice.

The news got us out. Not the National Guard, not the Mayor, not Blanco,
the news people is the only ones who got us out.

Channel 26 got me out. Channel 26.
The rest of them was there to kill us.

I got tired of Convention Centers. I wanted
to come the hell up out of that damn Convention Center."

131,Furthermore,Christina Davis,"It was something to let him go.

          It was a having to believe, furthermore,

in the voyage
of the other, a Ulysses

without an Ithaca,

was to speak
of the sea
without speech
of the shore—

and to have for a body

the going away of the body, to have for eyes
the going away of the eyes. And for hearing,

a silence, where once
were people.

And for comfort, a dwelling
before each
steps into that weather
of which all
strangers speak."
132,Going Home: New Orleans,Sheryl St. Germain,"for my grandmother, Theresa Frank

Some slow evenings when the light hangs late and stubborn in the sky,
gives itself up to darkness slowly and deliberately, slow cloud after slow cloud,
slowness enters me like something familiar,
and it feels like going home.

It’s all there in the disappearing light:
all the evenings of slow sky and slow loving, slow boats on sluggish bayous;
the thick-middled trees with the slow-sounding names—oak, mimosa, pecan, magnolia;
the slow tree sap that sticks in your hair when you lie with the trees;
and the maple syrup and pancakes and grits, the butter melting
slowly into and down the sides like sweat between breasts of sloe-eyed strippers;
and the slow-throated blues that floats over the city like fog;
and the weeping, the willows, the cut onions, the cayenne, the slow-cooking beans with marrow-thick gravy;
and all the mint juleps drunk so slowly on all the slow southern porches,
the bourbon and sugar and mint going down warm and brown, syrup and slow;
and all the ice cubes melting in all the iced teas,
all the slow-faced people sitting in all the slowly rocking rockers;
and the crabs and the shrimp and crawfish, the hard shells
slowly and deliberately and lovingly removed, the delicate flesh
slowly sucked out of heads and legs and tails;
and the slow lips that eat and drink and love and speak
that slow luxurious language, savoring each word like a long-missed lover;
and the slow-moving nuns, the black habits dragging the swollen ground;
and the slow river that cradles it all, and the chicory coffee
that cuts through it all, slow-boiled and black as dirt;
and the slow dreams and the slow-healing wounds and the slow smoke of it all
slipping out, ballooning into the sky—slow, deliberate, and magnificent."
133,Problems of Knowledge,Joshua Edwards,"Translation broadens language
as divorce and remarriage extend family.

Born to fade and break, facts
huddle inside black brackets.

Work means inquisition as a child
separates a cricket’s wings from thorax.

Ideas come apart as monads, metastasizing
rhapsody on the edge of delicate dusk.

Thunder sounds in the distance or television,
always on in this constant rain."
134,Solomon Grundy,Alice Oswald,"Born on Monday and a tiny
world-containing grain of light
passed through each eye like heaven through a needle.

And on Tuesday
he screamed for a small ear in which to hide.

He rolled on Wednesday, rolled his whole body
full of immense salt spaces, slowly
from one horizon to the other.

And on Thursday, trembling, crippled,
broke beyond his given strength and crawled.

And on Friday he stood upright.

And on Saturday he tested a footstep
and the sky came down and alit on his shoulder
full of various languages in which one bird doesn’t answer to another.

And on Sunday he dreamed he was flying
and his mind grew gold watching the moon
and he began to sing to the brink of speaking"
135,Some Months After My Father’s Death,Sheryl St. Germain,"I am watching the movie Twelve Angry Men
because there is a character in it
who reminds me of him.

He is the one who wants to go to the baseball game
instead of decide on a man’s life,
he is the weak one, the one afraid to reveal
what he really feels, the one for whom everything
is a joke. He is not Henry Fonda,
the tight-lipped moral one.

The man is despicable, his weaknesses obvious
to all, as obvious as Henry Fonda’s goodness.
I watch the movie again and again, loving
the black and white of it, soothed
by the sound of my father’s voice,
the careless pronunciation, the easy
shrugging of the shoulders at every crucial question.

I sink lower into the dark arms of the sofa.
Strange how comfortable the familiar is,
how we can even prefer it,
however terrifying."
136,Troubadour,Christina Davis,"Someone enters: That alone
makes me speak.

When you lived, I spoke to you.
We are transitive.

I never dream of speech:
I either speak or don’t.

And now that I know
where you will not be—

I do not go there."
137,Various Portents,Alice Oswald,"Various stars. Various kings.
Various sunsets, signs, cursory insights.
Many minute attentions, many knowledgeable watchers,
Much cold, much overbearing darkness.

Various long midwinter Glooms.
Various Solitary and Terrible Stars.
Many Frosty Nights, many previously Unseen Sky-flowers.
Many people setting out (some of them kings) all clutching at stars.

More than one North Star, more than one South Star.
Several billion elliptical galaxies, bubble nebulae, binary systems,
Various dust lanes, various routes through varying thicknesses of Dark,
Many tunnels into deep space, minds going back and forth.

Many visions, many digitally enhanced heavens,
All kinds of glistenings being gathered into telescopes:
Fireworks, gasworks, white-streaked works of Dusk,
Works of wonder and/or water, snowflakes, stars of frost . . .

Various dazed astronomers dilating their eyes,
Various astronauts setting out into laughterless earthlessness,
Various 5,000-year-old moon maps,
Various blindmen feeling across the heavens in braille.

Various gods making beautiful works in bronze,
Brooches, crowns, triangles, cups and chains,
And all sorts of drystone stars put together without mortar.
Many Wisemen remarking the irregular weather.

Many exile energies, many low-voiced followers,
Watches of wisp of various glowing spindles,
Soothsayers, hunters in the High Country of the Zodiac,
Seafarers tossing, tied to a star . . .

Various people coming home (some of them kings). Various headlights.
Two or three children standing or sitting on the low wall.
Various winds, the Sea Wind, the sound-laden Winds of Evening
Blowing the stars towards them, bringing snow."
138,Gliding O'er All,Walt Whitman,"Gliding o'er all, through all,
Through Nature, Time, and Space,
As a ship on the waters advancing,
The voyage of the soul—not life alone,
Death, many deaths I'll sing."
139,Dog in Bed,Joyce Sidman,"Nose tucked under tail,
you are a warm, furred planet
centered in my bed.
All night I orbit, tangle-limbed,
in the slim space
allotted to me.

If I accidentally
bump you from sleep,
you shift, groan,
drape your chin on my hip.

O, that languid, movie-star drape!
I can never resist it.
Digging my fingers into your fur,
kneading,
      I wonder:
How do you dream?
What do you adore?
Why should your black silk ears
feel like happiness?

This is how it is with love.
Once invited,
it steps in gently,
circles twice,
and takes up as much space
as you will give it."
140,Grubbing,Gabriel Spera,"The jay’s up early, and attacks the lawn
with something of that fervor and despair
of one whose keys are not where they always are,
checking the same spots over and again
till something new or overlooked appears—
an armored pillbug, or a husk of grain.
He flits with it home, where his mate beds down,
her stern tail feathers jutting from the nest
like a spoon handle from a breakfast bowl.
The quickest lover’s peck, and he’s paroled
again to stalk the sodgrass, cockheaded, obsessed.
He must get something from his selfless work—
joy, or reprieve, or a satisfying sense
of obligation dutifully dispensed.
Unless, of course, he’s just a bird, with beaks—
too many beaks—to fill, in no way possessed
of traits or demons humans might devise,
his dark not filled with could-have-beens and whys."
141,Labor Day,Joseph Millar,"Even the bosses are sleeping late
in the dusty light of September.

The parking lot’s empty and no one cares.
No one unloads a ladder, steps on the gas

or starts up the big machines in the shop,
sanding and grinding, cutting and binding.

No one lays a flat bead of flux over a metal seam
or lowers the steel forks from a tailgate.

Shadows gather inside the sleeve
of the empty thermos beside the sink,

the bells go still by the channel buoy,
the wind lies down in the west,

the tuna boats rest on their tie-up lines
turning a little, this way and that."
142,Noguchi’s Fountain,Helen T. Glenn,"The release of water in the base
so controlled that the surface tension,
tabletop of stability, a mirror,
remains unbroken. Moisture seeps
down polished basalt sides.

This is how I grieve, barely
enough to dampen river stones,
until fibers in my husband’s
tweed jacket brush my fingers
as I fold it into a box. How close
the whirlpool under my feet."
143,The Pull Toy,A.E. Stallings,"You squeezed its leash in your fist,
It followed where you led:
Tick, tock, tick, tock,
Nodding its wooden head.

Wagging a tail on a spring,
Its wheels gearing lackety-clack,
Dogging your heels the length of the house,
Though you seldom glanced back.

It didn’t mind being dragged
When it toppled on its side
Scraping its coat of primary colors:
Love has no pride.

But now that you run and climb
And leap, it has no hope
Of keeping up, so it sits, hunched
At the end of its short rope

And dreams of a rummage sale
Where it’s snapped up for a song,
And of somebody—somebody just like you—
Stringing it along."
144,Age Appropriate,Philip Schultz,"Sometimes, 
mystified by the behavior
of one of my sons, 
my wife will point out 
if   it’s age-appropriate, 
making me wonder why 
I still shout at ballplayers on tv 
and argue with the dead. 
Last week, my oldest son,
with a wild pitch, turned 
my left ankle into an eggplant. 
I didn’t yell at the doctors 
who refused my insurance, 
or get angry with a friend 
who told me to soak it 
in bourbon and garlic. No,
I read Montaigne who said 
self-revelation is the purpose 
of discourse, which, in his day, 
meant knowing whether 
to be flattered if a friend 
didn’t use a food-taster, 
or amused if a witch cast a spell 
of   weeping on an in-law. 
Blaise Monluc, the king’s 
lieutenant general during 
the civil wars, Montaigne says,
threw so many hanged Protestants
down a well you could reach in 
and touch the top one’s head. Yes,
Monluc, who was fond of saying 
“When the scaffolds are full, use trees,” 
knew what was appropriate. 
On occasion I’ll run into a lobby
to avoid greeting a friend, 
not because my mind vanishes 
and I can’t remember his name, 
which is true, but because I 
must flee what is darkest in me. 
In other words, when evicted from 
a strange lobby into a stranger street, 
where every scaffold is full 
and bodies dangle in the long 
blue sorrow of the afternoon, 
without context, explanation, or sympathy,
it’s good to know, even momentarily, 
how to live, among the relevant, 
the passionate, and the confused."
145,Allegory,James Longenbach,"1 

In the Forest of    Wearisome Sadness,
Where one day I found myself wandering alone,
I met my heart, who called to me, asking me where I was going.

The path was long and straight, row after row of conifers receding
To a horizon that because of   the geometry
Seemed farther than it really was,
Like the door at the top of a staircase in Versailles.

But as if   the forest’s maker had been offended by elegance,
A pile of rocks disrupted the rows: the forest once
Had been a field. I remember that field. 

I was carried there by my father, beside him 
My grandfather, who planted the trees. 
Until they were tall enough to survive,
He mowed the field, piling up rocks, taking down brush with a scythe.

How, since I’ve known the forest almost since birth, could I have been lost?
Why, since the forest is beautiful, is it not a place of delight? 

Repeatedly I asked these questions of my heart, 
But like a good physician, he elected 
To keep silent, leaving me to answer for myself.

 2 

Late at night, when I’m lying in bed and cannot sleep,
My heart reads to me from the Romance of   Pleasant Thought. 
Always I’ve heard the story before, and typically, 
Since the stories are true, I am their hero.

I’m riding my tricycle on the sidewalk near the house where I was born.
Because I am unsupervised, I indulge in what seems at the moment 
A daring wish: I ride the tricycle beneath a sprinkler.

Immediately I am overcome with remorse.
The evidence of my trespass is everywhere to be seen,
And for the first time in my life I contemplate a lie. 

Would my shirt dry faster if I stood in the sun, where it’s hot,
Or in the shade, where cool breezes rustle the leaves?

In the version of this story that appears now
In the Romance of Pleasant Thought,
I admire not so much my ingenuity
As the evidence of my early devotion to empiricism,
The way I manage terror by examining how things work. 

 3 

It’s done, there’s nothing more to say.
My heart is gone from me.
Because he has fallen in love
He has abandoned me.

It’s pointless making myself uncomfortable over this
By being mournful or sad.
It’s done, there’s nothing more to say.
My heart is gone from me.

He does nothing but mock me.
When I tell him pitifully
That I cannot live on my own,
He does not listen.
It’s done, there’s nothing more to say.

 After Charles d’Orleans 

 4 

Imagine you’ve been in love forever, since before you were born.
You walk the field. At every third step
You scoop out a handful of wheat
From the seed bag, scattering it broadcast.
As the sun comes up, you’re walking in a golden cloud.

Inside the cloud, time no longer exists.
Your back’s not bent, your body is a boy’s.

Outside, since it’s time for wheat, the summer rains are finished.
Otherwise it’s oats. Every third year it’s clover.
You’re tired of walking, of  sowing, tired of   being in love.

The advantage to people like you,
Though there are many disadvantages, is this:
When the earth no longer needs what you can grow

You plant hundreds, then thousands
Of seedlings, conifers, trees that bear no edible fruit.
You arrange them in rows, you tend them,
You’re proud of them.
You make the field disappear."
146,An Old One Walks,Gowann,"Snake walks with that old squiggly stick,
walks slow down by the waterfall,
from stone to stone down by the waterfall,
shuffling on his bare feet
while dancing on the edge of it.
Now shimmer that, now shimmer this,
while now just one,
an Old One steps the beat of it.
How may he walk with that old squirmy stick?
Soft, soft he goes,
and gathers sun.
Soft, soft he goes,
he has no bones.
Soft, soft he goes, 
and gathers wind.
About his neck, 
a bone flute hums the flux of it.
Something congeals and flows.
Snake says, just spirit matters."
147,Ancestry,Seán Hewitt,"The damp had got its grip years ago
but gone unnoticed. The heads of the joists
feathered slowly in the cavity wall
and the room’s wet belly had begun to bow.

Once we’d ripped the boards up, it all came out:
the smell, at first, then the crumbling wood
gone to seed, all its muscles wasted.
You pottered back and to with tea, soda bread,

eighty years shaking on a plastic tray.
One by one we looked up, nodded, then slipped
under the floor. We moved down there like fish
in moonlight, or divers round an old ship."
148,Another Thing,David Mason,"Like fossil shells embedded in a stone,
you are an absence, rimmed calligraphy,
a mouthing out of silence, a way to see
beyond the bedroom where you lie alone.
So why not be the vast, antipodal cloud
you soloed under, riven by cold gales?
And why not be the song of diving whales,
why not the plosive surf   below the road?

The others are one thing. They know they are.
One compass needle. They have found their way 
and navigate by perfect cynosure.
Go wreck yourself once more against the day
and wash up like a bottle on the shore,
lucidity and salt in all you say."
149,The Big Bad,David Orr,"At last we decoded the terminal message,
Only to find the pattern we had expected
Was false — a false trail of false bread crumbs
Designed to leave pitfalls undetected.

We found a new pattern. We found a hand
Moving pieces we had thought were only
Part of  the board, and shifting them to vantage points
We had ignored. We rewrote the battle plan

And reconfigured the satellite array
To show our progress from the very beginning.
The fault should be traceable — and hence correctable — 
And once we found it, we’d be winning.

We found a new pattern. We followed its track
To a forest beside an abandoned tunnel
Diving wide as a boxcar into the rock.
A stale breeze blew over rusting shovels

And all of our instruments confirmed a hit.
We set a perimeter. We sent in a scout.
From the interior, nothing looked back at us.
No tracks indicated a force had come out.

But we had a pattern. At dawn, we dispatched
A team of our best, our trackers and stone killers,
To see if  the signals were finally a match
And if so, to counterattack. And now we wait.

And now we wait. The tunnel gives nothing back.
The trees are revealing the first signs of gold
But the air is unmoving. The air is still.
It is quiet here, and getting cold."
150,Busker with Harp,David Orr,"For a birth

The fact of the harp swells into the air,
Alien and familiar and entirely too large,
An elephant lost in the suburbs,
And opens with its cry a strange passage

Between the harp itself, the fragile harp,
And the almost guilty knowledge
Of   the stroke of   luck that brought it here
And the care with which it must depart."
151,Catchy Tunes,Robert Thomas,"It’s not just this. Every written word is a suicide note.
And a love letter, too.

There may be no one to talk to who would get it,
but if you write it down maybe someone will get it after you’ve left the room,

or in five hundred years, or maybe someone from Sirius, the Dog Star,
will get it. The composer Karlheinz Stockhausen

claimed he was born on Sirius. You remember him:
the genius who said the crashing of planes

into the World Trade Center was the greatest concert ever held,
although he later conceded the audience had not been given the option

to not attend
and that somewhat diminished its perfection.

I heard Stockhausen interviewed at Davies Symphony Hall
before the orchestra played one of   his works

that sounded to me like the voices of   the parents
in A Charlie Brown Christmas if they’d been arguing about real estate.

No, I was not impressed by Karlheinz.
His daughter Christel was a flautist in the orchestra,

and she joined him for the interview
and said her father would take her and her brother out on the lawn

of their summer house outside Cologne
(this was years before he was on the cover of   Sgt. Pepper)

and teach them to read each constellation
as notes on a stave and to sing

the words of their favorite nursery rhymes to the stars’
melody: “The dog ran away in the snow” and

“Go get the sleigh in the cellar.” It was a game
but it was hard: work and play at once.

Their father explained to them,
“God does not write catchy tunes.”

You could tell she meant it to be a charming story,
but the audience sat in silence.

Suffer the little children."
152,Dawn at Saint Anna’s Skete,Scott Cairns,"Agion Oros, 2006

The air is cool and is right thick with birdsong
as our bleary crew files out, of a sudden 
disinterred from three sepulchral hours of prayer
into an amber brilliance rioting
outside the cemetery chapel. With bits
of   Greek and English intermixed, the monks
invite us to the portico for coffee, 
παξιμάδια, a shot of cold ρακί.
As I say, the air is cool, animate 
and lit, and in such light the road already 
beckons, so I skip the coffee, pound the shot, 
and pocket two hard biscuits. And yes, the way 
is broad at first, but narrows soon enough.

 παξιμάδια — pahximáthia — Greek biscotti; ρακί — rahkeé — Greek grappa"
153,The Delta,Bruce Bond,"If you are going there by foot, prepare 
to get wet. You are not you anymore.

You are a girl standing in a pool 
of clouds as they catch fire in the distance.

There are laws of   heaven and those of   place
and those who see the sky in the water,

angels in ashes that are the delta’s now. 
They say if you sweep the trash from your house

after dark, you sweep away your luck.
If you are going by foot, bring a stick,

a third leg, and honor the great disorder,
the great broom of waterfowl and songbirds.

Prepare to voodoo your way, best you can,
knowing there is a little water in things

you take for granted, a little charity
and squalor for the smallest forms of life. 

Voodoo was always mostly charity.
People forget. If you shake a tablecloth

outside at night, someone in your family
dies. There are laws we make thinking

it was us who made them. We are not us.
We are a floodplain by the Mississippi

that once poured slaves upriver to the fields.
We are a hurricane in the making.

We could use a magus who knows something
about suffering, who knows a delta’s needs.

We understand if   you want a widow 
to stay single, cut up her husband’s shoes.

He is not himself anyway and walks
barefoot across a landscape that has no north.

Only a ghost tree here and there, a frog,
a cricket, a bird. And if the fates are kind,

a girl with a stick, who is more at home, 
being homeless, than you will ever be."
154,Diluvian Dream,Wilmer Mills,"All afternoon I walk behind the mower,
Imagining, though paradoxically,
That even though the grass is getting lower,
What I have cut is like a rising sea;
The parts I haven’t cut, with every pass,
Resemble real geography, a map,
A shrinking island continent of grass
Where shoreline vanishes with every lap.

At last, the noise and smell of gasoline
Dispel my dream. What sea? Peninsulas?
They were the lands my inner child had seen,
Their little Yucatáns and Floridas.

But when I’m finished, and Yard goes back to Lawn,
I can’t help thinking that a world is gone."
155,Double Vision,Wilmer Mills,"At Waffle House, they fired her on the spot:
“You talk too much!” 
                                        She’d told her customers
That “made” gets “mad” and “poet” goes to “pot”
Without the letter e. The “amateurs,”
She’d said, “inherit everything: the sand,
The stars, the world that only God possesses.”

While washing dishes with a bleeding hand,
She’d told them, “through ‘possession’s’ double ‘esses’
There’s a line that cleaves; things come apart;
‘Refrain’ means both ‘hold back’ and ‘go again’;
Things join in wholes of which they are a part.”

She “touched” the people. Was it such a sin?
Her broken pencil left a double line
On my tab, both legible as one design."
156,The Exhibition Was Very Beautiful,Sandra Beasley,"The Traveler’s Vade Mecum, line 907

The exhibition opened on a rainy Thursday, with cello suite. 
They hung the paintings to be viewed from both front and back. 
Luna moths flapped their great green sail-wings.
Stingrays flapped their great gray sail-wings. 
Those visiting the exhibition were encouraged to touch. 
Captions were available in Braille and audio. 
The exhibition tasted like cherries. 
A critic asked if the exhibition was a “facile juxtaposition of   ideals.”
The mother of the exhibition calls constantly and the father, never.
The exhibition has taken to pouring a little scotch in the coffee. 
When designing layout, remember 
it is crucial how a bias cut fits at the exhibition’s hips
and foot traffic turns to the right, not the left. 
They hung the sculptures to be viewed from both above and below.
They painted the walls a shade of “eggshell, minus calcium.”
The exhibition did not consider itself an exhibitionist
until the incident at the east window.
The exhibition is very sorry and will refund upon request.
Stingrays flapped their great gray sail-wings. 
Luna moths flapped their great green sail-wings.
No matter how short a trip, the exhibition packs two pairs of shoes. 
The exhibition never knows when it is coming home again."
157,Flour Is Firm,Sandra Beasley,"The Traveler’s Vade Mecum, line 4234

Baking two parts flour to one part water 
could stop a bullet. So good soldiers 
carried their hardtack over their hearts. 
Break it down with a rifle butt, flood it, 
fry it in pig fat to make hellfire stew.
Gnaw it raw and praise the juice.

Does wheat prepare for this as it grows,
seeking the light in a half-thawed field?
Do stalks know their strength is merely 
in their number? What is ground down
we name flour in promise that it will be 
made useful. Otherwise, it’s just dust. 

Sheet iron crackers. 
Teeth-dullers.
Would you call it starving, if a man dies
with hardtack still tucked in his pocket?
Can you call it food, if the bullet comes only
at the moment he gives in and swallows?"
158,From “Mankindness”,Christina Davis,"1 

Because he, because she,

Not what is your name,

the battle?

“Each one of us has come
here and changed” —

is the battle. Born
a loved one,
borne a loved one.

My father fought in this war, thus I can speak of it.
My mother fought in this, thus I can speak.
My friends, my lovers have fought, have worn
(like the tree) their several directions at once. And I,

in so far as I
               can say “I”

have fought to be related to these —
we strive and strain
but also try to ripen the entity
of the Other.

 4 
We kiss on lips, where the tenses attach.

We enter the conundrum 
of another’s becoming.

We look for someone who can raise us 
up again to feet, or near to standing.

We tend in our terrors to forget (we 
do not store them) felicities.

160,The Gift,Robert Thomas,"When I got the box home from the gun shop, I let it sit on my kitchen table
in its wax wrapping for hours before I opened it.

Safe from the elements. Protected from rust
and more esoteric forms of corrosion.

My father gave me a rosewood chess set when I turned twelve.
I’d never felt so loved through and through, almost literally, as if  I were transparent —

and it probably wasn’t love, just a lucky, last-minute guess
at the toy store, which is probably what most love is, anyway.

I took the set into my room, shut the door,
determined to master every fork and zugzwang,

that strange position where you’d be safe
if only you didn’t have to make a move.

Now I’d given myself a perfect gift. I imagined the gun at rest
in a velvet sack next to its dainty box of   bullets. I wouldn’t need many.

And no sequined wrapping paper could have been more beautiful
than the brown waxed sheet the clerk had unrolled

and cut along the steel edge in one long, smooth stroke.
When I finally slit through the layers to open it,

the paper was as delicate and rich as sheets of pastry
in baklava, with a mass of dark chocolate in the center.

I’d never touched a gun. I loved how perfectly its handle fit
my hand: centuries of engineering and design

coming together in the “unit,” and I knew it would work.
Unlike toys, religious rituals, erotic techniques, and works of art,

I could depend on it. The only other device I own
that fulfills its function so well is my reading glasses,

and I used a soft gray cloth just like the one I clean them with
to wipe the oil from my fingertips

as I dropped the bullets one by one
into the somber chambers. I just need to know it’s there,

like the extra purse I keep hidden in the closet
with a money clip and a neatly folded change of clothes.

I don’t need a class in safety or marksmanship.
If I ever use it, it will be at close range.

It may be the only way to get rid of the stranger inside.
It may be the only way

to get inside someone I love
when every other route has been systematically barred."
161,Greed,Philip Schultz,"My ocean town struggles 
to pick up leaves, 
offer summer school, 
and keep our library open. 
Every day now 
more men stand 
at the railroad station, 
waiting to be chosen for work. 
Because it’s thought 
the Hispanics will work for less 
they get picked first, 
while the whites and blacks 
avoid the terror 
in one another’s eyes.
Our handyman, Santos, 
who expects only
what his hands earn, 
is proud of   his half acre in Guatemala, 
where he plans to retire. 
His desire to proceed with dignity 
is admirable, but he knows
that now no one retires, 
everyone works harder. 
My father imagined a life 
more satisfying than the one 
he managed to lead. 
He didn’t see himself as uneducated, 
thwarted, or bitter,
but soon-to-be rich. 
Being rich was his right, he believed. 
Happiness, I used to think, 
was a necessary illusion. 
Now I think it’s just 
precious moments of relief, 
like dreams of Guatemala.
Sometimes, at night,
in winter, surrounded by 
the significant silence
of empty mansions, 
which once were cottages, 
where people lived their lives, 
and now are owned by banks
and the absent rich, 
I like to stand at my window, 
looking for a tv’s futile flickering, 
always surprised to see 
instead
the quaint, porous face
of my reflection,
immersed 
in its one abundance."
162,I,Michael Ryan,"When did I learn the word “I”?
What a mistake. For some,
     it may be a placeholder,
     for me it’s a contagion.
For some, it’s a thin line, a bare wisp,
     just enough to be somewhere
     among the gorgeous troublesome you’s.
For me, it’s a thorn, a spike, its slimness
     a deceit, camouflaged like a stick insect:
     touch it and it becomes what it is:
ravenous slit, vertical cut, little boy
     standing upright in his white
     communion suit and black secret."
163,Idiot Psalm 12,Scott Cairns,"A psalm of Isaak, amid uncommon darkness

O Being both far distant and most near,
             O Lover embracing all unlovable, O Tender
             Tether binding us together, and binding, yea
             and tenderly, Your Person to ourselves,
Being both beyond our ken, and kindred, One
             whose dire energies invest such clay as ours
             with patent animation, O Secret One secreting 
             life anew into our every tissue moribund,
             afresh unto our stale and stalling craft, 
grant in this obscurity a little light."
164,Jewel of India,Sadiqa de Meijer,"From the dim hallway, walls swollen with summer damp.

Concave threshold to the morning’s livid light.

When my father said Gerrard Street East, his voice.

The passing subway tremors upwards, into me, reverberates in  ligaments and membranes. 

On canvas shoes through minor parks, a pinball in a rudderless machine.

My father, transiently animate. Funny in the ebbing language,  bantering with shopkeepers.

A lifeguard pours bleach in the fractured blue wading pool, sloshes it out with her legs.

If  I could, I’d view a produce stand as he did, fill a paper bag with dillweed, bitter melon, ladyfingers.

Miraculous reversal poster in the window of the Portuguese  apothecary.

Who lived where he never resembled somebody. 

Belled, metal restaurant elephant. They’re barely open. The woman fills and seals samosas in the uproar of a standing fan.

I have tea. Father, dayflower, I keep arriving at this dead end where the menu says exotic, stamped with sickle chilis. 

The fan blades clatter frantically in their cage. A ghetto blaster spools ghazals. 

Her husband, over the counter, shouts: The pavements here are very bad. You must take your walks on the pitch, in circles. This is what all of us do."
165,The King and Seer,Emily Warn,"The King asks, “Tell me, what is the highest meaning of the holiest truths?”
The Seer answers, “Emptiness, without holiness.”

The King is a restless seeker.
The Seer is a ruler and thief.

I am seriously watching how trees are always missing some leaves.
They sweep the air looking for them. Nothing distracts them. Nothing.
Where leaves are missing between the branches, beautiful sun porches, 
which disappear when the tree reaches them.

“Who are you?” the King asks.
“It is not like that,” the Seer says.

The Seer leaves the King alone in his throne room
and starts walking to China, kicking up gravel,
hurrying to find the next king.

On the road between country houses, 
he stops to listen to trees digging the air for crickets.
He wonders whether the King is mad now like the trees,
or dancing and recounting the story without an end."

You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blanketts, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race.                                      — General Jeffery Amherst in a letter dated  July 16, 1763

Over the warming ground, swings toll like clock tower bells.
Squirrels spiral the trunk of a pine.
We fill a pail with sand. 
The day is robin’s eggshell fine.

My mother’s shoulder had three shallow scars.
Shining archipelago.
The quiet theaters of our lives. 
Immune is a sung word, skirting sorrow.

Kneeling at no registry of toddlers with amorphous voices.
Night sweats without monument.
The lake has the sea on its breath.
One man has an island."
167,Lenten Song,Phillis Levin,"That the dead are real to us
Cannot be denied, 
That the living are more real

When they are dead
Terrifies, that the dead can rise
As the living do is possible

Is possible to surmise, 
But all the stars cannot come near
All we meet in an eye.

Flee from me, fear, as soot
Flies in a breeze, do not burn 
Or settle in my sight, 

I’ve tasted you long enough,
Let me savor
Something otherwise.

Who wakes beside me now
Suits my soul, so I turn to words
Only to say he changes

Into his robe, rustles a page,
He raises the lid of the piano
To release what’s born in its cage.

If   words come back 
To say they compromise 
Or swear again they have died,

There’s no news in that, I reply,
But a music without notes
These notes comprise, still

As spring beneath us lies, 
Already something otherwise."
168,On First Seeing a U.S. Forest Service Aerial Photo of Where I Live,James Galvin,"All those poems I wrote
About living in the sky
Were wrong. I live on a leaf
Of   a fern of   frost growing
Up your bedroom window
In forty below.

I live on a needle of   a branch
Of   a cedar tree, hard-bitten,
Striving in six directions,
Rooted in rock, a cedar
Tree made of other trees,
Not cedar but fir,

Lodgepole, and blue spruce,
Metastasizing like
Bacteria to the fan-
Lip of a draw to draw
Water as soon as it slips
From the snowdrift’s grip

And flows downward from
Branch to root — a tree
Running in reverse.
Or I live on a thorn on a trellis —
Trained, restrained, maybe
Cut back, to hold up

Those flowers I’ve only heard of
To whatever there is and isn’t
Above."
169,Pastorals in the Atrium,Sadiqa de Meijer,"The tour has only started when
I’m ambushed by that flat-lined verdigris I’d know even
as a stumbling sleepwalker: landschap
with tin river, cleaver of sodden pastures — 

marvelous for painters, 
says the docent, was the enormity
of the sky, rarely cloudless, and she’s already 
turning to an Italian hillscape when I say wait! this is 

my bloodstream, as my finger makes brief
unintended contact with the canvas,
and then my voice an ambulance 
I tell her there should be a diagram 
to indicate the grazing motion, 
how the grinding molars of the Holsteins
make the river go — 

or else, self-portrait 
in the glassing-over eye
of a stickleback caged in a jam jar, 
left too long in the sun — 

but now the river is across the room because 
the docent has ushered me toward an upholstered bench
and is murmuring, sit, sit, I have here from the staff room
a coffee, here you are — 

and I’m making the gesture for 
no, those fields I ate and was made of 
live in me, uncloseable 
parentheses"
170,Roadside Ditch Natura Morta,James Galvin,"No one can draw fast enough
To capture the cut
Iris before its form falls
From its former self.
But when we passed a patch
In the ditch,
She told me to stop and she stepped
Down, opening her clasp
Knife. She spared one iris
With an impressionistic
Cocoon on its stem
And cut the flower beside it.
Once home
She rendered in a careful hurry.
She drew into the night as the iris died.
I woke grafted to her
In a vague, translucent hammock of dread."
171,Salvations,Kay Ryan,"Like hope
it springs
eternal,
existing in
discrete but
spherical

each other no
walls collapse

172,Self-Help,Michael Ryan,"What kind of delusion are you under?
The life he hid just knocked you flat.
You see the lightning but not the thunder.

What God hath joined let no man put asunder.
Did God know you’d marry a rat?
What kind of delusion are you under?

His online persona simply stunned her
as it did you when you started to chat.
You see the lightning but not the thunder.

To the victors go the plunder:
you should crown them with a baseball bat.
What kind of delusion are you under?

The kind that causes blunder after blunder.
Is there any other kind than that?
You see the lightning but not the thunder,

and for one second the world’s a wonder.
Just keep it thrilling under your hat.
What kind of delusion are you under?
You see the lightning but not the thunder."
173,The Ships of Theseus,Steve Gehrke,"The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians    ...    for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.
— Plutarch, Vita Thesel

The answer of course is that the ship
doesn’t exist, that “ship”
is an abstraction, a conception,
an imaginary tarp thrown
across the garden of the real.
The answer is that the cheap
peasantry of things toils all day
in the kingdom of  language,
every ship like a casket
of words: bulkhead, transom,
mast steps. The answer
is to wake again to the banality
of things, to wade toward
the light inside the plasma
of ideas. But each plank
is woven from your mother’s
hair. The blade of each oar
contains the shadow of
a horse. The answer
is that the self is the glue between
the boards, the cartilage
that holds a world together,
that self is the wax in
the stenographer’s ears,
that there is nothing the mind
won’t sacrifice, each item
another goat tossed into
the lava of our needs.
The answer is that this is just
another poem about divorce,
about untombing the mattress
from the sofa, your body
laid out on the bones of the
double-jointed frame, about
separation, rebuilding, about
your daughter’s missing
teeth. Each time you visit
now you find her partially
replaced, more sturdily
jointed, the weathered joists
of   her childhood being stripped 
away. New voice. New hair.
The answer is to stand there
redrawing the constellation
of   the word daughter in
your brain while she tries
to understand exactly who
you are, and breathes out
girl after girl into the entry-
way, a fog of   strangers that
almost evaporates when
you say each other’s
names. Almost, but not quite.
Let it be enough. Already,
a third ship moves
quietly toward you in the night."
174,A Thank-You Note,Michael Ryan,"For John Skoyles

My daughter made drawings with the pens you sent,
line drawings that suggest the things they represent,
different from any drawings she — at ten — had done,
closer to real art, implying what the mind fills in.
For her mother she made a flower fragile on its stem;
for me, a lion, calm, contained, but not a handsome one.
She drew a lion for me once before, on a get-well card,
and wrote I must be brave even when it’s hard.

Such love is healing — as you know, my friend,
especially when it comes unbidden from our children
despite the flaws they see so vividly in us.
Who can love you as your child does?
Your son so ill, the brutal chemo, his looming loss
owning you now — yet you would be this generous
to think of my child. With the pens you sent
she has made I hope a healing instrument."
175,A Word,Scott Cairns,"For A.B.

She said God. He seems to be there 
when I call on Him but calling
has been difficult too. Painful. 

And as she quieted to find 
another word, I was delivered 
once more to my own long grappling 

with that very angel here — still 
here — at the base of the ancient 
ladder of ascent, in foul dust

languishing yet at the very
bottom rung, letting go my grip 
long before the blessing."
176,Yellow Goblins,Fanny Howe,"Yellow goblins
and a god I can swallow:

Eyes in the evergreens
under ice.

Interior monologue
and some voice.

Weary fears, the
usual trials and

a place to surmise
blessedness."
177,Bride of the New Dawn,Laura Mullen,"She appears to be recognized as herself and not herself, new because endlessly recycled, not what she was but not what she will be—see? Not married and not not married, the processional’s a ritual meant to extend a magical present, until the head of this pin is the size of a rented hall and all of us angels stepping out on the long blank train of her on-going gown. To go in single and come married out is easy enough, what matters is to enlarge the interstitial, to live as long as we can in the not exactly no longer and the not quite not yet also. Where organ music drowns the ill-digested vows and the empty stomach growls. Hesitant. The BND goes down slow as a pill we can’t really swallow, stuck chunk in a stalled gulp between yesterday and tomorrow, at one and the same time belated and punctual. It’s the system itself we’ve come to see (open the plug of that rubber-edged rose window), not me and not you, but we: the marriage of church and state made visible, audible, available. Here 
Dearly Beloved’s
 an embarrassing gurgle, and the costly gown so much densely crumpled bathroom tissue backing up one overworked way in and out of the usual world. From the mouth to points South, scrawl that in soap on the vehicle? From “will you?” to “why don’t you ever?” on the march to “irreconcilable.” Hey—whoa! Away with you hand-wringing nay sayers: be here now now now now…. Cheeks are flushed and eyes overflow as we grasp her new handle, here to hear the I do as a couple of hard blows: that flesh-blunted sound of bone on bone dislodging as cough a caught morsel not thoroughly chewed. Back out, back up, quagmire, circle: proposed solutions involve the usual budget expansions, extended tours of duty, and additional troops."
178,Years,Alicia Ostriker,"—for J.P.O.

I have wished you dead and myself dead,
How could it be otherwise.
I have broken into you like a burglar
And you've set your dogs on me.
You have been a hurricane to me
And a pile of broken sticks
A child could kick.
I have climbed you like a monument, gasping,
For the exercise and the view,
And leaned over the railing at the top–
Strong and warm, that summer wind."
179,In the Planetarium,James Doyle,"I read the palms of the other
kids on the field trip to see
which ones would grow up

to be astronauts. The lifeline
on Betty Lou’s beautiful hand
ended the day after tomorrow,

so I told her how the rest
of our lives is vastly over-rated,
even in neighboring galaxies.

When she asked me how I knew
so much, I said I watched
 War of the Worlds six times

and, if she went with me to
the double-feature tomorrow,
I’d finish explaining the universe.

I smiled winningly. The Halley’s Comet
lecture by our teacher whooshed in
my one ear and out the other."
180,Afterlife,Bruce Snider,"I wake to leafless vines and muddy fields,
patches of standing water. His pocketknife

waits in my dresser drawer, still able to gut fish.
I pick up his green shirt, put it on for the fourth day

in a row. Outside, the rusty nail he hammered
catches me, leaves its stain on everything.

The temperature drops, the whole shore
filling with him: his dented chew can, waders,

the cattails kinked, bowing their distress.
At the pier, I use his old pliers to ready the line:

fatheads, darters, a blood worm jig. Today, the lake’s
one truth is hardness. When the trout bite,

I pull the serviceable things glistening into air."
181,First Night,D. Nurkse,"We brought that newborn home from Maimonides
and showed her nine blue glittering streets.
Would she like the semis with hoods of snow?
The precinct? Bohack’s? A lit diner?
Her eyes were huge and her gaze tilted
like milk in a pan, toward shadow.
Would she like the tenement, three dim flights,
her crib that smelled of Lemon Pledge?
We slept beside her in our long coats,
rigid with fatigue in the unmade bed.
Her breath woke us with its slight catch.
Would she approve of gray winter dawn?
We showed her daylight in our cupped hands.
Then the high clocks began booming
in this city and the next, we counted for her,
but just the strokes, not the laggards
or the tinny echoes, and we taught her
how to wait, how to watch, how to be held,
in that icy room, until our own alarm chimed."
182,Old Men Pitching Horseshoes,X J Kennedy,"Back in a yard where ringers groove a ditch,
These four in shirtsleeves congregate to pitch
Dirt-burnished iron. With appraising eye,
One sizes up a peg, hoists and lets fly—
A clang resounds as though a smith had struck
Fire from a forge. His first blow, out of luck,
Rattles in circles. Hitching up his face,
He swings, and weight once more inhabits space,
Tumbles as gently as a new-laid egg.
Extended iron arms surround their peg
Like one come home to greet a long-lost brother.
Shouts from one outpost. Mutters from the other.

Now changing sides, each withered pitcher moves
As his considered dignity behooves
Down the worn path of earth where August flies
And sheaves of air in warm distortions rise,
To stand ground, fling, kick dust with all the force
Of shoes still hammered to a living horse."
183,Blue,Carl Phillips,"As through marble or the lining of   
certain fish split open and scooped   
clean, this is the blue vein
that rides, where the flesh is even   
whiter than the rest of her, the splayed   
thighs mother forgets, busy struggling   
for command over bones: her own,   
those of the chaise longue, all
equally uncooperative, and there’s   
the wind, too. This is her hair, gone   
from white to blue in the air.

This is the black, shot with blue, of my dark   
daddy’s knuckles, that do not change, ever.   
Which is to say they are no more pale   
in anger than at rest, or when, as
I imagine them now, they follow
the same two fingers he has always used   
to make the rim of every empty blue
glass in the house sing.
Always, the same
blue-to-black sorrow
no black surface can entirely hide.

Under the night, somewhere
between the white that is nothing so much as   
blue, and the black that is, finally; nothing,   
I am the man neither of you remembers.   
Shielding, in the half-dark,
the blue eyes I sometimes forget
I don’t have. Pulling my own stoop-
shouldered kind of blues across paper.   
Apparently misinformed about the rumored   
stuff of dreams: everywhere I inquired,   
I was told look for blue."
184,Desdichada,Muriel Rukeyser,"I.

For that you never acknowledged me, I acknowledge
the spring’s yellow detail, the every drop of rain,
the anonymous unacknowledged men and women.
The shine as it glitters in our child’s wild eyes,
one o’clock at night.       This river, this city,
the years of the shadow on the delicate skin
of my hand, moving in time.
Disinherited, annulled, finally disacknowledged
and all of my own asking.        I keep that wild dimension
of life and making and the spasm
upon my mouth as I say this word of acknowledge
to you forever.        Ewig.        Two o’clock at night.

II.

While this my day and my people are a country not yet born
it has become an earth I can
acknowledge.       I must.        I know what the
disacknowledgment does.        Then I do take you,
but far under consciousness, knowing
that under under flows a river wanting
the other :  to go open-handed in Asia,
to cleanse the tributaries and the air, to make for making,
to stop selling death and its trash, pour plastic down men’s throats,
to let this child find, to let men and women find,
knowing the seeds in us all.        They do say Find.
I cannot acknowledge it entire.        But I will.
A beginning, this moment, perhaps, and you.

III.

Death flowing down past me, past me, death
marvelous, filthy, gold,
in my spine in my sex upon my broken mouth
and the whole beautiful mouth of the child;
shedding power over me
death
if I acknowledge him.
Leading me
in my own body
at last in the dance."
185,Effort at Speech Between Two People,Muriel Rukeyser,":  Speak to me.          Take my hand.            What are you now?
   I will tell you all.          I will conceal nothing.
   When I was three, a little child read a story about a rabbit
   who died, in the story, and I crawled under a chair    :
   a pink rabbit    :    it was my birthday, and a candle
   burnt a sore spot on my finger, and I was told to be happy.

:  Oh, grow to know me.        I am not happy.        I will be open:
   Now I am thinking of white sails against a sky like music,
   like glad horns blowing, and birds tilting, and an arm about me.
   There was one I loved, who wanted to live, sailing.

:  Speak to me.        Take my hand.        What are you now?
   When I was nine, I was fruitily sentimental,
   fluid    :    and my widowed aunt played Chopin,
   and I bent my head on the painted woodwork, and wept.
   I want now to be close to you.        I would
   link the minutes of my days close, somehow, to your days.

:  I am not happy.          I will be open.
   I have liked lamps in evening corners, and quiet poems.
   There has been fear in my life.          Sometimes I speculate
   On what a tragedy his life was, really.

:  Take my hand.          Fist my mind in your hand.          What are you now?
   When I was fourteen, I had dreams of suicide,
   and I stood at a steep window, at sunset, hoping toward death   :
   if the light had not melted clouds and plains to beauty,
   if light had not transformed that day, I would have leapt.
   I am unhappy.          I am lonely.          Speak to me.

:  I will be open.          I think he never loved me:
   He loved the bright beaches, the little lips of foam
   that ride small waves, he loved the veer of gulls:
   he said with a gay mouth: I love you.          Grow to know me.

:  What are you now?          If we could touch one another,
   if these our separate entities could come to grips,
   clenched like a Chinese puzzle . . . yesterday
   I stood in a crowded street that was live with people,
   and no one spoke a word, and the morning shone.
   Everyone silent, moving. . . . Take my hand.          Speak to me."
186,Girl Sleuth,Brenda Hillman,"A brenda is missing—where is she?
Summon the seeds & weeds, the desert whooshes. Phone the finch
with the crowded beak;   a little pretenda
                is learning to read
in the afternoon near the cactus caves. Near oleander & pulpy
caves with the click-click of the wren & the shkrrrr of the thrasher,
               a skinny pretenda is learning
to read till the missing brenda
               is found. Drip of syllables like olives near the saguaro.
Nancy Drew will find the secret in raincoats & wednesdays
              & sticks. Nancy whose spine is yellow
              or blue will find the brenda in 1962,
 Nancy                   who has no mother,
              who takes suggestions from her father & ignores them.
 
Gleam goes the wren ignoring the thorn. They cannot tell the difference.
Click of the smart dog’s nails on linoleum.
                                 Nancy bends over the clues,
of brenda’s locket & dress. Word by word
               between syllables a clue. Where has the summer gone, the autumn—
are they missing too? Maybe Nancy
                will parse the secret & read the book report on Nancy Drew:
“neat pretty sly cute.” Syllable by syllable
                & still no brenda!   Nancy
puts her hand to her forehead; is the missing
girl in the iron bird? is the clue to the girl in the locket?"
187,National Account,Joel Craig,"How do you recognize a lovely place?
The rotten anthropology of superheroes
hovers above the conference table, exhausted
on the idea of dazzling people. A plugged
organization of the moon like a turnpike
undecorated by barely legal children —
true stories end in the moody doctor city
but I always say the wrong thing. Away
from Las Vegas I spend too much time
at the whale facility. I’m bored with awakening
into historical X-rays
of the NO MOMENT. (What showmanship!)
Who does wear a cape underwater?
Now Egypt is miniaturized and it may never rain
again. Hurling bodies and collapsing lungs
used to be honestly scripted activities —
the stillness in the dream of important history.
From now on your stillness will be happening.
In the actual dream remember how the children
were modified, the sputtering, Russel Crotty language?
Friendly Calliope is no longer remedial
in the crisply American landscape. Even snowy
Vermont grows opaque, a diminished suggestion
in the desert mirror. I feel as if I’m speaking to a dear friend
but I’m saying the wrong things. I don’t like cockfights
or you’d rather be my daughter, deeply, authentically
factualizing our especially Southern roots."
188,Pantoum,Randall Mann,"If there is a word in the lexicon of love,
it will not declare itself.
The nature of words is to fail
men who fall in love with men.

It will not declare itself,
the perfect word. Boyfriend seems ridiculous:
men who fall in love with men
deserve something a bit more formal.

The perfect word? Boyfriend? Ridiculous.
But partner is . . . businesslike—
we deserve something a bit less formal,
much more in love with love.

But if partner is businesslike,
then lover suggests only sex,
is too much in love with love.
There is life outside of the bedroom,

and lover suggests only sex.
We are left with roommate, or friend. 
There is life, but outside of the bedroom.
My friend and I rarely speak of one another.

To my left is my roommate, my friend.
If there is a word in the lexicon of love,
my friend and I rarely speak it of one another.
The nature of words is to fail."
189,Partita for Sparrows,Brenda Hillman,"We bury the sparrows of Europe
with found instruments,
their breasts light as an ounce of tea
where we had seen them off the path,
their twin speeds of shyness & notched wings
near the pawnbroker’s house by the canal,
in average neighborhoods of the resisters,
or in markets of princely delphinium & flax,
flying from awnings at unmarked rates
to fetch crumbs from our table half-spinning
back to clefs of grillwork on external stairs
we would descend much later;
 
in rainy neighborhoods of the resisters
where streets were taken one by one,
where consciousness is a stair or path,
we mark their domains with notched sticks
of hickory or chestnut or ash
because our cities of princely pallor
should not have unmarked graves.
Lyric work, flight of arch, death bridge
to which patterned being is parallel:
they came as if from the margins
of a painting, their average hearts half-spinning
our little hourglass up on the screen."
190,Penguin,Joel Craig,"Have you seen, have you seen magic shadows? — Fleetwood Mac, “Nightwatch”

My fugues have no apparent relation to past trauma of any kind.
When it came time to rehearse we decided to get glamorous.
We get all done-up for rehearsal. Gradually, imperceptibly, things begin
slipping back into their normal place. My body is slowly rotating
into its proper north-south orientation. My playing is flawless
as it turns out. The audience goes nuts
but what was it all about?
Had I longer to see the aspects and facets of the family,
which as we know are not always tickety-boo but I have drifted away
like a wide-winged bird over many things that are meaningless,
yet my mind is clicking away quite properly on other levels.
I was never in it for the money, but I see where it goes
without ever touching it.
 
It was like a honeymoon — nothing made sense, sounding utterly
convincing to my own ears — selfness in training, needing a month of good sleep.
When I woke I saw the sunlight streaming in across the ceiling and thought
oh boy, we were awful yesterday, the obvious response being
to phone the boss and tell him you’re sick and go to bed until it’s passed,
except Boss is in bed too.
Don’t let the lack of his spirit blind your life.
You would expect me to tell you, wouldn’t you, if our positions were reversed,
while I look for a suitable shirt, but you
don’t have any more to accomplish, nothing at all.
Did you ever love me? Could I grit my teeth
and carry it all off without anyone being the wiser?
 
Any words that have concrete meanings are fine
and completely friendly. The whole history of the human race
is somewhat sad, wouldn’t you say, if you look at it
in a certain way? But then, if you squint a bit differently
it isn’t sad at all.
 
There were times we were all hurting really bad,
thinking the bed will win. Maybe it was the beginnings of trademark —
if we stayed telepathic we couldn’t do that — surprise, surprise,
and that’s how we decided to do the dance
and that’s how The Dance came about.
There was a large, grassy clearing in the forest,
the trees around it thick and tall and there was sunlight
on the grass. We knew that people were worshipping
and the way they did it was to gather around a place like this
and allow themselves to become a part of it, greeting it
and letting it greet them feeding their bodies to their souls,
the pity of the tribe was how we imagined it,
seeing behind closed eyelids a lovely scene,
looking down from an open balcony into a central courtyard.
We were in a place that appeared to consist of baskets of flowers.
 
I could see only the top of his brown hair and his moving hands.
There’s a lot of color. It’s more noticeable than usual — I mean
there are little prisms, rainbows everywhere
but whether it was guitar or piano I couldn’t tell you — this is
pre-Lindsey. The back room was vicious, everyone on a different drug.
If you turned your back you’d better keep on walking.
We did this every night, playing country rock at the height of glitter,
mixed-bag material. We needed theoretical problems!
My back to him, I said, “You mean us poor, sad little cast-offs,
wouldn’t it be nice if we could cheer each other up
so our miser wouldn’t cast a pall
on the happiness of the Prince and Princess?”
Only I’m foreshadowing with picky surfaces.
The morals are contemporary — argument
of sounds, accomodation, implosion, but still
the ineffable grace of seeming perishable —
the ordinariness of making love and hearing music.
 
I’m okay by myself, believe me.
It’s a thought that gives rise to immense self-compassion. Okay,
I’ll deal with this.
I kind of went on the skids.
It was just the four of us finally starting to crank it out, faster
and faster, until it was too fast.
Then one day, it was a Friday, always payday and I was in the bedroom
beginning to sort out what I thought of as my shitpile,
a collection of such things as dresses, belts, stockings, photographs,
and old magazines all waiting to be put where they belong."
191,The Speed of Darkness,Muriel Rukeyser,"I

Whoever despises the clitoris despises the penis
Whoever despises the penis despises the cunt
Whoever despises the cunt despises the life of the child.

No longer speaking
Listening with the whole body

Overtaken by silence

After the lifting of the mist
after the lift of the heavy rains
the sky stands clear
and the cries of the city risen in day
I remember the buildings are space
walled, to let space be used for living
I mind this room is space
this drinking glass is space
whose boundary of glass
lets me give you drink and space to drink
your hand, my hand being space
containing skies and constellations
your face
carries the reaches of air
I know I am space
my words are air.

192,The White House,Joel Craig,"He knows how to do what he sets out to do
                                                       with perfectly obvious procedure. The sea
                                                       is dark and forbidding. The horizon
                                                       is dark and forbidding.
 
Even from a distance, the less said the better. The colors in some of these landscapes
                                                       are perfectly desperate.
 
In a portrait there is never anything wrong
                                                      with the mouth. There is never anything wrong
                                                      with anything. Machines are not choosers.
                                                      The next best things are certain. Heaven
                                                      knowing the next best things. The young
                                                      can explain it, but who would they explain
                                                      it to? More promise than performance
                                                      as all sorts of things begin to interfere.
 
An energetic hostess seated me at the counter
                                                      next to a beautiful woman. It is possible
                                                      the timid portion of the population
                                                      unless held firmly in check will imitate
                                                      the silliness of timid people of years ago.
 
Supplication is valued. As soon as I learned the facts I gave up
                                                      on the exchange. She wanted something
                                                      mysterious, as if everything were the same.
 
Life changes and so-called truth changes with it. The businesslike
                                                      haste of the surgeon as he scolds the public.
                                                      To look at him and the thing he can never look at
                                                      shudderingly as the blood is drawn
                                                      is the duty of every patriot.
 
In a constructive age such as this I should have neglected everything
                                                      for the supreme duty of aiding
                                                      in the reconstruction.
 
I took my courage, which starts everywhere and goes
                                                      nowhere, and spoke to her. Here
                                                      one can unquestionably infer the inside
                                                      from the outside.
 
The leaders of the free world, assembled as if by magic,
                                                      seem to have the enemy at their mercy.
                                                      It can be argued that Christ himself spoke
                                                      to the mob. The crowd will stop
                                                      to see almost anything. The crowd will stop
                                                      to see something about almost everything."
193,[Coda de l'itinérant figé / Coda of the Fixed Itinerant],Geoffrey Brock,"Always the evening noises, the footsteps on the stairs, the day that rises in the throat. 
       A turn of the key will expel the world. 
       Against the extinct forest of furniture, the channeled bloodstream translates the dream into this small life. 

       In the end we shrink until finally we can no longer inhabit the gestures of our childhood. 

       A nail in a board: the remains of a fence; blurred memory of the mountain that raised the tree, that brooded over its ore. 

       Modest against a hedge, a spade dreams its beautiful death. 
       “Simple and calm,” nourished on weeds and wind, the image moves, distilling its own memory. Far off, we disappear into the ochre and the gold, the mud-brown and the primordial green.

       The slightest evidence of life. In the courtyard's silence, the barking of that dog. A shutter, merely, that's banging. Those books stacked in one corner of the room. Everything that, ordinarily, follows its automated course. And there, all at once: the happiness that spreads its billion pinpricks through the body.

        Evening's voice unreels its argument. Five floors below, the courtyard and its echoes. The barking still, and overhead the footsteps of regret in the maids' rooms. I'll try to have given each thing my word before giving in to sleep. 

       The room breathes deeply the music of a quartet. It's that grave well-being, unexpectedly, you know? 
       Nobody. You may speak. I'm not there. 

       A gesture: the garden diffuses the pale green taste of currants. One remains quiet as long as possible.
       Another gesture: the sun rips open the scent of the lindens. Childhood leaps over the wall. 
       The miracle would be having something to say. 

       Maybe we could have inhabited that smile, over there, at the other end of the room; or else we could have met at the improbable dawn of memory. Maybe we could have fallen asleep in the twilight of this autumn when the brain is nothing more than oak and leather.
       But we have only this thin life to place beneath the axe. 

       The crows in the plowed field, black against the field's ochre, gleaming and black amid the smell of moist earth, a smell mixed with the brush and bark and roots that the wind returns as someone somewhere burns them. 
       And then that pile of words that rots with helplessness.

       In the forest, the sound, dry and brief, of a pebble in a streambed, fallen after patient millennia into the earth's darkness. Just a dry sound and its echo, quickly engulfed by birdcalls. And later, on the path, drops of blood from the trees. 

       A farmer carriers his tools slowly toward the shed. In the atmospheric silence, a woodpecker registers the sound of its life's work. That's all. Some animals, a pile of wood, and the smell of rain, which always calls to mind something that can't quite be reconstructed. 

       Acrid smoke; and then that crackling of the woods in the clearing. A few centimeters above the cut weeds, the tenuous vapor of memory. 
       Between eyelashes, amid the colors of the woods, the colors of weeds, and earth, that sky, that patch of sky, that sky. 

       The courtyard, the wood bench, the sputtering of the fishpond, the smell of humus, the smell of mushroom. 
       Five notes in the rain sketch the presence of a bird. 

       The village, the morning, belong to the birds. Images flow freely through the alleys. Silence full of events: the eyes prey on a shadow. A gull's passing reshapes all the shores of the world. 

       Birdcalls cut through the fog, wet grass: morning. The rectangle of a wall says: “blank,” nothing else. On the horizon, very nearby, a woman dressed in black glides silently across her wide open destiny. 

       Between branches, near the sun, the moon, which opens the night to the night. I sink, gently, and disappear. On the surface, alone, the cry of an owl keeps watch. 

       The stairs, the brass doorknob, the smell of dark corners. The iron bed, the red bedspread. Slow breathing. That song that waits for nothing but our melody. 

       We are of the morning, of the gently sloping hour that comes slowly down from the sun. The old clothes in the corner are tinged with the morning's color, which will have to be worn. The lark's song widens the silence. 

       Deep in the forest, the cuckoo, the woodpecker, the chiaroscuro of ancient musics. Heavy wagons clench their signal-lights toward the heights of the opaque sky. I moved with closed words across the homeland that sleeps me. 

       From this far country, where you respond to me without my hearing a word of yours, without perhaps my words ever reaching you, from this country where perhaps we understand each other, I overhear the most contradictory noises, which veil and deny your voice, and which would like to make me believe that I'm speaking alone."
194,Franciscan Complex,Brenda Hillman,"Each day the job gets up
And rubs its eyes
 
We are going to live on in dry amazement
 
Workers push the granite bed under the avenue
 
Bed of the married
The re-          the pre-married
 
Making a form as forms become infinite
 
The scrapings       scraping
 
Graywhacke    chert
 
People wait for their bumpy little pizzas
Theories of theories in gravity voices
 
Melpomene goddess of tragedy bathes
 
Mostly the bride never the bridesmaid
 
Angel food in whole foods
 
Consider Tanguy whose lunar responses to childhood
Made everything a horizon
 
Those walking upside down don’t know what to think
 
The finch engineering itself to deep spring

How many layers
Of giving up are there

Two of everything in the arc you save"
195,Glacial Erratics,Brenda Hillman,"The last ice age had been caused by a wobble.
After it passed they made houses from stars;
 
Visitors would peer in
And see the tongs not slipping,
 
Roomsized pebbles having been moved far.
 
It’s like this more
When we speak than when we write;
 
Loving thus we have been
Loved by ground,
 
The word being
A box with four of its corners hidden;
 
Everything else is round."
196,In Ecstasy,Erin Belieu,"at the altarpiece of Saint Teresa
 
 

No need to be coy—
you know what
she’s doing
 
And so did Bernini,
when he found Teresa
in the full-throttle of
her divine vision,
            caught her at it,
 
carving this surrender
so fluidly you expect
the impossible:
 
for her tang to swell up, ripe
as seafoam, from the gulf
of her flushed and falling
figure. Perhaps this is how
 
God comes to us,
or should come to us, all:
 
the bluntly and
beautifully corporeal at
 
prayers in the Sunday
school of pleasure. Why
 
shouldn’t He come to us
as He did to Teresa? A saint
 
on her back—
a girl tearing open
the gift He gave her?"

FOR  ELIZABETH   ROBINSON"
199,Of the Poet’s Youth,Erin Belieu,"When the man behind the counter said, “You pay
by the orifice,” what could we do but purchase them all?
 
Ah, Sandy, you were clearly the deluxe doll, modish and pert
in your plastic nurse whites, official hostess to our halcyon days,
 
where you bobbed in the doorway of our dishabille apartment,
a block downwind from the stockyards. Holding court on
 
the corroded balcony, K. and I passed hash brownies, collecting
change for the building’s monthly pool to predict which balcony
 
would fall off next. That’s when K. was fucking M. and M. was
fucking J., and even B. and I threw down once on the glass-speckled
 
lawn, adrift in the headlights of his El Camino. Those were immortal
times, Sandy! Coke wasn’t addictive yet, condoms prevented herpes
 
and men were only a form of practice for the Russian novel
we foolishly hoped our lives would become. Now it’s a Friday night,
 
sixteen years from there. Don’t the best characters know better
than to live too long? My estranged husband house-sits for a spoiled
 
cockatoo while saving to buy his own place. My lover’s gone back
to his gin and the farm-team fiancée he keeps in New York.
 
What else to do but read Frank O’Hara to my tired three-year-old?
When I put him to bed, he mutters “more sorry” as he turns into sleep.
 
Tonight, I find you in a box I once marked “The Past.” Well,
therapy’s good for some things, Sandy, but who’d want to forgive
 
a girl like that? Frank says Destroy yourself if you don’t know!
Deflated, you’re simply the smile that surrounds a hole.
                                                                                     I don’t know anything."
200,Violent Rooms,Dawn Lundy Martin,"1.   
The contours of the girl blur. She is both becoming and fact.
A rancor defines the split. Rip into. Flatten the depth of voice. That
 
urgent flex peels off the steady layers. A girl, I say.
Girl. Gu-erl. Quell. He. He—unbuttons before emergence.
 
As in yard rake pressed to roof of mouth. A fragrant rod.
 Suh—sssuh—ssuck. Insistence. Lips go lisp. Our brutish boy.
 
Having not ever been whole. Or simple. Or young. Just split and open.
Not of it. For it. Born a cog of hard wheel at five, six, seven . . .
 
What to know of what has never been?
 
 
 2.  

No common place would do: bar stool, front porch, sea rock.
Such a room should crawl into the soul. Stretch it. Contort it.
 
Could be the straddle of this stranger at the neck. I am this. 
She does not waver. She is twenty-five. The bed is wet. As many
 
as had done this thing before. The wound is rupture. Blood-faced.
Between sailing and anchor. No, between shipwreck and burial.
 
What does the mouth do? It does not mean no, saying no.
It does not mean yes. It gurgles. It swells. It is comfort.
 
A quick kick. Mighty, mighty."
201,I Heart Your Dog’s Head,Erin Belieu,"I’m watching football, which is odd as
I hate football
in a hyperbolic and clinically revealing way,
but I hate Bill Parcells more,
because he is the illuminated manuscript
of cruel, successful men, those with the slitty eyes of ancient reptiles,
who wear their smugness like a tight white turtleneck,
and revel in their lack of empathy
for any living thing.
So I’m watching football, staying up late to watch football,
hoping to witness (as I think of it)
The Humiliation of the Tuna
(as he is called),
which is rightly Parcells’s first time back in the Meadowlands
since taking up with the Cowboys,
who are, as we all know,
thugs, even by the NFL’s standards. The reasons

I hate football are clear and complicated and were born,
as I was, in Nebraska,
where football is to life what sleep deprivation is
to Amnesty International, that is,
the best researched and most effective method
of breaking a soul. Yes,
there’s the glorification of violence, the weird nexus
knitting the homo, both phobic and erotic,
but also, and worse, my parents in 1971, drunk as
Australian parrots in a bottlebush, screeching
WE’RE #1, WE’RE #1!
when the Huskers finally clinched the Orange Bowl,
the two of them
bouncing up and down crazily on the couch, their index
fingers jutting holes through the ubiquitous trail of smoke rings
that was the weather in our house,
until the whole deranged mess that was them,
my parents, the couch, their lit cigarettes,
flipped over backward onto my brother and me. My husband
thinks that’s a funny story and, in an effort to be a “good sport,”
I say I think it is, too.
 
Which leads me to recall the three Chihuahuas
who’ve spent the fullness of their agitated lives penned
in the back of my neighbor’s yard.
Today they barked continuously for 12 minutes (I timed it) as
the UPS guy made his daily round.
They bark so piercingly, they tremble with such exquisite outrage,
that I’ve begun to root for them, though it’s fashionable
to hate them and increasingly dark threats
against their tiny persons move between the houses on our block.
But isn’t that what’s wrong with this version of America:
the jittering, small-skulled, inbred-by-no-choice-
of-their-own are despised? And Bill Parcells—
the truth is he’ll win
this game. I know it and you know it and, sadly,
did it ever seem there was another possible outcome?
 
It’s a small deposit,
but I’m putting my faith in reincarnation. I need to believe
in the sweetness of one righteous image,
in Bill Parcells trapped in the body of a teacup poodle,
as any despised thing,
forced to yap away his next life staked to
a clothesline pole or doing hard time on a rich old matron’s lap,
dyed lilac to match her outfit.
I want to live there someday, across that street,
and listen to him. Yap, yap, yap."
202,Happiness,Paisley Rekdal,"I have been taught never to brag but now
I cannot help it: I keep
a beautiful garden, all abundance,
indiscriminate, pulling itself
from the stubborn earth: does it offend you
to watch me working in it,
touching my hands to the greening tips or
tearing the yellow stalks back, so wild
the living and the dead both
snap off in my hands?
The neighbor with his stuttering
fingers, the neighbor with his broken
love: each comes up my drive
to receive his pitying,
accustomed consolations, watches me
work in silence awhile, rises in anger,
walks back. Does it offend them to watch me
not mourning with them but working
fitfully, fruitlessly, working
the way the bees work, which is to say
by instinct alone, which looks like pleasure?
I can stand for hours among the sweet
narcissus, silent as a point of bone.
I can wait longer than sadness. I can wait longer
than your grief. It is such a small thing
to be proud of, a garden. Today
there were scrub jays, quail,
a woodpecker knocking at the white-
and-black shapes of trees, and someone’s lost rabbit
scratching under the barberry: is it
indiscriminate? Should it shrink back, wither,
and expurgate? Should I, too, not be loved?
It is only a little time, a little space.
Why not watch the grasses take up their colors in a rush
like a stream of kerosene being lit?
If I could not have made this garden beautiful
I wouldn’t understand your suffering,
nor care for each the same, inflamed way.
I would have to stay only like the bees,
beyond consciousness, beyond
self-reproach, fingers dug down hard
into stone, and growing nothing.
There is no end to ego,
with its museum of disappointments.
I want to take my neighbors into the garden
and show them: Here is consolation.
Here is your pity. Look how much seed it drops
around the sparrows as they fight.
It lives alongside their misery.
It glows each evening with a violent light."
203,[When the bed is empty ... ],Dawn Lundy Martin,"When the bed is empty, we pull the shades to block light,
light of resemblance to remembery, long light of waiting,
an impatience in the glows of it. The here of the now and the glow
that days make in the room, without the body but with the stench
of it. So we say, vacancy and abject,against the was, against
a philosophy of once and then not. Not-being against.
A child once grew here. As lines on a wall. As
growing without knowing what would one day not be. A
gnawing grows. Grew and was. Protection is curled. Motion-
less. I envy her in her room. Hers with paint and dolls and hand-
prints. Great green and glowing under blankets with a hand
that nurtures the heart of the mouth, purrs into mouth, loves
the heart. Heart beating within another—blushing blood—
God, the beating, lit, and doing what it does."
204,Why Some Girls Love Horses,Paisley Rekdal,"And then I thought, Can I have more
of this, would it be possible
for every day to be a greater awakening: more light,
more light, your face on the pillow
with the sleep creases rudely
fragmenting it, hair so stiff
from paint and sheet rock it feels
like the dirty short hank
of mane I used to grab on Dandy’s neck
before he hauled me up and forward,
white flanks flecked green
with shit and the satin of his dander,
the livingness, the warmth
of all that blood just under the skin
and in the long, thick muscle of the neck—
He was smarter than most of the children
I went to school with. He knew
how to stand with just the crescent
of his hoof along a boot toe and press,
incrementally, his whole weight down. The pain
so surprising when it came,
its iron intention sheathed in stealth, the decisive
sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof
pinned one’s foot completely to the ground,
we’d have to beat and beat him with a brush
to push him off, that hot
insistence with its large horse eye trained
deliberately on us, to watch—

Like us, he knew how to announce through violence
how he didn’t hunger, didn’t want
despite our practiced ministrations: too young
not to try to empathize
with this cunning: this thing
that was and was not human we must respect
for itself and not our imagination of it: I loved him because
I could not love him anymore
in the ways I’d taught myself,
watching the slim bodies of teenagers
guide their geldings in figure eights around the ring
as if they were one body, one fluid motion
of electric understanding I would never feel
working its way through fingers to the bit: this thing
had a name, a need, a personality; it possessed
an indifference that gave me
logic and a measure: I too might stop wanting
the hand placed on back or shoulder
and never feel the desired response.
I loved the horse for the pain it could imagine

and inflict on me, the sudden jerking
of head away from halter, the tentative nose
inspecting first before it might decide
to relent and eat. I loved
what was not slave or instinct, that when you turn to me
it is a choice, it is always a choice to imagine pleasure
might be blended, one warmth
bleeding into another as the future
bleeds into the past, more light, more light,
your hand against my shoulder, the image
of the one who taught me disobedience
is the first right of being alive."
205,Basal Cell,George Bilgere,"The sun is still burning in my skin
even though it set half-an-hour ago,
and Cindy and Bob and Bev and John
are pulling on their sweatshirts
and gathering around the fire pit.

John hands me a cold one
and now Bev comes into my arms
and I can feel the sun’s heat,
and taste the Pacific on her cheek.

I am not in Vietnam,
nor is John or Bob, because
our deferments came through,
and we get to remain boys
for at least another summer
like this one in Santa Cruz,
surfing the afternoons in a sweet
blue dream I’m remembering now,

as the nurse puts my cheek to sleep,
and the doctor begins to burn
those summers away."
206,Little Girl,Tami Haaland,"She’s with Grandma in front
of Grandma’s house, backed
by a willow tree, gladiola and roses.

Who did she ever want
to please? But Grandma
seems half-pleased and annoyed.

No doubt Mother frowns
behind the lens, wants
to straighten this sassy face.

Maybe laughs, too.
Little girl with her mouth wide,
tongue out, yelling

at the camera. See her little
white purse full of treasure,
her white sandals?

She has things to do,
you can tell. Places to explore
beyond the frame,

and these women picking flowers
and taking pictures.
Why won’t they let her go?"
207,Time,Robin Chapman,"My neighbor, 87, rings the doorbell to ask
 if I might have seen her clipping shears
 that went missing a decade ago,
 with a little red paint on their shaft,
 or the iron turkey bank and the porcelain
 coffee cup that disappeared a while back
 when her friend, now dead, called the police
 to break in to see if she were ill, and have we
 had trouble with our phone line, hers
 is dead and her car and driver’s license
 are missing though she can drive perfectly
 well, just memory problems, and her son
 is coming this morning to take her up
 to Sheboygan, where she was born
 and where the family has its burial lots,
 to wait on assisted living space, and she
 just wanted to say we’d been good neighbors
 all these how many? years, and how lucky
 I am to have found such a nice man
 and could she borrow a screwdriver,
 the door lock to her house is jammed."
208,Evening Conversation,Allan Johnston,"For Robert Penn Warren

Reckless and white as a flashlight beam cast
into some dark corner, the moon
insists on the deeper blackness

surrounding it. Perhaps it wishes
to be a woman or a window, 
cushioning everything, full of itself

for the moment, yet frightened, like any egotist.
But still the stars patiently insist
on their presence, pinholes to nothingness. 

When else would I walk on such a night in the world? 

Half answers suggest themselves. 
The body consumes and wanes, collapses. 
We get to watch how everyone
dies who dies before us,
how birds rest. 

And yet while night solidifies, 
we can continue our discussion
in our effort to open the gift of the world, 
our hope to find years
in this box we tear apart. 

Birds do not count in our calibration. 
They crack time randomly, as if it were seeds. 
With sudden unaccountability
they start up and disappear. 

And yet, in some way all of this
is beside the point, for what can we do
except continue our conversation, 
and what would we gain if we disappeared? 

They tell us that this is so. 

Do you have any songs from your childhood
you still use to sing yourself to sleep? 

Being, mind, ego: the moon loves itself
in cloud shimmers, dancing as if it had pulled
a scant nightie off a laundry line
to clown with. 

We can only walk while there is light."
209,About My Birthday,Marie Ponsot,"I’d like to assume
 from my April birthday,
 I quickened the womb
 on the 4th of July.

 If you suffered as I
 a sternly fought tendency
 to endless dependency
 you’d know why."
210,Album,Kay Ryan,"Death has a life
of  its own. See
how its album
has grown in
a year and how
the sharp blot of it
has softened 
till those could
almost be shadows
behind the
cherry blossoms
in this shot.
In fact you
couldn’t prove
they’re not."
211,Among Women,Marie Ponsot,"What women wander?
 Not many. All. A few.
 Most would, now & then,
 & no wonder.
 Some, and I’m one,
 Wander sitting still.
 My small grandmother
 Bought from every peddler 
 Less for the ribbons and lace
 Than for their scent
 Of sleep where you will, 
 Walk out when you want, choose
 Your bread and your company. 

 She warned me, “Have nothing to lose.”

 She looked fragile but had
 High blood, runner’s ankles,
 Could endure, endure.
 She loved her rooted garden, her
 Grand children, her once
 Wild once young man.
 Women wander
 As best they can."
212,An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,Simon Armitage,"Compiling this landmark anthology of poetry in English
 about dogs and musical instruments is like swimming through bricks. 
 To date, I have only, “On the Death of Mrs. McTuesday’s Pug,
 Killed by a Falling Piano,” a somewhat obvious choice. 
 True, an Aeolian harp whispers alluringly 
 in the background of the anonymous sonnet, “The Huntsman’s
       Hound,” 
 but beyond that — silence. 

 I should resist this degrading donkey-work in favor of my own
       writing, 
 wherein contentment surely lies. 
 But A. Smith stares smugly from the reverse of the twenty pound
       note, 
 and when my bank manager guffaws, 
 small particles of saliva stream like a meteor shower 
 through the infinity of dark space 
between his world and mine."
213,Artifice,Peter Spagnuolo,"The plastic Great Horned Owl, stuck with glue
on the stamped tin, corbelled cornice lip
impresses no one — not the starlings that dip
and stitch, nor pigeons as they fluff and coo
around its feet. And vinyl siding’s too
regular — each molded, faux-grained strip
identical, but for dents, and that drip
of   bird shit from a sill. What if all you
might say speaks like crafted, ersatz things:
mimicry in a tongue you barely know?
Your owl signs death, the cornice stone, the fake
clapboard conjures farmhouse. While just below
the ledge, a wren’s mindless gestures make
an altar of twigs, in veneration of wings."
214,Avalon,Simon Armitage,"To the Metropolitan Police Force, London:
the asylum gates are locked and chained, but undone
by wandering thoughts and the close study of maps.
So from San Francisco, patron city of tramps,
I scribble this note, having overshot Gloucester
by several million strides, having walked on water.

City of sad foghorns and clapboard ziggurats,
of snakes-and-ladders streets and cadged cigarettes,
city of pelicans, fish bones and flaking paint,
of underfoot cable-car wires strained to breaking point    ...
I eat little — a beard of grass, a pinch of oats — 
let the salt-tide scour and purge me inside and out,
but my mind still phosphoresces with lightning strikes
and I straddle each earthquake, one foot either side
of the fault line, rocking the world’s seesaw.
At dusk, the Golden Gate Bridge is heaven’s seashore:
I watch boats heading home with the day’s catch 
or ferrying souls to glittering Alcatraz,
or I face west and let the Pacific slip
in bloodshot glory over the planet’s lip,
sense the waterfall at the end of the journey.

I am, ever your countryman, Ivor Gurney."
215,Bye-bye,Derek Sheffield,"The animal of winter is dying, 
its white body everywhere 
in collapse and stabbed at
by straws of   light, a leaving 
to believe in as the air 
slowly fills with darkness 
and water drains from the tub 
where my daughter, watching it 
lower around her, feeling it 
go, says about the only thing 
she can as if it were a long-
kept breath going with her 
blessing of dribble and fleck.
Down it swirls a living drill
vanishing toward a land
where tomorrow already 
fixes its bright eye on a man
muttering his way into a crowd,
saying about the only thing
he can before his body
goes boom. And tomorrow, 
I will count more dark shapes 
tumbling from the sky, birds 
returning to scarcity, offering 
in their seesawing songs 
a kind of   liquidity."
216,The Day,Geoffrey Brock,"It hangs on its
                stem like a plum
at the edge of a
               darkening thicket.

It’s swelling and
               blushing and ripe
and I reach out a
               hand to pick it

but flesh moves
               slow through time
and evening
               comes on fast

and just when I
               think my fingers
might seize that
               sweetness at last

the gentlest of
               breezes rises
and the plum lets
               go of   the stem.

And now it’s my
               fingers ripening
and evening that’s
               reaching for them."
217,"From ""The First, at the Last""",Marie Ponsot,"All he undertook
goes under, under
the undergrowth he rose from
fly-boy, lovely
in his day. 
All his clothes
— spruce suit & tie —
are underclothes
against ungrounded gray.
All his studies understudy
an unstudied play.
  
           Under the under
          of what I remember
          we are both twenty
          and except with each other
          underemployed.

                 It is summer.
                Under our butter, bread,
                summer’s hunger satisfied."
218,From “The Invention of Influence”,Peter Cole,"Freud could never be certain, he said,
in view of   his wide and early reading,
whether what seemed like a new creation
might not be the work instead
of   hidden channels of memory leading
back to the notions of others absorbed, 
coming now anew into form
he’d almost known within him was growing. 
He called it (the ghost of a) cryptomnesia. 
So we own and owe what we know."
219,The Fury That Breaks,Michelle Boisseau,"After César Vallejo

The fury that breaks a grown-up into kids,
a kid into scattered birds
and a bird into limp eggs,
the fury of the poor
takes one part oil to two parts vinegar.

The fury that breaks a tree into leaves,
a leaf into deranged flowers
and a flower into wilting telescopes,
the fury of the poor
gushes two rivers against a hundred seas.

The fury that breaks the true into doubts,
doubt into three matching arches
and the arch into instant tombs,
the fury of the poor
draws a sharpening stone against two knives.

The fury that breaks the soul into bodies,
the body into warped organs,
and the organ into eight doctrines,
the fury of the poor
burns with one fire in two thousand craters."
220,Hall of Records,Peter Spagnuolo,"There’s a clever thing, stabs at her hand
on every corner now, revising the screed. 
Watch her huff at the tiny screens that send
her chimpish copy up the line, to speed
the raising of the giddy, pixelled hall: 
cornerless, mirror-tiled, the gorging sphere
a fast-receding shell enclosing all
we say or see, never to disappear,
bigger with each second, and the next,
its facets auto-replicant, until
the Record of  what was — each fingered text
and pic, the starry shards the hours distill —
impounds what is, slaves us in its spell,
sorting the diamonds in our dazzling cell."
221,In a Hotel,David Caplan,"In a hotel, even prayer feels adulterous,
the skyline smudged in light, a distraction 
just before dusk. In the lobby

a woman tells a stranger what she will do
for three hundred dollars, what
she will do for four. Some have the custom 

of opening a book randomly with a question in mind. 
Some have the custom of  forgetting. 
At six my friend beat his father at chess, 

beat his father’s friends so easily 
he wondered if  they tried.
At seven he shook the governor’s hand.

Don’t call it a failure; call it knowledge:
the peculiar taste that filled his mouth 
as if   he had bitten his cheek.

Whatever he risked did not matter, whatever 
he could imagine was already lost. 
Bored, the other boy coughed into his hands."
222,Northampton Style,Marie Ponsot,"Evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimer
Northampton-style, on the porch out back.
Its voice touches and parts the air of summer,

as if  it swam to time us down a river
where we dive and leave a single track
as evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimer

that lets us wash our mix of dreams together.
Delicate, tacit, we engage in our act;
its voice touches and parts the air of summer.

When we disentangle you are not with her
I am not with him. Redress calls for tact.
Evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimer

still. A small breeze rises and the leaves stir
as uneasy as we, while the woods go black;
its voice touches and parts the air of summer

and lets darkness enter us; our strings go slack
though the player keeps up his plangent attack.
Evening falls. Someone’s playing a dulcimer;
its voice touches and parts the air of summer."
223,Old Mama Saturday,Marie Ponsot,"“Saturday’s child must work for a living.”

“I’m moving from Grief  Street.
Taxes are high here
though the mortgage’s cheap.

The house is well built.
With stuff to protect, that
mattered to me,
the security.

These things that I mind,
you know, aren’t mine.
I mind minding them.
They weigh on my mind.

I don’t mind them well.
I haven’t got the knack
of  kindly minding.
I say Take them back
but you never do.

When I throw them out
it may frighten you
and maybe me too.

                 Maybe
it will empty me
too emptily

and keep me here
asleep, at sea
under the guilt quilt,
under the you tree.”"
224,On Gardens,Rick Barot,"When I read about the garden
designed to bloom only white flowers,
I think about the Spanish friar who saw one
of my grandmothers, two hundred years 
removed, and fucked her. If you look 
at the word colony far enough, you see it
traveling back to the Latin
of  inhabit, till, and cultivate. Words 

that would have meant something
to the friar, walking among the village girls
as though in a field of flowers, knowing
that fucking was one way of   having
a foreign policy. As I write this, there’s snow
falling, which means that every
angry thought is as short-lived as a match.
The night is its own white garden:

snow on the fence, snow on the tree
stump, snow on the azalea bushes,
their leaves hanging down like green
bats from the branches. I know it’s not fair
to see qualities of injustice in the aesthetics
of a garden, but somewhere between
what the eye sees and what the mind thinks 
is the world, landscapes mangled

into sentences, one color read into rage.
When the neighbors complained
the roots of our cypress were buckling
their lot, my landlord cut the tree down.
I didn’t know a living thing three stories high
could be so silent, until it was gone.
Suddenly that sky. Suddenly all the light
in the windows, as though every sheet

of glass was having a migraine.
When I think about that grandmother 
whose name I don’t even know, I think of
what it would mean to make a garden
that blooms black: peonies and gladiolas
of deepest purple, tulips like ravens.
Or a garden that doesn’t bloom at all: rocks
poised on clean gravel. When the snow stops,

I walk to see the quiet that has colonized
everything. The main street is asleep, except
for the bus that goes by, bright as a cruise ship. 
There are sheet cakes of  snow on top
of cars. In front of   houses, each lawn
is as clean as paper, except where the first cat
or raccoon has walked across, each track
like a barbed-wire sash on a white gown."
225,Out of Water,Marie Ponsot,"A new embroidery of flowers, canary color,
                        dots the grass already dotty
                        with aster-white and clover.

I warn, “They won’t last, out of water.”
The children pick some anyway.

In or out of  water
children don’t last either.

I watch them as they pick.
Still free of  what’s next
            and what was yesterday
they pick today."
226,Party Ship,Kay Ryan,"You are a
land I can’t 
stand leaving
and can’t not.
My party ship
is pulling out.
We all have
hats. I try to
toot some notes
you’ll understand
but this was not
our instrument
or plan."
227,Pathetic Fallacies Are Bad Science But,Marie Ponsot,"On reading Susanne K. Langer’s Mind

If  leaf-trash chokes the stream-bed,
reach for rock-bottom as you rake
the muck out. Let it slump dank,

Stand back. Watch the water vault ahead.
Its thrust sweeps the surface clean, shores the debris,
as it debrides its stone path to the lake,
clarity carrying clarity.

To see clear, resist the drag of  images.
Take nature as it is, not Dame nor Kind.
Act in events; touch what you name. Abhor
easy obverts of natural metaphor.
Let human speech breathe out its best poor bridges
from mind to world, mind to self, mind to mind.

Yet, I admit the event of the wood thrush:
     In a footnote Langer (her book rapids-clean
     like the spring-water aired over sleeked rock)
     says she witnessed an August bird in shock
     when a hawk snatched its mate. It perched, rushed
     notes fluting two life-quotas in one flood,
     its lungs pushing its voice, flushing the keen
     calls, pumped out as the heart pumps blood,
     not in twilight or warning but noon & wrong,
     its old notes whistled too fast but accurate.

I read this drenched in bird-panic, its spine-
fusing loss all song, all loss; that loss mine
awash in unanswered unanswered song.
And I cannot claim we are not desolate."

Never prophesy.
You can’t. So don’t try.
Lust, pride, and lethargy
may cause us misery
or bliss.
The meanest mistake
has a point to make.
Hear this — 
what his vintner d’Eyquem said
once the lord d’Eyquem was dead:
         “The wine that year promised bad or none.
          He’d let it go too late.
          Rot had crawled through all the vines,
          greasy scum on every cluster
          dangling at the crotches of the leaves.
          Should have been long picked
          but he’d said, ‘No. Wait for me,’
          off to wait on a new woman,
          grapes on the verge of ripe
          when he left. Coupling kept him
          till rot wrapped the grapes like lace
          & by the time she’d kicked him out
          the sun had got them, they hung
          shriveled in the blast.

          Well, he rode home cocky
          & bullied the grapes into the vats
          rot & all, spoiled grapes, too old,
          too soon squeezed dry.
                                                     The wine makes.
          The wine makes thick, gold-colored,
          & pours like honey.
          We try it. Fantastic!

         not like honey, punchy,
         you’ve never drunk anything like it — 
         refreshing, in a rush
         over a heat that slows your throat —
         wanting to keep that flavor
         stuck to the edge of your tongue
         where your taste is, keep it
         like the best bouquet you can remember
         of sundown summer & someone coming
         to you smiling. The taste has odor
         like a new country, so fine
         at first you can’t take it in
         it’s so strange. It’s beautiful
         & believe me you love to go slow.”

But why are you here

when you could be elsewhere,

Why should we care

why you’re here?

Is that a tear?
Yes, there’s pressure 
behind the eyes —
and there are peers.

But why are you here?

At times it sears.
The pressure and shame
and the echoing pain.
What do you hear

now that you’re here?

The air’s so severe.
It calls for equipment,
which comes at a price.
And you’ve volunteered.

Why? Are you here?

What will you wear?
What will you do
if it turns out you’ve failed?
How will you fare?

Why are you here

when it could take years
to find out — what?
It’s all so slippery,
and may not cohere.

And yet, you’re here    ...

Is it what you revere?

How do you know?

Until it glows volcanic. He was a god
Before anachronism, before the tasks
That had been craft were jobbed out to machine.
By dint of   hammer-song he makes his keen,
Raw point, and crowns utility with rose:
Quincunx of facets petaling its head.

Now we’re all “friends,” there is no love but Like,
A semi-demi goddess, something like
A reality-TV star look-alike,
Named Simile or Me Two. So we like
In order to be liked. It isn’t like
There’s Love or Hate now. Even plain “dislike”

Is frowned on: there’s no button for it. Like
Is something you can quantify: each “like”
You gather’s almost something money-like,
Token of virtual support. “Please like
This page to stamp out hunger.” And you’d like
To end hunger and climate change alike,

But it’s unlikely Like does diddly. Like
Just twiddles its unopposing thumbs-ups, like-
Wise props up scarecrow silences. “I’m like,
 So OVER him,” I overhear. “But, like,
He doesn’t get it. Like, you know? He’s like
It’s all OK. Like I don’t even LIKE

Him anymore. Whatever. I’m all like ... ”
Take “like” out of our chat, we’d all alike
Flounder, agape, gesticulating like
A foreign film sans subtitles, fall like
Dumb phones to mooted desuetude. Unlike
With other crutches, um, when we use “like,”

We’re not just buying time on credit: Like
Displaces other words; crowds, cuckoo-like,
Endangered hatchlings from the nest. (Click “like”
If you’re against extinction!) Like is like
Invasive zebra mussels, or it’s like
Those nutria-things, or kudzu, or belike

Redundant fast food franchises, each like
(More like) the next. Those poets who dislike
Inversions, archaisms, who just like
Plain English as she’s spoke — why isn’t “like”
Their (literally) every other word? I’d like
Us just to admit that’s what real speech is like.

But as you like, my friend. Yes, we’re alike,
How we pronounce, say, lichen, and dislike
Cancer and war. So like this page. Click Like."
234,Song of the Shattering Vessels,Peter Cole,"Either the world is coming together,
or else the world is falling apart —
     here — now — along these letters,
     against the walls of every heart. 

Today, tomorrow, within its weather,
the end or beginning’s about to start —
     the world impossibly coming together
     or very possibly falling apart.

Now the lovers’ mouths are open —
maybe the miracle’s about to start:
      the world within us coming together,
      because all around us it’s falling apart. 

Even as they speak, he wonders,
even as the fear departs:
     Is that the world coming together?
     Can they keep it from falling apart?

The image, gradually, is growing sharper;
now the sound is like a dart:
     It seemed their world was coming together,
     but in fact it was falling apart.

That’s the nightmare, that’s the terror,
that’s the Isaac of this art —
     which sees that the world might come together
      if only we’re willing to take it apart. 

The dream, the lure, is the prayer’s answer,
which can’t be plotted on any chart —
    as we know the world that’s coming together
    without our knowing is falling apart."

Diagonal for which we had no visual cue save for 
An antler dropped by a constellation —
As the ragged half   leaned nearer, the second storm of cloying snow 
Began pulling on the shocked, still-looming splitting, and its branches dragged 
Lower like ripped hems it was tripping over
Until they rustled on the roof under which I
Quickly made dinner, each noise a threat from a body under which we so recently 
Said, Thank goodness for our tree, how it has accompanied us all these years,
Thank goodness for its recitation of the seasons out our windows and over
The little lot of our yard, thank goodness for the birdsong and  squirrel games 
Which keep us from living alone, and for its proffered shade, the crack of the bat
Resounding through September when its dime-sized acorns 
Land on the tin awning next door. Have

With destruction.

A judge chose the elder girl’s back matter;
Her finish was more fine and far matter.
She got the prize, and his heart; soon they wed.
“But the younger’s sitter’s not a smatter
Less meet; I’ll marry her,” his brother said.
It went so well, their joys were so perfected,
That after them a temple was erected
In honor of  Venus Callipygus.
No other church — though I don’t know its rite —
Could so, from head to epididymis,
Move me with deep devotion to its site.

took the shape of   the pile of   bricks underneath.
Another flew off the back of a truck,

oil well miles under the ocean. 
There is no tarp for that raging figure in the mind

that sits in a corner and shreds receipts
and newspapers. There is no tarp for dread,

whose only recourse is language
so approximate it hardly means what it means:

He is not here. She is sick. She cannot remember
her name. He is old. He is ashamed."

its paintwork blistered and peeled from weeks at sea.
The town storyteller wasted no time in getting to work:

had slammed that door in the face of a Freemason’s son,
who in turn had bulldozed both farm and family
over the cliff, except for the girl, who lived now
by the light and heat of a driftwood fire on a beach.

There was some plan to use the door as a jetty
or landing-stage, but it was all bullshit, the usual idle talk.
That’s when he left and never returned. Him I won’t name — 
not known for his big ideas or carpentry skills,
a famous non-swimmer, but last seen sailing out,
riding the current and rounding the point in a small boat
with tell-tale flashes of almost certainly purple paint."

Come for duty’s sake (as girls do) we watch
The sly very old woman wile away from her pious
And stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.
She pours big drinks. We think of what
Has crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh in
And muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,
Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,
Now Babel, then of  ivory, of  the Shulamite,
Collapsed to this keen dame moving among
Herself. She hums, she plays with used bright
Ghosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come here
My child, and feel it, dear. A crooking finger
Shows how hot the oven is.

(Also she is alive with hate.
Also she is afraid of  hell. Also, we wish
We might, illiberal, uncompassionate,
Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)

Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still
Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.
We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.
We learn time’s pleasure, catch our future and its cure.
We’re dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kin
To any after this of  those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,
Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure.

243,The City of Dreadful Night,James Thomson (Bysshe Vanolis),"As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: All was black,
In heaven no single star, on earth no track;
A brooding hush without a stir or note,
The air so thick it clotted in my throat;
And thus for hours; then some enormous things
Swooped past with savage cries and clanking wings:
      But I strode on austere;
      No hope could have no fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Eyes of fire
Glared at me throbbing with a starved desire;
The hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breath
Was hot upon me from deep jaws of death;
Sharp claws, swift talons, fleshless fingers cold
Plucked at me from the bushes, tried to hold:
      But I strode on austere;
      No hope could have no fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Lo you, there,
That hillock burning with a brazen glare;
Those myriad dusky flames with points a-glow
Which writhed and hissed and darted to and fro;
A Sabbath of the Serpents, heaped pell-mell
For Devil's roll-call and some fête of Hell:
      Yet I strode on austere;
      No hope could have no fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Meteors ran
And crossed their javelins on the black sky-span;
The zenith opened to a gulf of flame,
The dreadful thunderbolts jarred earth's fixed frame:
The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged
And weltered round me sole there unsubmerged:
      Yet I strode on austere;
      No hope could have no fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Air once more,
And I was close upon a wild sea-shore;
Enormous cliffs arose on either hand,
The deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand;
White foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept and flew;
The sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and blue:
      And I strode on austere;
      No hope could have no fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: On the left
The sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft;
There stopped and burned out black, except a rim,
A bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim;
Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west,
And stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest:
      Still I strode on austere;
      No hope could have no fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: From the right
A shape came slowly with a ruddy light;
A woman with a red lamp in her hand,
Bareheaded and barefooted on that strand;
O desolation moving with such grace!
O anguish with such beauty in thy face.
      I fell as on my bier,
      Hope travailed with such fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: I was twain,
Two selves distinct that cannot join again;
One stood apart and knew but could not stir,
And watched the other stark in swoon and her;
And she came on, and never turned aside,
Between such sun and moon and roaring tide:
      And as she came more near
      My soul grew mad with fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: Hell is mild
And piteous matched with that accursèd wild;
A large black sign was on her breast that bowed,
A broad black band ran down her snow-white shroud;
That lamp she held was her own burning heart,
Whose blood-drops trickled step by step apart;
      The mystery was clear;
      Mad rage had swallowed fear.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: By the sea
She knelt and bent above that senseless me;
Those lamp-drops fell upon my white brow there,
She tried to cleanse them with her tears and hair;
She murmured words of pity, love, and woe,
She heeded not the level rushing flow:
      And mad with rage and fear,
      I stood stonebound so near.

As I came through the desert thus it was,
As I came through the desert: When the tide
Swept up to her there kneeling by my side,
She clasped that corpse-like me, and they were borne
Away, and this vile me was left forlorn;
I know the whole sea cannot quench that heart,
Or cleanse that brow, or wash those two apart:
      They love; their doom is drear,
      Yet they nor hope nor fear;
But I, what do I here?"
244,Flowers from a New Love after the Divorce,Paisley Rekdal,"Cut back the stems an inch to keep in bloom.
So instructs the florist’s note
enclosed inside the flowers.
Who knew what was cut
could heal again, the green wounds close,
stitching themselves together?

It doesn’t matter. The flowers, red
and white, will bloom awhile, then wither.
You sit in an unlit room and watch
the vase throw crystal shadows through the dark.
The flowers’ colors are so lovely they’re painful.
In a week, you’ll have to throw them out.

It’s only hope that makes you take out scissors,
separate each bloom and cut
where you last measured. Did you know
Venus was said to turn into a virgin
each time she bathed? She did it
as a mark of love. She did it

so as to please her lovers. Perhaps,
overwhelmed by pain,
she eventually stopped bathing
altogether. It doesn’t matter. It’s a pleasure
to feel the green nubs stripped, watch the stems
refresh under your blade. They’re here

because they’re beautiful. They glow
inside your crystal vase. And yet
the flowers by themselves are nothing:
only a refraction of color that,
in a week or two, will be thrown out.
Day by day, the water lowers. The red-

and-white heads droop, blacken at the stems.
It doesn’t matter. Even cut stems heal.
But what is the point of pain if it heals?
 Some things should last forever, instructs
the florist’s note. Pleasure, 
says one god. Shame, says another.

Venus heads, they call these flowers.
In a week or two, you’ll lose the note,
have to call the florist up.
 With sympathy, you’ll think he says.
Perhaps: With love. It doesn’t matter.
You’ve stopped bathing. Alone,

you sit before the crystal
vase refracting you in pieces
through the dark. You watch
the pale skin bloom inside it, wither.
You petal, inch by inch.
You turn red and white together."
245,Homeland Security,Geoffrey Brock,"The four am cries 
of my son worm 
through the double 
foam of earplugs 

and diazepam. 
The smoke alarm’s 
green eye glows. 
Beneath the cries, 

the squirm and bristle 
of the night’s catch 
of fiddlebacks 
on the glue-traps 

guarding our bed. 
Necrotic music. 
Scored in my head. 
And all night columns 

of ants have tramped 
through the ruins 
of my sleep, bearing 
the fipronil 

I left for them 
home to their queen. 
Patriot ants. 
Out of republics 

endlessly perishing. 
If I can hold 
out long enough, 
maybe my wife 

will go. If she 
waits long enough, 
maybe he’ll go back 
down on his own."
246,The Nights,Geoffrey Brock,"The screamer sleeps, inside.
The desert's wide awake:
the mouse, the rattlesnake.
I've come out here to hide,

behind our house, below
the riddled sky, afraid
of what our bodies made.
To the south: Mexico...

These are the nights men run.
Guaymas before midday,
a beach-town life...I play
it out. Such things are done.

The Rincons seep like a stain
into the paling east.
The borders are policed.
The wail, nearby, of a train."
247,If Feeling Isn't In It,John Brehm,"You can take it away, as far as I'm concerned—I'd rather spend the afternoon with a nice dog. I'm not kidding. Dogs have what a lot of poems lack: excitements and responses, a sense of play the ability to impart warmth, elation . . . .  
                                                                                   Howard Moss

Dogs will also lick your face if you let them.
Their bodies will shiver with happiness.
A simple walk in the park is just about
the height of contentment for them, followed
by a bowl of food, a bowl of water,
a place to curl up and sleep. Someone
to scratch them where they can't reach
and smooth their foreheads and talk to them.
Dogs also have a natural dislike of mailmen
and other bringers of bad news and will
bite them on your behalf. Dogs can smell
fear and also love with perfect accuracy.
There is no use pretending with them.
Nor do they pretend. If a dog is happy
or sad or nervous or bored or ashamed
or sunk in contemplation, everybody knows it.
They make no secret of themselves.
You can even tell what they're dreaming about
by the way their legs jerk and try to run
on the slippery ground of sleep.
Nor are they given to pretentious self-importance.
They don't try to impress you with how serious
or sensitive they are. They just feel everything
full blast. Everything is off the charts
with them. More than once I've seen a dog
waiting for its owner outside a café
practically implode with worry. “Oh, God,
what if she doesn't come back this time?
What will I do? Who will take care of me?
I loved her so much and now she's gone
and I'm tied to a post surrounded by people
who don't look or smell or sound like her at all.”
And when she does come, what a flurry
of commotion, what a chorus of yelping
and cooing and leaps straight up into the air!
It's almost unbearable, this sudden
fullness after such total loss, to see
the world made whole again by a hand
on the shoulder and a voice like no other."
248,Landscape Survey,John Brehm,"And what about this boulder,
knocked off the moutaintop and
tumbled down a thousand years ago

to lodge against the streambank,
does it waste itself with worry
about how things are going

to turn out? Does the current
slicing around it stop itself mid-
stream because it can't get past

all it's left behind back at
the source or up in the clouds
where its waters first fell

to earth? And these trees,
would they double over and
clutch themselves or lash out

furiously if they were to discover
what the other trees really
thought of them? Would the wind

reascend into the sky forever,
like an in-drawn breath,
if it knew it was fated simply

to sweep the earth of windlessness,
to touch everything and keep
nothing and be beheld by no one?"
249,Second Helpings,John Brehm,"I wear my heart on my sleeve,
or rather both sleeves, since
it's usually broken.

Sometimes when I join my hands
to pray, the jagged edges
briefly touch,

like a plate that fell and cracked
apart from being asked
to hold too much."
250,Sotto Voce,John Brehm,"To strip away this incessant chatter,
yes, but what lies underneath it?

Death, of course, or our fear of death.
Which is why we talk so much,

bury our heads in books, turn forests
into pages and pages into mirrors

in which we see ourselves appear
and disappear. When I look up

from the story I've been reading
about the Jews in Nazi Germany

and the silence that closed their
mouths forever, I see a girl outside

the cafe smiling in at her father
who smiles back but cannot hear her.

She makes all kinds of gestures
with her hands, mimes herself

inside an invisible box and breaks
down laughing. Then she gathers

her breath and blows it against
the window. It is not snowing

outside, the leaves have hardly begun
to turn, the season is merely poised

for the long descent, but still
the glass steams up. And in this

little cloud of warmth that's come
from deep inside her body, she

writes a single joyful word, which
vanishes almost before she finishes."
379,Sonnet 121: 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,William Shakespeare,"’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
When not to be receives reproach of being, 
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing.
For why should others’ false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood?
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, 
Which in their wills count bad that I think good?
No, I am that I am; and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own:
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown, 
    Unless this general evil they maintain:
    All men are bad and in their badness reign."
380,"Sonnet 123: No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change",William Shakespeare,"No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
They are but dressings of a former sight.
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told.
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
Not wondering at the present nor the past;
For thy records and what we see doth lie,
Made more or less by that continual haste.
   This I do vow, and this shall ever be:
   I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee."
381,Sonnet 133: Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan,William Shakespeare,"Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:
Is’t not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed. 
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, 
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard:
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee, 
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me."
382,"Sonnet 139: O, call not me to justify the wrong",William Shakespeare,"O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Use power with power, and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere; but in my sight, 
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;
What need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o’erpressed defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries—
    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain."
383,"Sonnet 142: Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate",William Shakespeare,"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, 
Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, 
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be. 
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied."
384,"Sonnet 147: My love is as a fever, longing still",William Shakespeare,"My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Th’ uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, 
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care, 
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen’s are,
At random from the truth vainly expressed:
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night."
385,A Knot of Worms,Marsha Truman Cooper,"As day began to break, we passed
the “honk for worms” sign,
passed it honking again
and again, to wake up the worms
my dad said. It was only
about another half mile to
the aspen grove and our worm digs.
The humus, spongy and almost
black, turned over easily.
I used my bare hands to put
some moist earth into a coffee can
and, as the aspen glittered
in the risen sun, I gently
slid the fresh, fat bait into my container.
I heard the worms still in the ground
gurgle as they tried to escape,
while the ones in the can began
to ball up as their numbers grew.
Streamside, surrounded by mountains
with snow lingering into summer,
I picked out a worm and my dad
arranged it on the hook to save
my small fingers. Now you can purchase
a time-share on that land.
The colony of aspen, thinned
by the builders, continues to
tremble. No amount of honking
brings back the worms."
386,"School photo, found after the Joplin tornado",Laura Dimmit,"“Joey, 4th grade, 1992” 

He’s been on the fridge since it happened,
sneaking glances from underneath the cat
magnet at our dinners, coffee habits, arguments.
We posted him on the database of items found,
hoping that someone would recognize his messy
hair, Batman t-shirt, blue eyes, but no one
answered the post or claimed him.
Somewhere a childhood photo album is not
quite complete, or a grandmother’s mantelpiece;
an uncle’s wallet. One afternoon I got restless,
flipped through my old yearbooks, trying to find him,
looking to see how he might have aged: did he lose
the chubby cheeks? dye his hair? how long
did he have to wear braces? But he’s too young
to have passed me in the halls, the picture just
a stranger, a small reminder of the whirling aftermath
when Joplin was clutching at scraps: everything displaced,
even this poor kid who doesn’t even know he’s lost."
387,Eight Presidents,Allan Peterson,"October five. Seven years older in dog years and then your November
the day record snowfalls hit Randolph New Hampshire in forty-three
and I am thinking of something intimate and impossible to waste:
Brazil’s undiscovered caverns of amethyst     endless smooth oval stones
along Washington’s moody Pacific chewing a continent. But I am wrong.
We pass St. Michael’s the cemetery that asks the public to mow and weed it
and perhaps draw larger conclusions about the already wasted and tidy up names
frayed at the edges by the ions that bind     by age the chemical salt of time
that jostles stones over at their bases to remind us or alter their sentiments.
We read and read and each time nothing new has come up on their markers.
At home we hear the fishermen bring up their nets smack water to scare them.
By now the flounder’s secret pocket where its heart and everything separate
from meat and bone is cleaned and empty as a silk purse not a nickel left
down in the freezer. Nothing really shines but this: I have loved you
eight presidents. Forty years. Five point seven in dog."
388,Moon Missing,Allan Peterson,"I was so worried the hickory I recognized
had died from salt burn in the last hurricane
I may have passed by vervain and apple haw
like they didn’t matter, but this spring
it put out seven shoots from its base.
Still, the oldest trick is the moon missing,
then the “new” moon appears,
though we know it’s the old one, and we pretend
to be taken in like the mother or baby
behind the bath towel.
Really it’s the moon winking,
being the stone that holds stones and now footprints.
And when I tell Frances, I see she is a moon
motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting
a lamp, a face that awakens on paper."
389,The Totality of Facts,Allan Peterson,"The laughing gull that flew behind the fencepost
and never came out was the beginning
and then a hand smaller than my hand covered Wisconsin
with a gesture for explanation.
In the afternoon there are pauses between the words
through which commas can grow like daisy fleabane.
A fish with an osprey in its back emerges from the Sound
and nothing can be learned by more analysis.
The book of her hair opens to its binding and I leaf through
the glorious pages of appreciation and that’s not all.
We could not have turned fast enough to catch
light and leftovers from so much of what happened:
the swift figures behind you like a planet’s dark
companion, ships entering and leaving the hall closet
the real and imagined between which is no difference."
390,Big Country,Michael Robbins,"Fiddle no further, Führer. Rome is built.
It took all day. Now let us so
love the world. I’m just thinking out loud.
My stigmata bring out my eyes.

The smallpox uses every part of  the blanket,
and the forest is a lady’s purse.
The Indian is a pink Chihuahua peeking 
his head from the designer zipper.

Out here it’s mostly light from the fifteenth
century slamming into the planet.
I can’t see the forest for the burn unit.
All the planet does is bitch bitch bitch.

I know it’s last minute but could you put
out my eyes? At the subatomic level, 
helmeted gods help themselves to gold.
Up here? The body’s an isolation ward."
391,"The Butcher’s Apprentice, 1911–1914",Adam Kirsch,"The Butcher’s Apprentice, 1911–1914 by August Sander 
 The high white collar and the bowler hat,
The black coat of respectability,
The starched cuff and the brandished cigarette
Are what he has decided we will see,
Though in the closet hangs an apron flecked
With bits of  brain beside the rubber boots
Stained brown from wading through the bloody slick
That by the end of every workday coats
The killing floor he stands on. He declines
To illustrate as in a children’s book
The work he does, although it will define
Him every time the photograph he took
Is shown and captioned for posterity —
Even as his proud eyes and carriage say
That what he is is not what he would be,
In a just world where no one had to slay."
392,A Chair in Snow,Jane Hirshfield,"A chair in snow
should be
like any other object whited
 & rounded

and yet a chair in snow is always sad

more than a bed
more than a hat or house
a chair is shaped for just one thing

to hold
a soul its quick and few bendable
hours

perhaps a king

not to hold snow
not to hold flowers"
393,Cityscape,Eavan Boland,"I have a word for it —
the way the surface waited all day
to be a silvery pause between sky and city —
which is elver.

And another one for how
the bay shelved cirrus clouds
piled up at the edge of the Irish Sea, 
which is elver too.

The old Blackrock baths 
have been neglected now for fifty years,
fine cracks in the tiles 
visible as they never were when

I can I can I can
shouted Harry Vernon as 
he dived from the highest board 
curving down into salt and urine

his cry fading out 
through the half century it took 
to hear as a child that a glass eel
had been seen 

entering the seawater baths at twilight —
also known as elver —
and immediately
the word begins

a delicate migration —
a fine crazing healing in the tiles —
the sky deepening above a city 
that has always been

unsettled between sluice gates and the Irish Sea 
to which there now comes at dusk
a translucent visitor
yearning for the estuary."
394,Currying the Fallow-Colored Horse,Lucie Brock-Broido,"And to the curious I say, Don’t be naïve.

The soul, like a trinket, is a she.

I lay down in the tweed of one man that first frost night.

I did not like the wool of  him.

You have one mitochondrial speck of evidence on your cleat.

They can take you down for that.

Did I forget to mention that when you’re dead

You’re dead a long time.

My uncle, dying, told me this when asked, 

Why stay here for such suffering.

A chimney swift flits through the fumatorium. 

I long for one last Blue democracy, 

Which has broke my heart a while.

How many minutes have I left, the lover asked, 

To still be beautiful?

I took his blond face in my hands and kissed him blondly

                                                                                      On his mouth."
395,The Dead House,J. T. Barbarese,"Fireplace blocked,
sealed with
cardboard, and taped.
Furniture trashed,
paneling smashed.
On the second floor

mid-corridor, 
a rotting cat
furry and fey
in a nap 
of  gore 
glued flat

to a spot
on the floor, 
ether-sweet 
in a frieze of decay,
up-staring, popeyed,
pissed.

The screens I installed
belled out, belled in.
Every window
cracked, broken,
or forgotten, left open. 
The in-gusting Atlantic 

left smelling sick. 
A shade softly crashed
on a sash,
 finish nails and a bare
 molly bolt fanfared
me from the gloom.

Google the address:
from outer space 
it’s a bare green blot, 
treeless, erased,
terns where we made love,
gulls where we fought."
396,Emerald Spider Between Rose Thorns,Dean Young,"Imagine, not even or really ever tasting
a peach until well over 50, not once
sympathizing with Blake naked in his garden
insisting on angels until getting off the table
and coming home with my new heart. How absurd
to still have a body in this rainbow-gored,
crickety world and how ridiculous to be given one
in the first place, to be an object
like an orchid is an object, or a stone,
so bruisable and plummeting, arms
waving from the evening-ignited lake,
heading singing in the furnace feral and sweet,
tears that make the face grotesque,
tears that make it pure. How easy
it is now to get drunk on a single whiff 
like a hummingbird or ant, on the laughter
of one woman and who knew how much I’d miss
that inner light of snow now that I’m in Texas."
397,Everyday Escapees,Dean Young,"My poor students, all I ask of them
is to grow antennae, lie down with lava
and rise with snow, grow tongues from
their math assignments and no, Melissa,

your mother won’t approve of the bioluminescent
smear on your communion dress. The world fidgets
in uneasy relationship to our statements
about it nevertheless producing silver

buds from ragged limbs like the luster
in late Frank Sinatra songs. Finally,
when I got off the sixth floor, I felt
like I was walking out into the sky

and aren’t we all pedestrians of air?
Doesn’t it feel all wrong to turn our backs
on the ocean? On an ant? On those Chagall
windows you have to go through a gauntlet

of ancient armor to get to? What was her name,
that night nurse so deft her blood draws
didn’t wake me up? Don’t get me wrong, I want
to wake up. I want my old dog to show me

all that wolf-light she hides inside
even though she thinks I won’t understand,
even though her vet and I conspire
to keep her alive forever."
398,A Fable,Anna Maria Hong,"Purveyor of  rot and whatnot, 
entrepreneur of  I forgot, 
with wrists hard as hammers — 
that birthmark a slot — 

grip it, strip it, flip it hard — 
ramp my shard.

& a match — 

Gone the way of  wax & worms — 
gone like November 2011 — 
sweet by nature, mean by culture —

said the Fox to the Grapes. 
“I love you,” replied the Grapes."
399,Fooled Me for Years with the Wrong Pronouns,Gwyneth Lewis,"You made me cry in cruel stations,
So I missed many trains. You married others 
In plausible buildings. The subsequent son
Became my boss. You promised me nothing
But blamed me for doubting when who wouldn’t.
If  I knew how to please you — who have found 
Out my faults. In dreams I’m wild with guilt. Have pity
Kill it. Then, when I’ve lost all hope,
Kiss me again, your mouth so open — 
I’d give anything for one more night — 
That I go without thought. Don’t bite. No,
Mark me. My husband already knows
Exactly what owns me."
400,For Jane,Stephen Stepanchev,"I know that rarity precedes extinction,
Like that of the purple orchid in my garden,
Whose sudden disappearance rattled me.

Jane, in her way, is also beautiful.
And therefore near extinction, I suppose.
She is certainly rare and fragile of  bone.

She insists she is dying, day by dubious day,
And spends her evenings looking at photographs
Of  her mother, who never believed in love.

Rare Jane, I worship you. But I can’t deny
You access to the endless
With its river of cold stars."
401,Gouldian Kit,Lucie Brock-Broido,"What makes you think I’m an eccentric, he said, in London
To the rag of the reporters who had gathered to report 

On his eccentricities — the tin sink light enough for traveling, but 
Deep enough to swallow his exquisite hands in water filled with ice.

A budgerigar accompanies, perched atop the fugue of Hindemith. 
                                
                                 You are trembling now like the librarian reading 
                                 To herself out loud in her Arctic room

Composed entirely of snow.

A broadcast (high fidelity) bound by the quiet of the land and
The Mennonite who told him

                                We are in this world, but are not of this world,

You see. From the notebook of  your partial list of symptoms, phobias:

Fever, paranoia, polio (subclinical), ankle-foot phenomenon, 
The possibility of  bluish spots. Everything one does is fear

Not being of this world or in this world enough.

                                There is no world I know, without some word of   it."
402,An hour is not a house,Jane Hirshfield,"An hour is not a house,
a life is not a house,
you do not go through them as if
they were doors to another.

Yet an hour can have shape and proportion,
four walls, a ceiling.
An hour can be dropped like a glass.

Some want quiet as others want bread.
Some want sleep.

My eyes went
to the window, as a cat or dog left alone does."
403,Hum for the Bolt,Jamaal May,"It could of course be silk. Fifty yards or so
of the next closest thing to water to the touch,
or it could just as easily be a shaft of  wood 

crumpling a man struck between spaulder and helm. 
But now, with the rain making a noisy erasure 
of this town, it is the flash that arrives 

and leaves at nearly the same moment. It’s what I want 
to be in this moment, in this doorway, 
because much as I’d love to be the silk-shimmer 

against the curve of anyone’s arm, 
as brutal and impeccable as it’d be to soar 
from a crossbow with a whistle and have a man 

switch off upon my arrival, it is nothing 
compared to that moment when I eat the dark,
draw shadows in quick strokes across wall

and start a tongue counting

To the line of the cheek, finding

The rags of  her skirt, her wrist
In a bony line forever

Her body from its native air until
She is ready for the page, 
For the street vendor, for

To loss and to laissez-faire adds
The odor of acid and the little,
Pitiless tragedy of  being imagined.

  So mastered.”
                                       —Yeats

I was too shy to say anything but Your poems are so beautiful.
What kinds of things, feelings, or ideas inspire you,
I mean, outside the raw experiences of your life?
He turned a strange crosshatched color
as if he stood in a clouded painting, and said, Thanks,
but no other phenomena intrude upon my starlit mind.
 
I see you are wondering what this is all about. Don’t mind
me, I’m talking to myself again. Yes, poetry is nice and often beautiful,
yet it doesn’t beget much attention, money, or even a simple thanks
for placing the best words in the best order. That’s when I forget all about your
incessant demands, and the restless subject leaps the stream in Technicolor—
until the Remembrancer appears and says, Stop this wasteful life.
 
 Doctor, lawyer, thief. These fancies of yours could cost a life
or worse, two. Meanwhile, he perceives my gifted body upholding my mind
as I’m explaining my stuff on the Unicorn Tapestries, cheeks starting to color,
feathers ruffling, quiet shudders. He shrugs, Your content sounds too beautiful
but I’d like to read it sometime. Okay. He says all the right things, like I love you
Hyacinth Girl. Things get interesting until the sudden blow: Thanks
 
For the memories. What I’ll think seeing his new work in The New Yorker is Thanks
for nothing, asshole, as he drops me for that prolific pastoral life
with his wife upstate. The more I think about it, it all depends upon your
phantom attention. Surely a world embroiders itself in one’s mind
at any moment, words resounding, ardent present clarifyingly beautiful
And beautifully truthful. You know? Here I should put in a lapis color
 
Or a murky midnight blue. Or have the crowd stagger by in a riot of color
pinning down the helpless beast with spears and ritualistic thanks
to their gods. What one really wants to get at is the real, the eternally beautiful
like The White Album or something. That’s what makes one perilous life
worth living. All the brute indifference, humiliation, and failure can put one in the   
             mind
to give up, freak out, kill somebody, heart battered, so mastered. Oh you
 
Wherever I go, on the subway, in my cubicle, at play, in sleep, it’s always you
of the air, overpowering my senses like a Dutch master in one pure color,
its fiction at full speed, walls breaking, a clarity panorama for the mind
hunting for meaning and finding it at last! Now look at all the work I did, and not
            one thanks
Not even flowers. Off you rush to watch him accept another award in that life
We can only dream of. From where you sit it all seems so beautiful
 
And I finally understand you. For that I can’t express enough thanks
As the subject is the best color for me in the difficulty of this lonely life.
It’s always caught up in my mind, what could be more beautiful."
419,Topiary,Camille Guthrie,"I cannot know twisted Henriette of the plant kingdom
Engrafted with a crutch. And yet her bulbous concerns
Effuse a solid blue from inside,
Like a steel Dryad, and her gaze effaced
 
Shines with distended power. Otherwise
These clusterjewels would not dazzle us so,
As limbs proliferate through her pulped brain
From dendrites where creation flared
 
And this crippled tree would seem defaced,
 J’Accuse! beneath the lace of this clipped sister
And would not glisten in synaptic blasts
 
Would not, from all the reaching boughs of self,
Burst like ripe sapphires: for here there is no place
 That does not see you. You shake forth a nest."
420,Murderer [Part I],Curzio Malaparte,"I
 
 The whole of human history … 
  
             The whole of human history
            seems to be the story of men who kill,
            and of men who are killed;
            of murderers who light their cigarettes
            with trembling hands,
            and of poor, unlucky kids staring into the eyes
            of those who bring them their deaths.
  
            But history is not about murderers, after all.
            It is just the story of some poor kids.
            The whole history of the world
            is just the story of millions of poor kids
            overwhelmed by the fear of death, or
            by the fear of bringing death to others.
  
            My mother had closed her eyes
            and was breathing softly.
            Every so often, her right hand,
            abandoned on the white sheet,
            would shift slightly, opening and closing
            like the hand of a sleeping baby.
  
            The nurse came into the room just then,
            as I had begun to tell the story of Jaco.
            She opened the door as slowly as possible,
            but I felt her presence behind my shoulders
            bending over the bed,
            looking at my mother.
  
            She is sleeping, said the nurse.
            Don't wake her.
  
             I didn't turn around,
            but continued my story in a low whisper.
            When I got to the part about the grenade,
            I heard the nurse tiptoeing out,
            closing the door behind her,
  
            silently.
  
The grenade exploded a few feet away, while Jaco was helping to carry two wounded soldiers down the hill to the hospital tent. By the time I got to him, he was stretched out on the grass, breathing heavily. Everyone around him had been killed. He watched as I approached, and when I was close, he smiled.
     He had just been promoted to lieutenant, even though he had not yet turned nineteen. Six months ago, when we were getting ready to leave Italy, Ercolani had taken me aside and said: Look out for Jaco. He's like a brother to me. Make sure nothing bad happens to him.
     I was irritated: War isn't a game. It doesn't play by the rules. If something bad happens to him, tough luck.
     But from that day on, I kept my eye on Jacoboni: he was about the same age as me, but seemed much younger. In any event, he turned out to be a good officer: he did his duty like all the others, like a good kid. He took war seriously, convinced he would go home in one piece, back to his family in Monterotondo, near Rome. And it was perhaps because of this that he smiled as I sat down next to him.
      I saw right away that it was hopeless. The grenade had torn open his abdomen and his intestines were cascading down his leg past his knees and coiling onto the ground.
       We were surrounded by the dead: hundreds of them in the forest around us. Most were Italian, but there were a few Germans: they had advanced this far before we had finally pushed them back. Their dead lay alongside ours.
  
 It began to rain.
  
            The rain on the oak leaves
            made a soft music, like women whispering.
            Every so often, it would intensify
            as it darted here, and there through the trees,
            rising and then fading away.
 
            The green reflection of the forest
            washed everything the color of water,
            gave an extraordinary lightness to things:
            to the solid trunks of the trees,
            to the bodies lying in the grass.
 
            Glimpsed through the branches of the trees,
            the sky appeared light and remote:
            A sky made of silk,
            luminous and pure, serene,
            scrubbed of clouds and fog.
 
            The rain was coming from who knows where.
            Or maybe it was not even rain,
            just the memory of some rain
            falling from the depths of past summers,
            falling from some childhood summer long ago."
421,Murderer [Part IV],Curzio Malaparte,"IV

So it did not come as a surprise—a relief, almost—when we heard the tac-tac-tac of machine guns and the thud of grenades rising up from the woods below. The Germans were advancing again through the tangle of bomb-shattered branches, clearing a path with axe-blows, foreheads crushed beneath the overhang of great steel helmets, gleaming eyes fixed dead ahead.
     The rest of that day was bitter, and many of us fell forever headlong in the grass. But toward evening the voice of battle began to diminish, and then from the depths of the forest we could hear the song of the wounded: the serene, monotonous, sad-hopeful song of the wounded, joining the chorus of birds hidden in the foliage as they welcomed the return of the moon.
     It was still daylight, but the moon was rising sweetly from behind the forested mountains of Reims.
 
 It was green against a white and tender sky… 
           
            A moon from the forest of Ardennes,
            a moon from the country of Rimbaud, of Verlaine,
            a delicate green moon, round and light,
            entering the room of the sky from behind a screen of branches
            as if stepping delicately out of the earth,
            rising up from the grass, causing the tree-branches to blush
            transparent and sweet.
 
            Like startled birds, we had settled again around Jaco:
            I can't stand it any more, he smiled.
            Don't let me suffer.
            But now his smile was tired:
            a tired smile
            in a face clenched like a fist.
 
            Jaco's suffering gnawed away at us,
            sinking into our bones.
            There is nothing so terrible, or so sweet,
            so touching, as that animal, man,
            when he gives over to death.
            I felt my shirt sticking to my back. My face
            and the faces of the others were beaded with sweat,
            like the sweet face of Nazzareno Jacoboni.
            And little by little I became aware
            that everyone had slowly turned toward me,
            pinning me down with their eyes.
 
            Along with Jaco's terrible, unbearable suffering,
            something else was sinking into us, little by little,
            something which was not ours.
            Something strong, strange, insistent,
            was slowly being born within us.
            Jaco stared at me,
            even he now stared at me,
            expecting something,
            and I felt a new idea forming inside me,
            and inside the others.
           
            I can't go on, said Jaco.
            I looked away to the green moon hanging behind the trees:
            It had taken on the round shapeliness
            of a fragrant leaf: a laurel leaf,
            perhaps, or sage, or mint,
            a great green leaf, transparent with evening daylight.
            The sun had not yet settled into the forest,
            and his last warm rays struck the trunks of the trees
            leaving some of them wounded, bleeding.
            Others—the oaks, the beeches, poplars and birches—
            reflected the light in a strange way,
            as if they were made of glass.
 
            That glassy light, which the sun, just before it sets,
            draws from the earth's waters,
            drinks from its grass, from its leaves,
            from the trunks of its trees,
            to slake its thirst.
 
            All of them stared at me,
            but I was not aware of what I was doing.
            I felt my hands moving,
            but I did not know what I was doing until
            I found myself standing
            and saw them looking up at me,
            and Jacoboni smiling at me strangely,
            and felt something cold and smooth in my hands.
 
            And finally I was aware that I was standing
            with a rifle in my hands.
            I closed my eyes, and fired.
            I fired with my eyes closed,
            one shot after another.
           
            And then, when the echo of the shots
            had melted into the woods,
            there was a great silence.
 
            With my eyes still closed,
            rifle still in hand,
            I turned and took a few steps.
            Suddenly I heard: Murderer! Murderer!
 
             It was the voice of woman, terrible,
            the voice of a sister, desperate,
            the voice of a mother, of a lover.
            And at that moment nothing could have been more terrible
            than that voice of a woman,
            that voice of a mother, of a sister,
            of a lover, crying:
 
            Murderer!
 
      I opened my eyes and saw one of the girls running toward me, her hands like claws, as if she intended to tear me apart. She screamed again: Murderer! and then stopped abruptly a few paces away, filthy, disheveled, with a great bewilderment, spreading across her face, a wondrous pity. I stood in front of her, rifle in my hands, tears in my eyes.
     And they were certainly a marvelous thing, those tears, not only for her, but for me as well.
 
 My mother . . . 
 
             My mother was lying on her back,
             her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be asleep;
             Even her hand, abandoned on the sheets,
             had dozed off.
             I fell silent,
             looking at the moon rising inch by inch
            over the olive trees of Settignano.
            It gave me great solace,
             that moon and those trees.
             That bright silver moon over silvery trees,
             that moon in the shape of an olive leaf,
             clean and transparent,
             shining like a vein of silver, pulsing
             through green marble
             in the incensed darkness of a church."
422,Today We Fly,Curzio Malaparte,"One Sunday morning,
instead of studying The Illiad,
I escaped with Bino to Florence,
to see what miracles the aviator Manissero
would perform.
 
Whether he would demonstrate the art of Daedalus
or the folly of Icarus.
 
We found the whole city festooned with banners
on which was written: Today We Fly.
They were everywhere: Via Cerretani,
Via Cavour, Via Calzaioli, along the embankments.
There was even one stretched across the Arno
with an enormous red Today We Fly
reflected in the yellow water
like the famous In Hoc Signo Vinces of Ponte Milvio.
 
We almost expected that Florence itself
would lift off,
with its towers, its statues, its red roofs,
with its cathedral's nodding cupola
rising slowly through the clouds
like a balloon.
 
Every window, doorway and marketplace
was crammed with upturned faces,
scanning the sky for some sign
of the direction the wind might take,
and whether there would come with it
the smell of rain.
 
We were most afraid of the wind from Bologna,
proud enemy to the north.
Almost as bad would have been the wind from the south,
from Empoli, called the scirocco;
or Petrarch's east wind from Arezzo,
with its Grecian-accented gusts.
But even a soft westerly breeze from Pistoia—
even that sweet breath from the ballads of Cino,
full of dolce stil novo—
would have spelled disaster.
 
Luckily the sky that Sunday was clear,
and the air was still.
The leaves on the trees around the parade ground
stood at ease,
and the outlines of the hills were crisp,
sharply etched in the crystalline air.
 Just wait. Today we really will fly,
said Bino with a smile.
  
For overnight Today We Fly had become a catchphrase,
fit for every occasion:
for a straw hat rolling along the pavement;
for a parasol blown around the corner;
for a dress tangled up between the knees,
or blown flapping like a flag around rounded hips.
  
It was the happy time of the first aeroplanes,
before the War
when it was fashionable for women
to wear enormous hairdos
as wide as their dresses were narrow.
And those gigantic wings of hair,
which were the objects of so many of our teenage jokes,
have remained braided together in my heart
with the fluttering Today We Fly:
maliciously good-natured mementos
of my adolescence.
 
We hurried over the parade grounds,
and there was Manissero
crouched in the cockpit of his machine:
a contraption of woven reeds and papery cloth,
with a motor so small it made you think a horsefly
was pinned to the frame behind his shoulders.
 
The crowd had assembled, holding its breath,
waiting for the miracle to happen,
when suddenly the leaves began to tremble,
and the blades of grass of nod.
A few tiny white clouds sprouted
like windowsills on Monte Morello,
and the women's wings of hair began to come untucked
from their padded nests of false braids.
 
Manissero jumped out of his cockpit
at the first sign of this unfortunate breeze,
waved amicably to the crowd with a gloved hand,
and yanked off his leather helmet
while a banner was unfurled above the grandstands:
 
 Because of Unsettled Weather, Today We Will Not Fly.
  
It was hard to imagine anything more settled
than the weather that day:
a magnificent, paradisiacal Sunday in spring.
But all it took was this delicate breeze,
this perfumed zephyr from Pistoia,
to spoil everything.
  
We returned to Prato with heavy hearts,
and I took up my study of the abandoned Illiad,
quiet and discouraged.
  
Thursday morning the rumor began to spread
that the following Sunday,
if the weather was favorable,
Manissero would attempt to fly
from Florence to Prato and back:
thirty kilometers round trip!
  
By Saturday, Via Magnolfi, the Corso,
Via del'Oche, Via Firenzuola—all the streets of Prato
were crisscrossed with white banners
carrying those fateful words:
  
 Today We Fly.
  
By noon Sunday
rivers of people from the surrounding the countryside
were flooding into the city through its five gates,
and by three o'clock
the cathedral square was awash
with a restless and noisy crowd,
pale, perspiring, noses in the air.
I stood among them with my classmates,
all of us impatient, barely kept in check
by the stern gaze of our principal
and the softer reprimands of the teachers.
  
We began to hear a new word:
 Velivolo!
dancing above the buzz of the crowd.
But that name for aeroplane, recently coined by d'Annunzio,
seemed too delicate for the gaping mouths of dumbstruck farmers:
it was still fresh, still smelled of varnish,
and was as sweet and sharp in the mouth
as mint candy.
 Velivolo!
  
Suddenly a white wing appeared in the blue sky
and the reed-and-paper bird
grew larger, came closer,
hovered over the cathedral square.
  
A cry, only one, but from a thousand throats;
a cry more of fear than joy:
then sudden silence,
bursting with anguish.
Manissero was perhaps two hundred meters above our heads,
and it seemed miraculous.
Miraculous not just because he was flying,
but because he was flying over Prato,
in the virgin sky of Prato!
which only the kites of children had dared to caress
until today.
 
As long as the flying was over Florence,
things were fine:
certain facts, in Florence, are understandable,
are legitimate, and fit within in the logic of history.
 
But over Prato!
Over Prato where for centuries now
nothing miraculous had happened.
Not on the ground,
and not in the sky.
Especially not in the sky.
 
Over Prato!
Where it seemed that miracles had become impossible,
caught as we were
between the historic pride of Florence
and the ancient jealousy of Pistoia.
Sacrificed,
reduced to poor relations,
robbed not only of everything that we had,
which would have been bad enough,
but of everything we might have wanted to have.
 
Yet here was Manissero flying in our sky,
in the neglected sky of Prato.
And he was flying, or so it seemed,
better than he might have flown in the sky of Florence.
Better than in any other sky in Tuscany!
 
After a moment, though, the suspicion began to grow
that he might fly as far as Pistoia.
Everyone held their breath,
balanced on one foot,
hearts stopped between beats:
 
 The treacherous sky of Pistoia!
  
Some us took out our keys,
ready to rattle them against such a betrayal.
The rest of us set our lips
to whistle in defiance.
But Manissero veered to the right,
and after a wide turn over Prato
he headed back toward Florence.
  
The city detonated with joy.
I lost myself in the crowd, beyond thought,
proud citizen of Prato to my bones.
It wouldn't be too much to say that all of us, that day,
felt we held a piece of sky in our hands.
  
That night, in my dreams, the Achaean army,
assembling beneath the walls of Troy,
came to a halt, astonished at what lay before them:
stretching from tower to tower
immense white banners
on which great red letters spelled out:
 Today We Fly.
  
And then Troy, the city of Priam—
which from a distance resembled nothing more than Prato—
detached itself gently from the earth,
hovered with its banners snapping in the breeze,
and drifted away into the clear sky,
swinging gently from side to side.
  
Maddened Achilles ran along below, commanding:
 Stop! Stop!
  
And from the buzz of his accent
you might have thought he was from Pistoia.
 
Beloved Priam, from the top of the Trojan gates.
answered sweetly:
 Too Late. Too Late.
  
And his voice had all soft accents of Prato,
taking flight."
423,Xian of Eight Rivers,Curzio Malaparte,"China is made of earth, of sun-dried mud.
 
In this part of China everything is made from the earth:
the houses, the walls around cities, and villages,
the tombs scattered over the countryside.
Even the people.
 
There are hills below that appear to be piles of mud
set out to dry in the sun, naked,
without a single tree or bush.
They crowd around the landscape
like the coils of bulging intestines
tossed on the ground outside butchers' shops,
slowly unraveling.
 
Sometimes we fly so low that we almost touch them.
 
And then I notice that the wind has brushed
some kind of pattern into the earth: a mysterious alphabet
written in the mud,
struggling to communicate something precise.
But there is not a single animal
or human being in the yellow desert below.
 
Not a single village.
  
Suddenly we are landing: Xian,
the geographic center of China,
where Chinese civilization was born,
in the cradle of the Yellow River.
 
In front of the terminal,
three children are playing with a lump of earth:
they are bundled up in jackets
and brightly printed cotton trousers.
I join them in their game
until a young woman comes out of the terminal
to call me in for dinner.
One of the children grabs me by my overcoat,
to keep me from leaving.
So do the other two, clinging to me,
asking me not to go.
 
The young woman comes out again,
and yells at them to stop.
 
They let go, disappointed.
One of them calls to me as I turn away:
 Come back soon!
  
We eat quickly and then prepare to take off for Lanchow.
My three new friends wave goodbye to me. The littlest one
gives me a present: a pebble,
a precious gift.
In this part of China there are no stones.
You have to go to Karelia to find stone,
very far north; or to the Caucasus;
or to southern Siberia, along the slopes of the Pamir,
slanting toward the steppes of Central Asia.
  
I put the pebble in my pocket,
to take back home, to show what a precious gift
I was given by a little Chinese girl: a pebble
from the cradle of Chinese civilization.
  
A civilization made of earth,
a civilization without bones,
without a skeleton for support.
A civilization of assembled customs,
which suddenly unravel,
dissolving into thousands of separate gestures,
thousands of calligraphic icons,
thousands of smells, colors, flavors,
thousands of different shades. And then just as suddenly
they solidify again into tradition, memory, habit.
  
It is this absence of stone, of solid, durable material,
which makes China such an exquisite thing.
Everything is reflected:
an unimaginable number of movements,
of patterns, thoughts, images,
of which we see the copies in immense numbers,
but never the originals.
  
The originals were destroyed long ago.
  
Here are the four elements out of which China is made:
Earth, Wood, Porcelain, Silk.
The most durable of these is Silk.
  
I should add a fifth element: Poetry,
which is the most durable of all."
424,Song (“The world is full of loss ... ”),Muriel Rukeyser,"The world is full of loss; bring, wind, my love,
         my home is where we make our meeting-place,
         and love whatever I shall touch and read
         within that face.

Lift, wind, my exile from my eyes;
         peace to look, life to listen and confess,
         freedom to find to find to find
         that nakedness."

He stays out of habit; I cook
out of love for things that move.
 
We grow accustomed to each other’s
trails and smells, the skins we’ve shed
 
along the long, long road
of rubbing each other smooth.
 
Till all the skins we’ve shed lie sparkling
like so many stones in this desert land.
 
I scoop him up in my hand

428,The Man Moves Earth,Cathy Song,"The man moves earth
to dispel grief.
He digs holes
the size of cars.
In proportion to what is taken
what is given multiplies—
rain-swollen ponds
and dirt mounds
rooted with flame-tipped flowers.
He carries trees like children
struggling to be set down.
Trees that have lived
out their lives,
he cuts and stacks
like loaves of bread
which he will feed the fire.
The green smoke sweetens
his house.

The woman sweeps air
to banish sadness.
She dusts floors,
polishes objects
made of clay and wood.
In proportion to what is taken
what is given multiplies—
the task of something
else to clean.
Gleaming appliances
beg to be smudged,
breathed upon by small children
and large animals
flicking out hope
as she whirls by,
flap of tongue,
scratch of paw,
sweetly reminding her.

The man moves earth,
the woman sweeps air.
Together they pull water
out of the other,
pull with the muscular
ache of the living,
hauling from the deep
well of the body
the rain-swollen,
the flame-tipped,
the milk-fed—
all that cycles
through lives moving,
lives sweeping, water
circulating between them
like breath,
drawn out of leaves by light."
429,Church Basement,Maureen Ash,"The church knelt heavy
above us as we attended Sunday School,
circled by age group and hunkered
on little wood folding chairs
where we gave our nickels, said
our verses, heard the stories, sang
the solid, swinging songs.

It could have been God above
in the pews, His restless love sifting
with dust from the joists. We little
seeds swelled in the stone cellar, bursting
to grow toward the light.

Maybe it was that I liked how, upstairs, outside,
an avid sun stormed down, burning the sharp-
edged shadows back to their buildings, or
how the winter air knifed
after the dreamy basement.

Maybe the day we learned whatever
would have kept me believing
I was just watching light
poke from the high, small window
and tilt to the floor where I could make it
a gold strap on my shoe, wrap
my ankle, embrace
any part of me."

You can have the brown shed, the field mice
        hiding under the mower, the wasp’s nest on the door,

if I can have the house of the dead oak,
        its hollowed center and feather-lined cave.

You can have the deck at midnight, the possum
        vacuuming the yard in its white prowl,

if I can have the yard of wild dreaming, pesky
        raccoons, and the roaming, occasional bear.

You can have the whole house, window to window,

if I can have the screened porch at dawn,

She does not know we hear—
she is playing to the river,

a song for the water, the flow
of an unknown melody to the rocky
bluffs beyond, for the mist

that was this morning, shroud
of past lives: fishermen
and riverboat gamblers, tugboat captains

and log raftsmen, pioneer and native
slipping through the eddies of time.
She plays for them all, both dirge

like a postage stamp,

one of a shifting stack
sealed in wax paper

always signaled snack, 
peanut butter or cheese

their wings of wide arrival,
necks long, legs stretched out
above strands of earth
where they arrive
with the shine of water,
stories, interminable
language of exchanges
descended from the sky

earth made only of crane
from bank to bank of the river
as far as you can see
the ancient story made new."

toward the end of his vacation. He showed
his vacation to his camera, which pictured it,
preserving it forever: the river, the trees,
the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat
behind which he stood with his camera
preserving his vacation even as he was having it
so that after he had had it he would still
have it. It would be there. With a flick
of a switch, there it would be. But he
would not be in it. He would never be in it."

I stand in my one place

down the road. I am yonder,
further than the chunk of your stone.
Right now, directly,
I am persimmon falling free
and the prisoner opening up
in me.
Don’t come through my door and
want to run my house. I am
the angel who sweep air in and out my own
dancing body. I got good eyes. I can see.
A good piece down the road. Clear to
God murmuring in me. My head is the burning
bush. What I hold in my hand is the promised
land. I set my people free in me.
And we walk without wandering like people named
after mere plants,
because we are tree
and high-stepping roots
cake-walking
in this promised place.
  
Where I go is where I am now.
Don’t mess with me: you hurt yourself.
In the middle of my stride now. I am walking
yes indeed I am walking through my own house.
I am walking yes indeed on my own piece of road.
Toting my own load
and yours and mine.
I tell you
I feel fine and clear this morning even
when it’s night and a full moon with my thumbprint
on it.
Everything is clamorous and quiet.
            I am the only One here.
            And we don’t break. No indeed.

father paid the way.
His teeth salt inside the grin.

of leaping toward a light
suddenly running into ecstasy
or heat, exquisitely blind
in the body racing inside it-
self. A little fit of imagining.
 
Thin arms, cropped wings,
to hold the bristly branches of fir, and sing-
ing, sisters and brothers itching,
happy from angelhair fine as a strand of cat
hair split six ways and brushed into the skin
to itch and itch again.
We were wild and giddy with gifts.
 
It was then and always as all souls itch and spin
in lit-red coats that float down this narrow vein,
so we spin in O, to someone who loves us
and suffers the world for each turn before a mirror,
quiet as ice, we fall all through at last
here in memory’s tiny Paradise."
437,The Gulf of Blues,Angela Jackson,"On the other end of the line
he sounds like my brother
but is my father
telling me about Coony who is fat.
His whole body like a stomach
round all round, fat even on his head.
Eighty and heavy.
How he joked Coony about his weight,
joking him about a tow truck he’d need
to haul him out of the tub
like an old sunken ship pulled out of
the gulf of blues,
leaving whirlpools in the porcelain.
 
“Quit all that eating and drinking,”
my daddy say he said to him.
“Quit pointing in that garden and reach down
to get it.” My daddy say he joked him,
ribbed him good.
(And I know my daddy laughed gap-toothed,
his mouth, throat, chest, and gut wide
open for the signifying jest.
His gray hair striking back time.)
 
He sounds like my brother when he was
a little boy, digging in the encyclopedia
for the cause of something obscure, occult,
trying to figure out how old Coony slipped
in the bathtub that was always there
and died like that. Baby Sister called
to tell it first and she wasn’t joking
after all like my daddy thought she was,
Death a sad trick children pull.
 
On the other end of the line
my father sounds like my brother now.
I know how
Dying, bitter or tender, is the dark water that keeps
us young.
And this gulf of blues, deep and shiny,
the only place to be
between Time and Eternity."
438,Miz Rosa Rides the Bus,Angela Jackson,"That day in December I sat down
by Miss Muffet of Montgomery.
I was myriad-weary. Feets swole
from sewing seams on a filthy fabric;
tired-sore a pedalin’ the rusty Singer;
  
dingy cotton thread jammed in the eye.
All lifelong I’d slide through century-reams
loathsome with tears. Dreaming my own
silk-self.
  
It was not like they all say. Miss Liberty Muffet
she didn’t
jump at the sight of me.
Not exactly.
They hauled me
away—a thousand kicking legs pinned down.
  
The rest of me I tell you—a cloud.
Beautiful trouble on the dead December
horizon. Come to sit in judgment.
  
How many miles as the Jim Crow flies?
Over oceans and some. I rumbled.
They couldn’t hold me down. Long.
No.
  
My feets were tired. My eyes were
sore. My heart was raw from hemming
dirty edges of Miss L. Muffet’s garment.
I rode again.
  
A thousand bloody miles after the Crow flies
that day in December long remembered when I sat down
beside Miss Muffet of Montgomery.
I said—like the joke say—What’s in the bowl, Thief?
I said—That’s your curse.
I said—This my way.
She slipped her frock, disembarked,
settled in the suburbs, deaf, mute, lewd, and blind.
The bowl she left behind. The empty bowl mine.
The spoiled dress.
  
Jim Crow dies and ravens come with crumbs.
They say—Eat and be satisfied.
I fast and pray and ride."
439,Mules and Women,Angela Jackson,"with respect to Zora and the Ground of the African Church

Sorrowtalked eye-to-eye forgiven is no mere burden.
The one who sings is no mere beast.
The one who slips the harness of the horror stands alive
            as earth.
  
Today I can watch the wind and it is blue smoke.
I shake myself inside my dress, consider rain and choose
            Shine.
I was walking down Mississippi River Street
            and a ghost stopped me.
No one could see it but me,
standing in the middle of the sidewalk
smilin at a haint with his hat in his hand
     instead of his head when he can tote that too.
  
     When one mule die
     the rest neigh-cry
     till the wagon take the dead thing away.
 
     Mississippi River Street rampant with noise,
     radiant, won’t hold still.
     But I have walked on blue black water.
     Watched dead rise before the wagon came.
  
     Everywhere I see mules,
     open mouths sing blues, then be human, then
     beyond.
  
Funerals, weddings, baptisms
I take off my skin, hang it up
like a soaked quilt to dry the tears
and sweat from feeling. I stand naked before Church,
holding Dr. Watts closer than my sagging, girlish breasts.
My soul wears no clothes when she sing.
It is all being in love with more than one
man who is one whole man you can look into his eyes
without blinking.
  
     Where would I go to hide?
Dr. Watts standing with my skin hooked on his finger
and I am next to him solid and living the song
            with no words     .
that every born-again mule knew in death and in life
            before
birth, now hums true again hot in the chest and throat
breaking natural out the mouth like breathing.
  
     Where would I go to hide?
Sit down, rock my soul like my baby and Dr. Watts
climb in my lap and moan for the milk no mother can buy
            or borrow
only make in hearts of her eyes, in lines of the palms
            of her hands.
And where would I find lines with no skin?
  
     Where would I go to hide?
I tell you I am living now. Like in Mississippi
Grandmama’s bedroom sitting on the high bed
     you could break
          your neck leaving.
Cousin Chubby said fried fish, greens, and cornbread was
good eatin. I am good livin. Blue smoke watching,
naked, haint-smiling, entertaining Dr. Watts, dreaming
of a man with a white liver who can’t kill me,
who love mulish women, hainted ones,
     I am the sainted one
naked with no sense of memory but good like God rocking
hums in my lap and looking for no hiding place even if
wind be blue smoke hurricane and I make red milk
in the hearts of my eyes and reach out my lifelines to
a hopeless haint I can stand myself.
  
Naked now, where would I want to go to hide? From this
funeral wedding death and birth baptism
the sliding tears washing my soul cleaner than
Dr. Watts’ whistle or the look in a sweatin man’s
eyes when he lookin at a perfect, brutal sun
killing him with living while he lick his lips and dream
of water, then put his shoulder behind a woman
guiding him while he dig in and groove the earth
            to the quick
deep endless quick.
  
     Where would I go
     Where would I go to hide this
     yes-crying love yielding beyond flesh yet
     subsumed by sweat
  
     Where would I go naked so
     following blues and Dr. Watts
     like a double-seeing shadow
     standing before you with only blue smoke
     between us
     humming yes and yes and yes
  
     subsumed by sweat and yielding
     beyond mere flesh."
440,Strolling,Angela Jackson,"Some places you could die in,
                                                if you could just go on
                                                living there.
The boy, his legs bare and small,
swinging in the stroller, sockless, suede-shoed feet touching
the runner. He can walk, but the woman
keeps him from running
into the street. He won’t obey
but listens to everything we say. Head tilted, face changing
with the conversation. Green leaves leap through fences.
Cars wait while we cross. And each bird the boy greets
with its name, “Bird,” flies away. The sky holds everything.
 
The woman pushes her son’s son along. Her arms strong enough
   to hold
nine strong horses prancing.
She’s given her money away
because someone had to bury
a child. That is the worst thing.
A mother burying her child.
 
I would never do that to her, even though it means
what it means.
A thousand years from now
when I am only a dream
I will dream this dream
of strolling.
Perhaps I am doing so now."
441,Woman Watches Ocean on a Reef through a Glass-Bottomed Boat,Angela Jackson,"In the ocean one fish
swallows the other:
a geometric progression of
loss.
You are bigger than I.
The calamity of love
swelling out larger than us.
And what destiny partakes of
our dilemma?
Swallows the cause and effect:
eyes and kissing mouths and enlarged
parts wanting to breathe and wanting.
  
There is no gentle sense to this.
Is there?
Only a kind of terror
at the chain
of events, the scale of loss, the ordered
  
destruction one against the other—
all that something larger
awaits its moment."
442,Aria,David Barber,"What if   it were possible to vanquish
All this shame with a wash of   varnish
Instead of wishing the stain would vanish?

What if   you gave it a glossy finish?
What if   there were a way to burnish
All this foolishness, all the anguish?

What if   you gave yourself   leave to ravish
All these ravages with famished relish?
What if   this were your way to flourish?

What if   the self   you love to punish —
Knavish, peevish, wolfish, sheepish —
Were all slicked up in something lavish?

Why so squeamish? Why make a fetish
Out of everything you must relinquish?
Why not embellish what you can’t abolish?

What would be left if   you couldn’t brandish
All the slavishness you’ve failed to banish?
What would you be without this gibberish?

What if   the true worth of the varnish
Were to replenish your resolve to vanquish
Every vain wish before you vanish?"
443,Beaded Baby Moccasins,Joanne Dominique Dwyer,"If   love is like a doll’s shoe —
the color of nascent snow
that laces over the ankle 
or the polychromatic beaded baby moccasins 
we saw lying in the museum drawer
that belonged to an infant from a sea tribe of seal hunters.
Or the rutilant pink blossoms 
of the locust tree that bloomed in the dark 
while I slept dreaming of my arrival 
on a red-eye wearing a long to the floor skirt —
not of a postulant, but of a flower vendor
or a woman covering disfigurement. 
Freud believed that religious faith 
is a wish-fulfilling illusion.
I can’t locate faith in a carved or uncarved pew.
I’m more focused on the altar boy’s shoes. 
Under his white robe he’s wearing a man’s black loafers 
vastly oversized for his small feet with
sufficient spare space for a coyote den in each toe.
I want to buy him a kite.
If   love is a mezzanine floor we will not fall from, 
a hand holding back my hair from my face 
as I’m sick on the side of the bus. 
The mouth so at home in the vicinity of pavement.
Pew also means to enclose, as in men who were 
as willingly pewed in the parish church 
as their sheep were in night folds.
Freud also believed civilized life imposes suffering,
yet he always wore a dinner jacket.
We delaminate layers of old paint
bleach sheets in the shade.
I take out the oily ham from the beans,
the unflattering photos from the folio, 
the quotes about repressed homosexuality 
being the reason Sigmund’s patient Little Hans
is afraid of   horses."
444,Bon Courage,Amy Gerstler,"Why are the woods so alluring? A forest appears 
to a young girl one morning as she combs 
the dreams out of   her hair. The trees rustle 
and whisper, shimmer and hiss. The forest 
opens and closes, a door loose on its hinges, 
banging in a strong wind. Everything in the dim 
kitchen: the basin, the jug, the skillet, the churn, 
snickers scornfully. In this way a maiden 
is driven toward the dangers of a forest, 
but the forest is our subject, not this young girl.

She’s glad to lie down with trees towering all around.
A certain euphoria sets in. She feels molecular, 
bedeviled, senses someone gently pulling her hair, 
tingles with kisses she won’t receive for years. 
Three felled trees, a sort of chorus, narrate 
her thoughts, or rather channel theirs through her, 
or rather subject her to their peculiar verbal 
restlessness ...    our deepening need for non-being intones 
the largest and most decayed tree, mid-sentence. 
I’m not one of you squeaks the shattered sapling,

blackened by lightning. Their words become metallic 
spangles shivering the air. Will I forget the way home?
the third blurts. Why do I feel like I’m hiding in a giant’s nostril?
the oldest prone pine wants to know. Are we being   freed 
from matter? the sapling asks. Insects are well-intentioned, 
offers the third tree, by way of consolation. Will it grow
impossible to think a thought through to its end? gasps the sapling, 
adding in a panicky voice, I’m becoming spongy! The girl 
feels her hands attach to some distant body. She rises 
to leave, relieved these trees are not talking about her."
445,Corn Maze,David Barber,"Here is where 
You can get nowhere 
Faster than ever
As you go under
Deeper and deeper

In the fertile smother
Of another acre
Like any other
You can’t peer over
And then another

And everywhere
You veer or hare
There you are
Farther and farther
Afield than before

But on you blunder
In the verdant meander
As if   the answer
To looking for cover
Were to bewilder

Your inner minotaur
And near and far were
Neither here nor there
And where you are
Is where you were"
446,Devotions,Bruce Snider,"1 

Nothing passes, Lord, but what you allow.
Mornings the milky sap on my knuckles
burns. Last night the piglets fought then suckled 
in the barn. Still no word. Our one cow
grazes but won’t come in. The pamphlets say: 
Patience is required. I say, let’s try again
but John blames the state, the neighbors, the way 
we wrote our bios, filling out the forms.
Across the road our neighbor starts his truck
while God, feather by feather, downs a wren —
swollen, its black eyes shiny, small dark tongue.
In the drainpipe, something slithers wet and stuck. 
A race runner? A ground skink shedding skin?
Lizards, John tells me, can’t bear live young.

 2 

John tells me: lizards can’t bear live young.
Another of   God’s mysteries: hard rain
muddying the corn. The kind woman 
at the agency said, it takes longer for certain
types of couples. Trash smoke rises like prayer,
the neighbor burning insulation from his shed.
He shows his son how to bind fence where 
a crippled chicken pecks at scattered feed.
They talk, lean close. Rusted toys fill
the side yard: old trucks, a bicycle tire,
a punctured red bucket now a sieve.
In the back acre, ram mounts ewe, the whole
field coupling late spring. When   John walks by, 
I kiss him. Most days we keep to ourselves.

 3 

I kiss him most days. We keep to ourselves 
by the roadside. Two greasy boxes; a sign:
FREE. We take the runt, her warm body beside
us in the truck, milk-breathed and unwormed.
I imagine her shuddering out of the womb, wet
ground covered with slime. Strange to think
of   her moving inside some animal’s gut, 
the source of each day’s warm alien kick. 
At home John makes her a bed from old 
field shirts, a soap and vinegar bath for fleas
while in my lap she chews my hand and shivers.
I brush her fuzzy scruff, the too-large head.
She nips at my finger that holds a piece of cheese, 
her wet tongue asking what a man can mother. 

 4 

Even I doubt how a man can mother 
when I see the neighbor shout, chuck a stone 
at his son. When I shoot him a look, he turns: 
mind your own business. The hot sun withers
the peonies John planted on the side of the hill,
dirt gone hard with the sudden change of weather.
Sweating, I mow the lawn, pick up shell 
casings in the yard, the crow’s strict feathers.
All day I want to break something, stick 
a fork in the fan blades to feel the pinch.
Coming home late again from the shop, 
John carries two rabbits slung from a hook. 
He cleans, for hours, his rifle on the porch.
Above us: the moon rises. An easy shot.

 5 

Above us the sun rises, bright and hot,
steaming the back pond where black flies stall.
In the pasture, our neighbor castrates his bulls
using a spreading tool with red rubber slats. 
The restless cattle graze an unshorn meadow.
On TV: a baby in Toledo in a locked car. 
The mother went to work and forgot, windows
up in summer’s heat. The camera blurs
over the lot as a medic lifts the blanketed heap
from the back seat in the crew’s full view.
Gawkers circle. The mother weeps. Watching, 
I can peaches, letting the pale fruit darken. 
Beyond the window, bulls still graze the field.
They feed. The bloodless sacks swing, blacken.

 6 

Steer feed. The bloodless sacks hang, blackened.
On the radio: Haggard’s I’d rather be gone. 
John tends to ordinary things: replaces the drain-
pipe in the kitchen sink, sharpens knives again.
I watch the neighbor teach his son to paint 
the tool shed all afternoon. Soon, they wrestle,
throw a ball, the boy laughing into his father’s chest.
In the paper I read the births and deaths,
hear a sudden hammering from behind,
John cursing the warped floorboards, pushing hard
the back door, which still won’t budge an inch.
Again today no miracles at hand, 
just, in the field, wrens who stab at milkweed pods,
a nuthatch bargaining from its split branch.

 7 

A nuthatch bargains from its split branch.
Our neighbor stops by, complains our fence
breaks his field. It must be moved eight inches.
The puppy — Annie, we call her — pushes
her nose in everything, the front yard, the garden,
finds, across the road, the neighbor’s trash —
drags stripped wire, eggshells that harden
like the bones she buries off   his porch.
I want to say we are consoled by her,
but each day John jumps when he hears the phone. 
We walk over and over down the worn 
path to the empty mailbox: Maybe soon.
Some nights we make love. We sleep arm to arm.
We wake to our neighbor yelling at his son. 

 8 

Again we wake, our neighbor yelling at his son, 
poor kid standing by the porch. Tracking mud,
he backs from the shouting, his father’s raised fist. 
Later I will see him sulking near our feed shed,
knotting an old piece of garden hose, kicking dust.
I’ll smile, ask if   he’s OK. But right now 
I listen to John’s quiet breathing beside me. 
Faith, they say, is Abraham asked to slaughter 
his boy on a mountaintop. But sometimes 
it’s just the peeling shed in gray weather, 
the leather harness softened, then gone rough.
All day today the back pond will teem with carp. 
The clover will brighten. For now we lie together 
into late morning. Some days, it is enough."
447,Dolphins at Seven Weeks,Rachel Jamison Webster,"Inward lush unpetaling purpose in pink blooms of sleep, and I no longer needed to be separate. I was living there then, at the edge of the sea. And my friends came to visit, trying for a baby, not sure how to read me on that island of dozy sunlight. And there it was: familiarity edged with fear, the way we’d feed each other sandwiches and wonder if we should have wanted something other. We walked the folded cliffs over conifer fronds and mud runneling rocks slick with dropped fruit and rotting camellias to pause at the first ridge. We looked through high pines at the blue moving tides, then his finger caught a snag in the water and another and we saw — glinting fins wheeling the sheen, thousands playing in pods coming closer like the souls slippering into our bodies, attaching to matter as flippers angle into a ferrying strand. We too are a species, I realized. We too could know that as joy."
448,The Eye,Rae Armantrout,"These brown piles

449,Farewell to Matilda,Thomas Love Peacock,"Oui, pour jamais              Chassons l’image              De la volage              Que j’adorais.              PARNY.

Matilda, farewell! Fate has doom’d us to part,
 But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart;
 No longer is love with my reason at strife,
 Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life.
  
 As together we roam’d, I the passion confess’d,
 Which thy beauty and virtue had rais’d in my breast;
 That the passion was mutual thou mad’st me believe,
 And I thought my Matilda could never deceive.
  
 My Matilda! no, false one! my claims I resign:
 Thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine:
 I now scorn thee as much as I lov’d thee before,
 Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more.
  
 Though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find,
 While folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind,
 Though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize,
 Thou art shunn’d by the good, and contemn’d by the wise.
  
 Than mine what affection more fervent could be,
 When I thought ev’ry virtue was center’d in thee?
 Of the vows thou hast broken I will not complain,
 For I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain.
  
 Oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov’d
 As that fancied perfection I formerly lov’d,
 Nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul,
 Could have dimm’d the dear image then stamp’d on my soul.
  
 How bright were the pictures, untinted with shade,
 By Hope’s glowing pencil on Fancy pourtray’d!
 Sweet visions of bliss! which I could not retain;
 For they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain.
  
 Some other, perhaps, to Matilda is dear,
 Some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere;
 May he fix thy light passions, now wav’ring as air,
 Then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair!
  
 Repent not, Matilda, return not to me:
 Unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be:
 In vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum’d,
 For love, once extinguish’d, is never relum’d."
450,from from Sir Proteus,Thomas Love Peacock,"I.
  
 Ille Ego
  
 Oh! list to me: for I’m about
    To catch the fire of Chaucer,
 And spin in doleful measure out
    The tale of Johnny Raw, sir;
  
 Who, bent upon a desperate plan
    To make the people stare,
 Set off full speed for Hindoostan
    Upon Old Poulter’s mare.
  
 Tramp! tramp! across the land he went;
    Splash! splash! across the sea;
 And then he gave his bragging vent—
    “Pray who can ride like me?
  
 “For I’m the man, who sallied forth
    To rout the classic forces,
 And swore this mare was far more worth
    Than both fierce Hector’s horses.
  
 “Old Homer from his throne I struck,
    To Virgil gave a punch,
 And in the place of both I stuck
    The doughty Mother Bunch,
  
 “To France I galloped on my roan,
    Whose mettle nought can quail;
 There squatted on the tomb of Joan,
    And piped a dismal tale.
  
 “A wild and wondrous stave I sung,
    To make my hearers weep:
 But when I looked, and held my tongue,
    I found them fast asleep!
  
 “Oh! then, a furious oath I swore,
    Some dire revenge to seek;
 And conjured up, to make them roar,
    Stout Taffy and his leek.
  
 “To Heaven and Hell I rode away,
    In spite of wind and weather:
 Trumped up a diabolic lay;
    And cursed them all together.
  
 “Now, Proteus! rise, thou changeful seer!
    To spirit up my mare:
 In every shape but those appear,
    Which Taste and Nature wear.”"
451,Girl-Watching,Dan Brown,"In the years I’ve been at this
(Lots, not to be precise)
You’d think that once or twice
At least I would have seen
Some anomalies. I mean
Some major ones. As in
Not feet but little wheels,
Or crests like cockatiels’.
Where are they keeping the girls
With a chrome exterior,
Or an extra derriere?
Apparently nowhere.
Assuming my sample’s valid,
The pool is limited 
To the standard types I’ve tallied;
Such variance as there is
In the usual congeries
Of   physiognomies —
And yet enough of   it 
To be worth the looking at. 
The walking by, for that,
Of   the same girl over and over
Would be no cross to bear
If   it were that one there."
452,Hoffnung,Amy Gerstler,"He fancies his chances are good with her, 
unaware that in the years since the war

on the kitchen wall, frozen for days where 
it will likely die in noble clinging mode

just under the cobwebby heating vent, 
is to confirm your need for more friends 

and a greater daily quota of sunlight. 
To raise C.’s hopes that T. can stop 

drinking and then to liken those 
hopes to fields of undulating grain, 

alfalfa perhaps, is to wish C. hip deep 
in acres of unscythed denial. The blind 

typist hopes she’ll be hired tonight without 
her disability becoming an issue. L. said he felt 

hope’s rhizomes race throughout his body, 
radiating in all directions, like some incipient 

disease he’d been fighting since childhood. 
Hope, he said, it’s as insidious as bitterness. 

If mother earth only knew how much we 
loved one another she would creak, shudder, 

and split like a macheted melon, releasing 
the fiery ball of molten hope at her core."
453,I Flew into Denver April,Adrian C. Louis,"I flew into Denver April.
Rock salt and sand peppered the asphalt
reflecting myself on a downtown street
where I’d paused on my route to smell lilacs.
The wanton winds chortled wickedly
over remnant snows in gray clumps of doom
and my heart soared gladly at winter’s death
but an hour later I had whiskey breath
at a dead end bar full of Indians.
A Winnebago woman waltzed with me
and told me how handsome I truly was
so I bought her drinks and felt her hips
and somewhere between the grinds
and dips she lifted my wallet and split."

conception. She calls it why 

and cries all night, 
sleepless, wild.

It seems the way is always
floating and the goal — 

to live so the ghosts we were 
don’t trail us and echo.

I think we are inside a flower,
under a pollen of stars vast as scattered sand.

The air pulses with perfume,
flowers calling to flowers and the ferrying air.

But my eyes are thin and elsewhere.
I am thinking, maybe 

even coming into the soul 
is a difficult birth, squeezed by the body’s vise.

My bent legs like pincers
or the vegetable petals of some tropical flower.

Even my mind gripped by the folds 
of   the flesh, how the cells keep twinning 

themselves out toward complexity.
The tulip trees of   the valley

Their cups fill with rain, rain

our daughter came into me.

I was just learning to be human

It was the beyond in us. And she was."

The years of “sir” (long past “mate,” much less “dearie”), 
of invisibility, of woozy pacifism,
of the preemptive smile of the hard-of-hearing,

of stiff joints and the small pains
that will do me in. The ninth complement
of fresh — stale — cells, the Late Middle Years 
(say, 1400 AD — on the geological calendar),
the years of the incalculable spreading middle, 
the years of speculatively counting down

460,Maria’s Return,Thomas Love Peacock,"The whit’ning ground
           In frost is bound;
    The snow is swiftly falling;
 While coldly blows the northern breeze,
 And whistles through the leafless trees,
    In hollow sounds appalling.
  
           On this cold plain,
           Now reach’d with pain,
    Once stood my father’s dwelling:
 Where smiling pleasure once was found,
 Now desolation frowns around,
    And wintry blasts are yelling.
  
           Hope’s visions wild
           My thoughts beguil’d,
    My earliest days delighting,
 Till unsuspected treach’ry came,
 Beneath affection’s specious name,
    The lovely prospect blighting.
  
           With many a wile
           Of blackest guile
    Did Henry first deceive me:
 What winning words to him were giv’n!
 He swore, by all the pow’rs of Heav’n,
    That he would never leave me.
  
           With fondest truth
           I lov’d the youth:
    My soul, to guilt a stranger,
 Knew not, in those too simple hours,
 That oft beneath the sweetest flow’rs
    Is couch’d the deadliest danger.
  
           With him to roam
           I fled my home;
    I burst the bonds of duty;
 I thought my days in joy would roll;
 But Henry hid a demon’s soul
    Beneath an angel’s beauty!
  
           Shall this poor heart
           E’er cease to smart?
    Oh never! never! never!
 Did av’rice whisper thee, or pride,
 False Henry! for a wealthier bride
    To cast me off for ever?
  
           My sire was poor:
           No golden store
    Had he, no earthly treasure:
 I only could his griefs assuage,
 The only pillar of his age,
    His only source of pleasure.
  
           With anguish wild,
           He miss’d his child,
    And long in vain he sought her:
 The fiercest thunder-bolts of heav’n
 Shall on thy guilty head be driv’n,
    Thou Disobedient Daughter!
  
           I feel his fears,
           I see his tears,
    I hear his groans of sadness:
 My cruel falsehood seal’d his doom:
 He seems to curse me from the tomb,
    And fire my brain to madness!
  
           Oh! keenly blow,
           While drifts the snow,
    The cold nocturnal breezes;
 On me the gath’ring snow-flakes rest,
 And colder grows my friendless breast;
    My very heart-blood freezes!
  
           ‘Tis midnight deep,
           And thousands sleep,
    Unknown to guilt and sorrow;
 They think not of a wretch like me,
 Who cannot, dare not, hope to see
    The rising light to-morrow!
  
           An outcast hurl’d
           From all the world,
    Whom none would love or cherish,
 What now remains to end my woes,
 But here, amid the deep’ning snows,
    To lay me down and perish?
  
           Death’s icy dart
           Invades my heart:
    Just Heav’n! all-good! all-seeing!
 Thy matchless mercy I implore,
 When I must wake, to sleep no more,
    In realms of endless being!"

In plague years,
Hands held back, jocularity

Breathing’s generally wary,
Labored, as they say, when
The end is at hand.
But this is the everyday intake
Of   the imperceptible life force,
Willed now, slow —
Well, just cautious
In inhabited air.
As for ongoing dialogue,
No longer an exuberant plosive
To make a point,
But a new squirreling of air space,
A new sense of  boundary.
Genghis Khan said the hand
Is the first thing one man gives
To another. Not in this war.
A gesture of  limited distance
Now suffices, a nod,
A minor smile or a hand
Slightly raised,
Not in search of   its counterpart,
Just a warning within
The acknowledgment to stand back.
Each beautiful stranger a barbarian
Breathing on the other side of the gate."
464,The Rain-bow,Thomas Love Peacock,"The day has pass’d in storms, though not unmix’d
With transitory calm.   The western clouds,
Dissolving slow, unveil the glorious sun,
Majestic in decline.   The wat’ry east
Glows with the many-tinted arch of Heav’n.
We hail it as a pledge that brighter skies
Shall bless the coming morn.   Thus rolls the day,
The short dark day of life;   with tempests thus,
And fleeting sun-shine chequer’d.   At its close,
When the dread hour draws near, that bursts all ties,
All commerce with the world, Religion pours
Hope’s fairy-colors on the virtuous mind,
And, like the rain-bow on the ev’ning clouds,
Gives the bright promise that a happier dawn
Shall chase the night and silence of the grave."

of a new song far from this lament

I never asked to be the son of a stained mattress
who contemplated venison stew and knew
the shame hidden in grease clouds stuck to the wall
behind the woodstove where Grandmother cooked.
I only wanted to run far, so far from Indian land.
And, God damn it, when I was old enough I did.
I loitered in some great halls of ivy
and allowed the inquisition of education:
electric cattle prods placed lovingly
to the lobes of my earth memories.
I carried the false spirit force of sadness
wrapped in a brown sack in the pocket
of a worn, tweed coat.
In junkie alleyways I whispered of forgotten arrows
in the narrow passages of my own discarded history.
Then, when I was old enough
I ran back to Indian land.
Now I’m thinking of running from here.

Home on leave from Basic Training,
you stood in for me
because I was running scared
through the drugged-out alleys of America,
hiding from those Asian shadows
that would finally ace you and now, now
in the dark victory of your Agent Orange cancer,
it gives me not one ounce of ease
to say fuck Nixon and Kissinger,
fuck all the generals and all

470,This Is the Time of Grasshoppers and All That I See Is Dying,Adrian C. Louis,"Colleen,
this is the time of grasshoppers
and all that I see is dying except
for my virulent love for you.
  
The Cowturdville Star-Times,
which usually has a typo
in every damn column,
says the grasshoppers this year
“are as big as Buicks” and
that’s not bad, but then we
get two eight-point pages
of who had dinner with whom
at the bowling alley café and
who went shopping at Target
in Rapid City and thus the high
church of Adrian the Obscure is sacked.
  
Even my old Dylan tapes are fading,
becoming near-comic antiques.
The grasshoppers are destroying
our yard and they’re as big as
my middle finger saluting God.
The grass is yellow. The trees
look like Agent Orange has hit
but it’s only the jaw-work of those
drab armored insects who dance
in profusion and pure destruction.
  
Sweet woman, dear love of my life,
when you’re not angry and sputtering
at everything and everyone, you
become so childlike, so pure.
Your voice seems to have grown
higher recently, almost a little-girl pitch.
  
Today, like most days, I have you
home for your two-hour reprieve
from the nursing home prison.
We’re sitting at the picnic table in
the backyard staring at the defoliation
of lilacs, brain matter, and honeysuckle.
You’re eating a Hershey Bar and
a crystal glob of snot is hanging
from your nose.
I reach over, pinch it off,
and wipe it on my jeans.
You thrust the last bite
of chocolate into my mouth
as a demented grasshopper
jumps onto your ear.
You scream. I howl
with laughter until you do too.
Happiness comes with a price.
  
This is the times of grasshoppers
and all that I see is dying except
for my swarming love for you.
  
Last night on PBS some
lesioned guy being screwed to death
by legions of viral invisibility
blurted the great cliché of regret:
 I wish I could be twenty
 again and know what
 I know now … 
  
My own regrets are equally foolish.
And, I wonder, how the hell
is it I’ve reached a place
where I’d give what’s left
of my allotment of sunsets
and frozen dinners
for some unholy replay
of just one hour in some nearly
forgotten time and place?
 
Darling,
in the baked soil of the far west,
I first saw the ant lions, those
hairy little bugs who dug funnel
traps for ants in the dry earth.
At twelve, looking over the edge
of one such funnel surrounded by
a circle of tiny stones in the sand,
I aimed a beam of white light
from my magnifying glass
and found I could re-create
a hell of my own accord.
 
Poverty and boredom
made me cruel early on.
The next summer while digging
postholes I found a cache of
those grotesque yellow bugs
we called Children of the Earth
so I piled matches atop them
and barbecued their ugliness.
I was at war with insects.
 
In my fifteenth summer I got
covered with ticks in the sagebrush
and that fall I nervously lost my cherry
in a cathouse called the Green Front
and got cursed with crabs but that’s
not what I want to sing about
at all… come on now.
 This is no bug progression.
 This ain’t no insect sonata.
  
This is only misdirection,
a sleight of hand upon the keys
and the unholy replay of just
one hour in some nearly
forgotten time and place
that I’d like to return to
will remain myth or maybe
a holy, tumescent mystery.
 
And let’s not call
these bloodwords
POETRY or a winter count
of desperate dreams
when reality is much simpler.

I swear to Christ
this is the time of grasshoppers
and all that I see is dying except
for my sparkling love for you."

the nearest land three thousand miles away and under different management,

the diving sun another thirty thousand times that, there is no reality,
only these parlous notions, messages, statements, stylings on the edge of extinction.

Little petillas. A kind of spontaneous zoo of   human recency and arrival
and promontory variorum. Imprudent comb-over thoughts,

rigid and proud eye-catching false thoughts, little jiggling thoughts,
intricate braided-beard thoughts the product of much misplaced patience,

product placement thoughts (which are rather elementary,
and are almost a contradiction in terms), unlike myriad highly-evolved

dog thoughts (no mutts here), pushing a baby in a three-wheeled stroller
whilst running very hard in no shirt and six-pack thoughts,

this a development on the now-obsolete egg and paddle
(what it does to the infant to be impelled at such a rate into the future

whilst facing backwards like an Aeroflot passenger is not recorded —
not that forward is necessarily better), high-concept silky-swishing Afghan hound thoughts,

intrusive bum thoughts, hapless and homeless panhandler thoughts
(a smarte carte loaded with undesirables never far to seek),

low-slung belly-dragging beagle thoughts little better
than the serpent in the Bible, holding hands Adam and Eve thoughts,

foot-shuffling Zimmer frame thoughts, “revolution in mobility” wheelchair and gravel thoughts,
pushed by most likely an illegal attendant borderline thoughts,

candy-striped T-shirt and shorts thoughts, cut-off thoughts,
paired with sometimes nothing more than a bikini top, those three-quarter length

thin and probably amphibious trousers, worn without socks, that men go in for,
suggestive of adaptability and resourcefulness thoughts,

standard over-loud mobile thoughts, (“our relationship is...    ”),
lying immobile on the grass on your back mobile thoughts

(these are different), tourist thoughts, an unexpected preponderance of  Russian thoughts
(though with residential qualifications), borscht belt leopard skin thoughts

dripping with gold and eccentric lamentations, dog and baby both thoughts
(these last thought to be ideally-balanced), high-stepping poodle thoughts

slightly dated straw hat thoughts, reverse baseball cap also thoughts."

you leave in my car. When I hear your name I can’t forget
 
how your long torso pressed against my bare back,
bluish in this early light. Your fingers shot into me, popped
my spine into a wicked arch. There is no lack
 
of how it haunts me still—what I bid—lost, sacked
and wrapped for other girls. I should have looked up
to see who else was bidding, but I studied the folds in your jacket.
My limit is spent, loud and certain as the auctioneer’s racket."
477,The Appeal of Antiques,Allan Peterson,"The intriguing comfort of an imagined past
is entered through objects
the same way we continue the present
but without nostalgia
Parents so long for happiness they say
one life is not enough
and live through their children
But children also live backwards through past candles
crank telephones   carriages
the ascendant animals that lived not in imagination
but in Kansas and before
there was an Oklahoma with its spotted sun
 
In those days a metaphor for Hell was the corn sheller
field corn shriven  shooting out cobs
the grindstone   razor strop   even the ladder of progress
from which Les Westfield slipped
on a mossy rung though his son held the ladder
and fell two stories:
one the feudal structure of the family   two the harmonic
of almost fatal necessity
as the maple stump entered his hip along with the difficult
remission of breath itself
an antique whose furious elaborations mimicked the rose"
478,Are All the Break-Ups in Your Poems Real?,Aimee Nezhukumatathil,"If by real you mean as real as a shark tooth stuck
in your heel, the wetness of a finished lollipop stick,
the surprise of a thumbtack in your purse—
then Yes, every last page is true, every nuance,
bit, and bite. Wait. I have made them up—all of them—
and when I say I am married, it means I married
 all of them, a whole neighborhood of past loves.
Can you imagine the number of bouquets, how many
slices of cake? Even now, my husbands plan a great meal
for us—one chops up some parsley, one stirs a bubbling pot
on the stove. One changes the baby, and one sleeps
in a fat chair. One flips through the newspaper, another
whistles while he shaves in the shower, and every single
one of them wonders what time I am coming home."
479,"Dear Amy Nehzooukammyatootill,",Aimee Nezhukumatathil,"(a found poem, composed entirely of e-mails from various high school students)

If I were to ask you a question about your book
and sum it up into one word it would be, Why?
I think I like Walt Whitman better than you. I just don't
get literature, but for a fast hour and a half read, your book
 
takes the cake. I like how you organized the lines
in that one poem to represent a growing twisting bonsai tree.
Are you going to get a rude reaction when you meet
that one guy in that one poem? I guess you never know.
 
You are very young to be a poet. I also like how your poems take
up an entire page (it makes our reading assignment go faster).
In class we spend so much time dissecting your poems
and then deeply analyzing them. I think I like Walt Whitman
 
better than you, but don’t take offense—you are very good too!
You are young, You are young and pure and really just want
to have a good time. Thank you we have taken a debate
and you are a far better poet than Walt Whitman. And I loved
 
how your poems were easy to read and understand. Hello
my name is Alicia. We read you book and I just loved it.
We also read Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. There
was no competition there. I liked your book a whole lot better.
 
It was an easy read. But poetry is not my favorite type
of literature. Sometimes I am offered drinks and guys
try to talk to me but I too just brush it off and keep dancing.
Every once and a while the creepy mean guys try to offer you
 
things and then they say something. What would you do?
Lastly, I was wondering if you ever wrote a poem that really
didn’t have a deeper meaning but everyone still tried
to give it one anyways? Walt Whitman is better than you."
480,Harlan County,Kate Buckley,"Stepping over the stones of my mother,
chicken bones, straw,
 
the cellar in which the man was found,
that man my grandfather
 
the day the sharecroppers left town,
their son shot dead —
 
the thing whiskey’ll do to a man.
 
The woman who waited under the house at night,
counting ghosts and bobcats through lattice of leaves,
 
walking bare-boned lanes,
toes buried beneath blackened leaves —
 
no cause for worry
if you’ve walked every acre, planted every row.
 
Nothing can get you if you pay it no mind.
 
I tell you these things
so you’ll not mistake my actions for fear,
 
not think I do not know what makes a life,
what makes people do the things they do.
 
I know my fears — I’ve named them,
counted them out one by one
 
like tarot cards, voodoo dolls:
 
birth,
death,
poverty,
obscurity,
that you will leave me,
or I will leave you."
481,My Mother’s Closet,Kate Buckley,"I had a fascination with your dresses — the greens, brocades,
the belted shapes which spoke of you more poignantly
than the photos in their careful frames.
 
Your shoes were their own country, the heels, satins,
the inexplicable mud — I scraped them with small fingernails,
marveling at the gorgeous debris, wishing I had a microscope.
 
I searched your handbags, examined them for signs,
evidence — where you were going, where you had been:
tickets, lipstick, inked hieroglyphics, a broken comb.
 
I even smelled your stockings, sniffing at the crotches
like a dog, frantic for any trace of you, my eyes raking
their length, wondering at ladders, searching for clues.
 
My father came upon me once, cross-legged on the floor,
his sad smile telling me more than any detection —
he took my hand, and closed the door."
482,On Hearing Your News,Kate Buckley,"My eyes lie flat in my skull,
darkened, bruised
 
lashes whip-stitched to swollen lids –
sleep has once again been elusive.
 
My organs weigh more
than they did the day before,
 
swollen with unhappiness,
gorged on regret:
 
tiny fists in my stomach pummeling
the hanging ball of my heart."
483,Red Ghazal,Aimee Nezhukumatathil,"I’ve noticed after a few sips of tea, the tip of her tongue, thin and red
with heat, quickens when she describes her cuts and bruises—deep violets and red.
 
The little girl I baby-sit, hair orange and wild, sits splayed and upside down
on a couch, insists her giant book of dinosaurs is the only one she’ll ever read.
 
The night before I left him, I could not sleep, my eyes fixed on the freckles
of his shoulder, the glow of the clock, my chest heavy with dread.
 
Scientists say they’ll force a rabbit to a bird, a jellyfish with a snake, even
though the pairs clearly do not mix. Some things are not meant to be bred.
 
I almost forgot the weight of a man sitting beside me in bed sheets crumpled
around our waists, both of us with magazines, laughing at the thing he just read.
 
He was so charming—pointed out planets, ghost galaxies, an ellipsis
of ants on the wall. And when he kissed me goodnight, my neck reddened.
 
I’m terrible at cards. Friends huddle in for Euchre, Hearts—beg me to play
with them. When it’s obvious I can clearly win with a black card, I select a red.
 
I throw away my half-finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket, but
my aim is no good. The floor is scattered with fire hazards, declarations unread."
484,The Rolling Saint,Aimee Nezhukumatathil,"Lotan Baba, a holy man from India, rolled on his side for
            four thousand kilometers across the country in his quest for
            world peace and eternal salvation.                                                     
                                                                —Reuters 

He started small: fasting here and there,
days, then weeks. Once, he stood under
a banyan tree for a full seven years, sitting
            for nothing—not even to sleep. It came
            to him in a dream: You must roll
             on this earth, spin your heart in rain,
                         desert, dust. At sunrise he’d stretch, swab
                        any cuts from the day before, and lay prone
                        on the road while his twelve men swept
            the ground in front of him with sisal brooms.
            Even monkeys stopped and stared at this man
            rolling through puddles, past storefronts
where children would throw him pieces
of butter candy he’d try and catch
in his mouth at each rotation. His men
            swept and sang, swept and sang
            of jasmine-throated angels
            and pineapple slices in kulfi cream.
                        He rolled and rolled. Sometimes
                        in his dizzying spins, he thought
                        he heard God. A whisper, but still."
485,Swallowtails,Allan Peterson,"The Emperor thought of his heart as a water wheel
flooding the rice fields of all creation
and bloodied the water for a better harvest.
His warriors hoped for a life with wings.
His swallowtails wrote him the same lines
—the secret of life is a resurrected worm—
He told them eventually time would run backwards
in their hands, now empty where a crossbow went.
 
A theory works if it answers the exceptions.
The writing in the air of swallowtails,
from here to where the time changes at Mexico Beach,
is like writing all the armies of the afterlife
waiting underground in China.
 
We are attuned to shadows. They strafe the shore.
An osprey spins above the trees.
But when a large one stops suddenly above the house,
all the laws have been broken.
A theory that a moment is a warehouse where armies are stacked
to the ceiling, then one falls, is the last exception.
The osprey’s underside is streaked like a zebra swallowtail.
It misses the fish that dove out of the reach of shadows
as the lovers jumped into theirs from the Bay Bridge to Fort Walton.
If any should meet hovering over a milkweed or reflection,
they might say didn’t I know you in another life,
the kind of thing said often in Fort Walton or the Orient
and didn’t plum blossoms freeze in the Emperor’s courtyard."

Well I expect you to go into the

I’m going.
 
pink grimy glossed
entabulature, welted
and tattooed. Enfolded in
ropy ceiling-hangings
but it isn’t a room,
 
and bumblingly sliding
out, little legs of
 
a little girl, bum on the wall/opening
 
pink legs sticking out like a
hermit crab’s, she’s coming!
 
shudder out the little-girl

Send her to school
 
It’s cold, and where should she

her eyes will retract inside.
 
Stroke her riding hood
Settle down, little

487,Twelve Twelve Twelve,Aimee Nezhukumatathil,"a.) When I was twelve, I lived
on the grounds of a mental asylum.
 
 
b). My Filipino mother was a psychiatrist,
so that meant we lived
in the doctor’s quarters—
one of the three big brick houses
that edged the institute.
 
 
c). My younger sister and I practiced Herkies—
our favorite cheerleading jumps—
off the patients’ bleachers near the softball field.
 
 
d). When I was twelve, I aced
the experiments
with celery and food coloring;
they let me skip a whole grade
and get right to The Dissections.
 
 
e). I secretly wished my supply
of grape Bubble Yum would never run out
but I couldn’t figure out how to blow bubbles
and snap the lavender gum like Sara could.
 
 
f). We sold gift wrap and crystals
for a junior high fund-raiser and my mom still asks
 Where are all the crystals I bought?
and
 Why don’t you display them in your house?
  
g). When I was twelve, I worried about
the darkening hair on my legs.
My mother bought me my first training bra—
no cup, just little triangle pieces stitched together—
and then a slice of New York-style cheesecake
to bring home.
  
  
h). Home.
  
  
i). When I was twelve, our house
always smelled of fried lumpia
or ginger.
 
 
j). We had zinnias
as wide as my outstretched hand
nodding at us in our garden.
 
 
k). My school had to create
a whole new bus stop
just for my sister and me,
and everyone stopped talking and stared
when we stepped onto the bus each morning,
smelling of grape gum and ginger roots.
 
 
l.) Just who are these girls?"
488,What I Learned From the Incredible Hulk,Aimee Nezhukumatathil,"When it comes to clothes, make
an allowance for the unexpected.
Be sure the spare in the trunk
of your station wagon with wood paneling
 
isn’t in need of repair. A simple jean jacket
says Hey, if you aren’t trying to smuggle
 rare Incan coins through this peaceful
 little town and kidnap the local orphan,
 
 I can be one heck of a mellow kinda guy.
But no matter how angry a man gets, a smile
and a soft stroke on his bicep can work
wonders. I learned that male chests
 
 also have nipples, warm and established—
green doesn’t always mean envy.
It’s the meadows full of clover
and chicory the Hulk seeks for rest, a return
  
to normal. And sometimes, a woman
gets to go with him, her tiny hands
correcting his rumpled hair, the cuts
in his hand. Green is the space between
  
water and sun, cover for a quiet man,
each rib shuttling drops of liquid light."
489,New Personal Poem,Ted Berrigan,"to Michael Lally

You had your own reasons for getting
In your own way. You didn’t want to be
Clear to yourself. You knew a hell
Of a lot more than you were willing
                 to let yourself know. I felt
Natural love for you on the spot. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Right.
Beautiful. I don’t use the word lightly. I
Protested with whatever love (honesty) (& frontal nudity)
A yes basically reserved Irish Catholic American Providence Rhode
                 Island New Englander is able to manage. You
Are sophisticated, not uncomplicated, not
Naïve, and Not simple. An Entertainer, & I am, too.
Frank O’Hara respected love, so do you, & so do we.
He was himself & I was me. And when we came together
Each ourselves in Iowa, all the way
That was love, & it still is, love, today. Can you see me
In what I say? Because as well I see you know
In what you have to say, I did love Frank, as I do
You, “in the right way”.
That’s just talk, not Logos,
                 a getting down to cases:
I take it as simple particulars that
                 we wear our feelings on our faces."

491,So Going Around Cities,Ted Berrigan,"to Doug & Jan Oliver

“I order you to operate, I was not made to suffer.”
Probing for old wills, and friendships, for to free
to New York City, to be in History, New York City being
History at that time.” “And I traded my nights
for Intensity; & I barter my right to Gold; & I’d traded
my eyes much earlier, when I was circa say seven years old
for ears to hear Who was speaking, & just exactly who
was being told….” & I’m glad
                  I hear your words so clearly
                  & I would not have done it
                                differently
                  & I’m amused at such simplicity, even so,
inside each & every door. And now I’m with you, instantly,
& I’ll see you tomorrow night, and I see you constantly, hopefully
though one or the other of us is often, to the body-mind’s own self
more or less out of sight! Taking walks down any streets, High
Street, Main Street, walk past my doors! Newtown; Nymph Rd
            (on the Mesa); Waveland
Meeting House Lane, in old Southampton; or BelleVue Road
            in England, etcetera
Other roads; Manhattan; see them there where open or shut up behind
            “I’ve traded sweet lines for answers …”
They don’t serve me anymore.” They still serve me on the floor.
            Or,
as now, as floor. Now we look out the windows, go in &
            out the doors. The Door.
(That front door which was but & then at that time My door).
            I closed it
On the wooing of Helen. “And so we left schools for her.” For
She is not one bit fiction; & she is easy to see;
            & she leaves me small room
For contradiction. And she is not alone; & she is not one bit
            lonely in the large high room, &
invention is just vanity, which is plain. She
is the heart’s own body, the body’s own mind in itself
            self-contained.
& she talks like you; & she has created truly not single-handedly
Our tragic thing, America. And though I would be I am not afraid
            of her, & you also not. You, yourself, I,
Me, myself, me. And no, we certainly have not pulled down
            our vanity: but
We wear it lightly here,
                                       here where I traded evenly,
                                                                                    & even gladly
health, for sanity; here

                                                                             on the same spot.
My English friends, whom I love & miss, we talk to ourselves here,
            & we two
rarely fail to remember, although we write seldom, & so must seem
            gone forever.
In the stained sky over this morning the clouds seem about to burst
            What is being remembering
Is how we are, together. Like you we are always bothered, except
            by the worst; & we are living
            as with you we also were
fired, only, mostly, by changes in the weather. For Oh dear hearts,
When precious baby blows her fuse / it’s just our way
            of keeping amused.
That we offer of & as excuse. Here’s to you. All the very best.
            What’s your pleasure? Cheers."
492,Something Amazing Just Happened,Ted Berrigan,"for Jim Carroll, on his birthday

A lovely body gracefully is nodding
Out of a blue Buffalo
                                    Monday morning
                                                                 curls
softly rising color the air
                                         it’s yellow
above the black plane
                                    beneath a red tensor
 
I’ve been dreaming. The telephone kept ringing & ringing
Clear & direct, purposeful yet pleasant, still taking pleasure
in bringing the good news, a young man in horn-rims’ voice
                                                                                                   is speaking
while I listen. Mr. Berrigan, he says, & without waiting for an answer
            goes on,
I’m happy to be able to inform you that your request for
            a Guggenheim Foundation Grant
Has been favorably received by the committee, & approved. When
            would you like to leave?
 
Uh, not just yet, I said, uh, what exactly did I say with regards to
            leaving, in my application … I’m a little hazy at the moment.
 
Yes. Your project, as outlined in your application for a grant for the
            purpose
of giving Jim Carroll the best possible birthday present you could get
            him, through our Foundation, actually left the project, that is,
            how the monies
would be spent, up to us. You indicated, wisely, I think, that we knew
            more about what kind of project we would approve than you did,
            so we should
make one up for you, since all you wanted was money, to buy Jim a
            birthday gift.
 
Aha! I said. So, what’s up?
 
We have arranged for you and Jim to spend a year in London, in a
            flat off of King’s Row.
You will receive 250 pounds a month expenses, all travel expenses
            paid, & a clothing allowance of 25 pounds each per month.
            During the year,
At your leisure, you might send us from time to time copies of your
            London works. By year’s end I’m sure you each will have enough
            new poems for two books,
Which we would then publish in a deluxe boxed hardcover edition,
            for the rights to which we shall be prepared to pay a considerable
            sum, as is your due.
We feel that this inspired project will most surely result in The first
            major boxed set of works since Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry
            Finn! Innocents Abroad
in reverse, so to speak! We know your poems, yours & Jim’s, will tell it
            like it is, & that is what we are desperate to know! So, when
            would you like to leave?
Immediately, I shouted! & Jim! I called, Jim! Happy Birthday! Wake up!"
493,"44th Birthday Evening, at Harris’s",Ted Berrigan,"Nine stories high Second Avenue
On the roof there’s a party
All the friends are there watching
By the light of the moon the blazing sun
Go down over the side of the planet
To light up the underside of Earth
There are long bent telescopes for the friends
To watch this through. The friends are all in shadow.
I can see them from my bed inside my head.
44 years I’ve loved these dreams today.
17 years since I wrote for the first time a poem
On my birthday, why did I wait so long?

its highways go to many good places where
many good people were found; a home land, whose song comes up
from the throat of a hummingbird & it ends
where the sun goes to across the skies of blue.
I live there with you."
494,"After Peire Vidal, & Myself",Ted Berrigan,"for Shelley

Oh you, the sprightliest & most puggish, the brightest star
Of all my lively loves, all Ladies, & to whom once I gave up
My heart entire, thenceforth yours to keep forever
Locked up in your own heart’s tiniest room, my best hope, or
To throw away, carelessly, at your leisure, should that prove
Your best pleasure, Who is that dumpy matron, decked out in worn &
        faded
Shabby army fatigues which pooch out both before & behind, now
        screeching
Scoring me painfully in philistine Commedia dell’arte farce, low
        summer fare
Across a pedestrian Ferry’s stretch of water in some meshugganah Snug
        Harbor
And once more, even, fiercely pecking at me in the cold drab Parish
        Hall of
Manhattan’s Landmark Episcopal Church, where a once Avant-garde
        now Grade School
Poetry Project continues to dwell, St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bouwerie,
        whose
Stones hold in tight grip one wooden leg & all of Peter Stuyvesant’s
        bones?
 Who is that midget-witch who preens & prances as she flaunts her lost
        wares,
Otherwise hidden beneath some ancient boy’s flannel-shirt, its tail out
& flapping, & who
Is shrieking even now these mean words:
                                                            “Hey     Ted!”     “Hey, you Fat God!”
& called me, “Fickle!”         “Fickle!”
                                                                 & she points a long boney finger
at me, & croons, gleefully.
                                                        “Limbo!”     “That's where you really live!”
& She is claiming to be you
 
                                                as she whispers, viciously,
                                                                                                            “Alone, &
In Pain, In Limbo, is where you live     in your little cloud-9 home     Ted!
Pitiful!”
               She has a small purse, & removing it from one of her
        shopping bags
She brings out from inside that small purse, my withered heart; &
lifting it
high into the air over her head with her two hands, she turns it upside
        down
unzips its fasteners, & shakes it out over the plywood floor, happily.
        “Empty,”
she cries loudly, “just like I always knew it would be!” “Empty!”
        “Empty” “Empty”
  
I watch her, and think,
                                     That’s not really you, up there, is it,
                Rose?     Rochelle?     Shelley?
                                                                 O, don’t be sad, little Rose! It’s still
Your ribbon I wear, your favor tied to the grip of my lance, when I
        ride out to give battle,
                                                  these golden days."
495,Around the Fire,Ted Berrigan,"What I’m trying to say is that if an experience is
proposed to me—I don’t have any particular interest
in it—Any more than anything else. I’m interested in
anything. Like I could walk out the door right now and go some
where else. I don’t have any center in that sense. If you’ll look
in my palm you’ll see that my heart and my head line are
the same and if you’ll look in your palm you’ll see that it’s
different. My heart and my head feel exactly the same. Me,
I like to lay around of a Sunday and drink beer. I don’t feel
a necessity for being a mature person in this world. I mean
all the grown-ups in the world, they’re just playing house, all
poets know that. How does your head feel? How I feel is
what I think. I look at you today, & I expect you to look
the same tomorrow. If you’re having a nervous breakdown, I’m
not going to be looking at you like you’re going to die, because
I don’t think you are. If you’re a woman you put yourself
somewhere near the beginning and then there’s this other place
you put yourself in terms of everybody. “The great cosmetic strange-
ness of the normal deep person.” Okay. Those were those people—and
I kept telling myself, I have to be here, because I don’t have
a country. How tight is the string? And what is on this particular
segment of it? And the photographer, being black, and the writer,
me, being white, fell out at this point. And he didn’t want to
look at it—I mean it’s nothing, just some drunk Indians riding
Jersey milk cows—but I wanted to see it, I mean it was right
in front of my eyes and I wanted therefore to look at it.
And death is not any great thing, it’s there or it’s not. I mean
God is the progenitor of religious impetuousity in the human beast.
And Davy Crockett is right on that—I mean he’s gonna shoot a bear,
but he’s not gonna shoot a train, because the train is gonna run
right over him. You can’t shoot the train. And I always thought
there was another way to do that. And it is necessary to do that
and we bear witness that it is necessary to do it. The only distinction
between men and women is five million shits."
496,The Attic,Cynthia Huntington,"It’s September: I’ve moved into town,
into the attic of an old barn—a big open room I reach
by climbing a ladder that rises through a hole in the floor.
The room is long and high, with windows at each end,
a row of skylights that leak rain, and shake
and chatter in the northeast winds. I sleep beneath
the roof’s steep pitch, my mattress flat on the boards,
looking up at the high ceiling, where morning
diffuses downward in grains of bright dust.
  
This was the old painter’s studio.
The light in those famous canvases is still here
—he couldn’t carry it away with him—
though his paintings took away everything else,
opening space with a stroke of blue or yellow.
I think of his violent loves, the stories
they still tell about him here.
But how quiet and alive his paintings were,
how they quiver with the life not yet realized.
  
The town is quiet in September.
Sometimes I hear people talking in the street.
Last night someone said they were going to wait for Michael,
and a voice said that Michael had gone home.
I walk the narrow path down to the marsh.
Wind hard in the dunes. Rain as I’m returning,
cutting through twisting streets, past gardens bent
low with rain, their colors a wash of gold.
  
I feel the air surround my body, feel it move
between my legs and between each finger,
as I walk, not mastering space, but in it.
And when the clouds open, the sky
suddenly wide and high, no roof of leaves,
it seems there’s nowhere to go but into wind or water.
I climb the narrow stairs that keep turning,
twisting inward until they meet the ceiling,
which opens and I rise through the floor,
released into an openness I never learn to expect.
  
At the yellow table I sit and read
an interview with Picasso’s lover, Francoise Gilot,
the only one to leave him and have another life.
She says she was not destroyed by him, as the others were:
“Because I am of the stuff that cannot be destroyed.”
I felt something blow through me then.
Some devouring wind. Surely, then,
I am of the stuff that can be destroyed.
Haven’t I felt it? The breaking of all I was?
Don’t I sit and count my losses,
here in this room where all the life I knew has ended,
so bare with desire I seem to be eating sky?
  
That’s how it is here: I’m lonely, sad;
the wind blows along the roof and I can’t sleep.
Rain runs down the walls and streams across the floor,
leaving dirty puddles on the boards.
A yellow table and a cupboard painted blue,
three chairs that don't match, or even balance rightly,
a dented bucket, its metal reflecting darkly
what is, what cannot be taken away.
What’s beautiful here? The whole thing
is beauty, a clarity not in things
but around them, complete. And still,
  
I seem to remain, somehow, myself,
to remain at least something, at a loss
to know how much can be taken from me
and leave me only changed, not ruined,
alert in an emptiness so alive
I recognized it as my life. What would be left,
the shape of it then, this life? I said some beauty,
or radiance, an endless space I fall into
or am taken up by, a brightness that holds me,
gathers light in the center of empty space,
like a vision of the life I have not lived."

New York’s lovely weather
                                                    hurts my forehead

                                                   in praise of thee
                                                                               the? white dead

                 what? what time is it in New York            in these here alps
        City of lovely tender hate
                                                             and beauty making beautiful

                                    it’s very ritzy in fact

                                    here I stand I can’t stand

That reminds me of the time
I wrote that long piece about a gangster name of “Jr.”
O Harry James! had eyes to wander but lacked tongue to praise
                                                             so later peed under his art
                 paused only to lay a sneeze
                                                                                      on Jack Dempsey

                             That reminds me of I buzz

498,Curse Two: The Naming,Cynthia Huntington,"Katherine, Katherine, Katherine, Katherine.
Black hair, small cold eyes, whom you loved.
Cock-tease Katherine, chewer of souls.
The door blew open and she blew in, a ghoul.
Black air, small cold wind, taking everything.
Fish-eater Katherine, whose nails dig blood.
I’m going to call her pinch-cunt, pickle-lip,
piss-dribble, shit-smear, goat’s-meat breath.
I want to throw stones at her mother’s corpse,
send her children to name-change foster homes.
May the coat she is wearing burst into flames
and boil the flesh blistering off her bones.
May she be refused in both heaven and hell
and wander the earth forever without rest—
a hungry ghost clinging to the rocks and trees."

Put the spaghetti & meatballs into the orgy pasta
        bowl—There was mixed salt & pepper in the
“Tittie-tweak” pasta bowl—We drank some dago red
        from glazed girlie demi-tasse cups—after
which we engaged in heterosexual intercourse, mutual
        masturbation, fellatio, & cunnilingus. For
dessert we stared at a cupboard full of art critic
        friends, sgraffitoed into underglazes on vases. We did
have a very nice time."

Gombrich, Art and Illusion

WHAT do you remember? When I looked at
 his streaky glasses, I wanted
 to leave him. And before that? He stole those
 cherries for me at midnight. We were walking
 in the rain and I loved him.
 And before that? I saw him coming
 toward me that time at the picnic,
 edgy, foreign.
  
 But you loved him? He sat in his room with
 the shades drawn, brooding. But you
 loved him? He gave me
 a photo of himself at sixteen, diving
 from the pier. It was summer. His arms
 outstretched. And before that?
 His mother was combing his soft curls
 with her fingers and crying. Crying.
  
 Is that what he said? He put on the straw hat
 and raced me to the barn. What did he
 tell you? Here’s the dried rose, brown
 as tobacco. Here’s the letter that I tore
 and pasted. The book of blank pages
 with the velvet cover. But do you still
  
 love him? When I rub the nap
 backwards, the colors lift,
 bristle. What do you mean?
 Sometimes, when I’m all alone,
 I find myself stroking it."
501,Eating Babies,Chana Bloch,"1
  
 FAT
 is the soul of this flesh.
 Eat with your hands, slow, you will understand
 breasts, why everyone
 adores them—Rubens’ great custard nudes—why
 we can’t help sleeping with
 pillows.
  
 The old woman in the park pointed,
 Is it yours?
 Her gold eye-teeth gleamed.
  
 I bend down, taste the fluted
 nipples, the elbows, the pads
 of the feet. Nibble earlobes, dip
 my tongue in the salt fold
 of shoulder and throat.
  
 Even now he is changing,
 as if I were 
 licking him thin.

 HE SQUEEZES his eyes tight
 to hide
 and blink! he’s still here.
 It’s always a surprise.
  
 Safety-fat,
 angel-fat,
  
 steal it in mouthfuls,
 store it away
 where you save
  
 the face that you touched
 for the last time
 over and over,
 your eyes closed
  
 so it wouldn’t go away.

 WATCH HIM sleeping. Touch
 the pulse where
 the bones haven’t locked
 in his damp hair:
 the navel of dreams.
 His eyes open for a moment, underwater.
  
 His arms drift in the dark
 as your breath
 washes over him.
  
 Bite one cheek. Again.
 It’s your own
 life you lean over, greedy,
 going back for more."
502,Ghost,Cynthia Huntington,"At first you didn’t know me.
I was a shape moving rapidly, nervous
  
at the edge of your vision. A flat, high voice,
dark slash of hair across my cheekbone.
  
I made myself present, though never distinct.
Things I said that he repeated, a tone
  
you could hear, but never trace, in his voice.
Silence—followed by talk of other things.
  
When you would sit at your desk, I would creep
near you like a question. A thought would scurry
  
across the front of your mind. I’d be there,
ducking out of sight. You must have felt me
  
watching you, my small eyes fixed on your face,
the smile you wondered at, on the lips only.
  
The voice on the phone, quick and full of business.
All that you saw and heard and could not find
  
the center of, those days growing into years,
growing inside of you, out of reach, now with you
  
forever, in your house, in your garden, in corridors
of dream where I finally tell you my name."
503,Multiple Sclerosis,Cynthia Huntington,"For ten years I would not say the name.
I said: episode. Said: setback, incident,
exacerbation—anything but be specific
in the way this is specific, not a theory
or description, but a diagnosis.
I said: muscle, weakness, numbness, fatigue.
I said vertigo, neuritis, lesion, spasm.
Remission. Progression. Recurrence. Deficit.
  
But the name, the ugly sound of it, I refused.
There are two words. The last one means: scarring.
It means what grows hard, and cannot be repaired.
The first one means: repeating, or myriad,
consisting of many parts, increasing in number,
happening over and over, without end."
504,Blood Honey,Chana Bloch,"Apprehended and held without trial,
our friend was sentenced:
 brain tumor, malignant.
Condemned each day to wake
and remember.

Overnight, a wall sprang up around him,
leaving the rest of us
outside.

Death passed over us this time.
We’re still at large. We’re free
to get out of bed, start the coffee,
open the blinds.
The first of the human freedoms.

If he’s guilty
we must be guilty; we’re all made of
the same cup of dust—

It’s a blessing, isn’t it? To be able,
days at a time,
to forget what we are.

             *

These numbered days
have a concentrated sweetness
that’s pressed from us,
the dying man most of all.

Today we eat brunch at Chester’s,
poached egg on toast,
orange juice foaming in frosted glasses.

He remembers the summer he packed blood oranges,
stripped to the waist,
drinking the fresh-squeezed juice in the factory
straight from the tap.
He cups his left hand under his chin
as if to a faucet, laughing.

He is scooping sweetness from the belly of death
—honey from the lion’s carcass.

We sit with our friend
and brood on the riddle he sets before us:
 What is it, this blood honey?

          *

A shadow is eating the sun.
It can blind you
but he’s looking right at it,
he won't turn away.

Already his gaze is marked
by such hard looking,
though just now he asked,
plaintive as a child,
 Why won’t it go away?

Day after day breaks
and gives him
back to us
broken.

Soon the husk of his knowing
won’t know even that.

          *

A man lies alone in his body in a world
he can still desire.
 Another slice of pie? he asks.

As long as he’s hungry
he’s still one of us.
 Oh Lord, not yet.

He drums out a jazz beat on the bedrail
with his one good hand
when the words stumble.
 See? he says. I can trick the tumor.

He can still taste and see.
 The world is good.

He hauls himself up in bed,
squinting his one good eye at the kingdom
through a keyhole
that keeps getting smaller
and smaller.
 It is good. It is very good."
505,The Color Green,Chana Bloch,"Two floors up, at the corner of Hearst and Shattuck,
he’s clamped for good                                    
in an iron lung. When it’s time to eat
he nudges his head a sweaty mile
to the edge of the pillow. It takes a while.
 
His brilliant bloodshot light-blue eyes
steer me from cupboard to fridge:                     
he would like his chicken burrito
cut into bite-size pieces,                                            
a bent straw for his glass of water, please.                
 
How does the body live its only life
in a cage? I watch him compute the distance
from bar to bar, and squeeze
between them
with a violent compression, a fury of bursting free
that doesn’t last.                    
 
His will is a crowbar, angled to pry up                                             
the rooted intractable weight
of matter. I watch him slyly, I check out
the way he does it. He
does it. But pain in its absolute privacy                                  
weighs what it weighs.
 
I come here to study the soul, posing one question               
a dozen ways, most of them silent. 
“If I’m only a body,” he laughs,                       
“I’m up shit creek.” His laugh                         
a gritty eruption of rock, salt and breath.
 
Like me he writes poems                                             
but he does it letter by letter  
on a propped keyboard, the mouth-stick
wobbling between his teeth.
That kind of speed keeps a poet accountable.                         
He won’t ever say, “The grass is very green”
when it’s only green."
506,Flour and Ash,Chana Bloch,"“Make flour into dough,” she answers,
“and fire will turn it into food.
Ash is the final abstraction of matter.
You can just brush it away.”
 
She tacks a sheet of paper to the wall,
dips her hand in a palette of flour and ash,
applies the fine soft powders with a fingertip,
highlighting in chalk and graphite,
blending, blurring with her thumb.
Today she is working in seven shades of gray.
 
Outside the door, day lilies
in the high flush of summer-
about-to-be-fall. Her garden burns
red and yellow in the dry August air
and is not consumed.
 
Inside, on the studio wall, a heavy
particulate smoke
thickens and rises. Footsteps grime the snow.
The about-to-be-dead line up on the ramp
with their boxy suitcases,
ashen shoes.
 
When I get too close she yanks me back.
She hovers over her creation
though she too has a mind
to brush against that world
and wipe it out."
507,Autumn,Joan Mitchell,"The rusty leaves crunch and crackle, 
Blue haze hangs from the dimmed sky, 
The fields are matted with sun-tanned stalks — 
Wind rushes by. 

The last red berries hang from the thorn-tree, 
The last red leaves fall to the ground. 
Bleakness, through the trees and bushes, 
Comes without sound."
508,Chicken Little In Love,Eliza Griswold,"I’m through! I’m through!
she says and resays.
The years pass.
Her feathers gray.
Her eggs 
lay themselves
less frequently. 
The sky falls."
509,The Cricket and the Grasshopper,Dan Beachy-Quick,"The senseless leaf   in the fevered hand
Grows hot, near blood-heat, but never grows
Green. Weeks ago the dove’s last cooing strain
Settled silent in the nest to brood slow
Absence from song. The dropped leaf cools
On the uncut grass, supple still, still green,
Twining still these fingers as they listless pull
The tangle straight until the tangle tightens
And the hand is caught, another fallen leaf. 
The poetry of the earth never ceases 
Ceasing — one blade of grass denies belief
Until its mere thread bears the grasshopper’s
Whole weight, and the black cricket sings unseen,
Desire living in a hole beneath the tangle’s green."
510,Filicudi,Eliza Griswold,"You have a beautiful mouth,
Luigi, the man-boy says. 

The rubber raft
has floated far 
from shore. 

The choice
is this:

medusa sea,

a boil 
of   jellied lashes,

or 

face 
the kiss."
511,From “Romanticisms”,Dan Beachy-Quick,"Mortal oddment, there’s no wish in the blood
But beat, but stay gift-strong, but make demands
To keep within veins this ore’s diffuse gold,
These voices that know without being known —
These voices that riddle thought with herself,
Ridicule thought in her flimsy eternal
Gowns a child can tear in half   with a breath —
That chorus arterial, unbribable,
Blowing song through self as a child blows
A dandelion apart —
                                      All those weeds? —
Thistle’s down and thistle’s thorn, dumb yellow
Globes below that bind grass to their hollow creed,
Wind’s meager flute, sere song, the whole field’s late
Doom? Heart-blood? Voices, you? That’s my portrait? —

I kept repeating, repeating, kept re —
To repair, to repair my, or not my — the
Mind’s bower, but whose — who mines urgency —
Or whose mind regrets all those violets rooted
In violence — or I only mean thought, in thought,
Not violence, thinking, and the stupid leaf
Unfolding, mine, mine, mind. Here’s the plot
All untended: Psyche and, and — some thief
Unnamed — no, some unnamed leaf, and the sun,
Yes, only the sun that through open eyes
Turns the livid leaf green. Not leaf. Meant wound —
Or is it wind, is it wind that split in half   by
A gnat, by a blade of grass, always heals its gale —
What is the wound that is being healed, healed —"
512,How I Might Sound if I Left Myself Alone,Lisa Russ Spaar,"Turning to watch you leave,
I see we must always walk toward

other loves, river of   heaven
between two office buildings. 

Orphaned cloud, fish soup poppling,
book spined in the open palm. Unstoppable light.

I think it is all right.
Or do tonight, garden toad

a speaking stone,
young sound in an old heart.

Annul the self? I float it,
a day lily in my wine. Oblivion?

I love our lives,
keeping me from it."
513,The Last Time I Slept in This Bed,Sara Peters,"I was involved in the serious business
of ripping apart my own body.

I’d run my fingers over it,
seeking but never finding

the right point of entry,
so having to tear one myself,

though midway through
I’d always tire,

and let night enter
like a silver needle,

sewing my eyelids shut.
This was not an original practice,

but thinking, for a time, that it was
felt like being able to choose

when spring would arrive:
engineering an April

that opened like a parasol,
even in thoroughest winter."
514,Monstrance Man,Ricardo Pau-Llosa,"As a boy he had trouble speaking,
past three before a real word preened
from his lips. And for the longest time,
malaprops haunted him. His older sister
did what she could to train the bitten seal
of   his brain to twirl the red ball 
on the nose of eloquence, and his grandmother
tired of   insisting he utter the names
of   toys or foods — for every desire
was coded — and gave him whatever
he grunted and pointed to. 
O, the man then a boy
thought, when I tower among them
I should invent my own speech
and leave others empty and afraid
that they did not know it, could not ask
or plead their case in the one tongue
that mattered. I shall have them
look upon the simplest things,
the man then a boy thought, 
and fill up with stolen awe,
and point with their faces,
their pupils wide as blackened coins,
and hope with all the revenue
shattered heart-glass can muster
that someone had grasped
their need as need and not
as the monstrous coupling
of   sounds in a trance of whims.
Then, the grind of   his teeth
vowed, then the plazas of my city
will fill with my name,
and their blood will matter 
as little to them as to me."
515,The Orange Bottle,Joshua Mehigan,"The clear orange bottle was empty. 
It had been empty a day.
It suddenly seemed so costly
and uncalled for anyway.
  
Two years had passed. They had passed
more or less the way years should.
Maybe he’d changed. Or maybe
the doctors had misunderstood.
  
It was June. The enormous elm tree
was green again, and the scent
of   hyacinth reached through the window
and followed wherever he went.
  
And the sky was the firmament!
His life was never better.
Each small white spotless cloud that passed
was like a long-wished-for letter.
  
But then he remembered his promise.
It came like a mild cramp,
and it sat there all day in the back of   his mind
like a gas bill awaiting a stamp.
  
He saw three faces that Sunday,
mother, sister, niece,
all with the same kind, brown, scared eyes
that brought him no peace.
  
The sidewalk sparrows were peeping.
His whole house smelled like a flower.
But he remembered his promise.
The drugstore said one hour.
  
Back home again, he was tired.
The label said caution, said warning.
He left the clear orange bottle
on the lip of   the sink till morning.
  
The insert said warning, said caution.
The insert said constipation.
It said insomnia, vivid dreams,
and hypersalivation,
     and increased urination,
     and a spinning sensation.
  
It also said night sweats, and
agranulocytosis,
and strongly suggested a full glass of   water
be drunk with all doses.
  
The insert said all this,
the insert he never read.
But he didn’t have to read it
to know what it said.
  
The bedroom was calm with moonlight
and the breeze through the screen was cooling.
Through the elm leaves the shivery light on the wall
came like quicksilver pooling.

But   just before five, something woke him —
a close whisper — or maybe a far cry —
and the bedroom was queasy with light the color
of   lapis lazuli.

He lay there listening hard
till six, till seven, till eight    ...
At nine he remembered the bottle.
But nine, nine was too late. 

“Don’t take me!” cried the Clozapine.
“Don’t take me!” cried the pill. 
By ten he was feeling restless,
with a whole day left to kill.

“Don’t take me!” cried the Clozapine.
“Yes, don’t!” cried the medication. 
And the bright yellow morning seemed suddenly edged
with a shady fascination. 

Why should he go to his workplace?
Who was his supervisor?
He had a sickening feeling
that he was becoming wiser.

His room filled up with interest.
He had begun to think!
He thought of the knives in the kitchen
and the bottles under the sink.

He thought as he switched the stove on
or stood at his shaving mirror,
or reached for his belt in the wardrobe. 
Thinking made things clearer. 

Even the bedroom window,
the open window full of sun,
continually hinted
at something that should be done.

But he was crooked and useless.
 He was a piece of shit.
 And so, as everyone knew he would,
 he failed to go through with it.
  
 “Don’t take me!” cried the Clozapine.
 “Don’t take me!” cried the drug.
 Just then, the telephone rang.
 Just then, he ripped out the plug.
  
 “Don’t take me!” cried the Clozapine.
 “Don’t take me!” cried the poison.
 And the door of   the house creaked open,
 and the cellar door lilted and murmured,
 and the garden gate groaned and yawned
 and let a little noise in.
  
 There, just outside his window,
 lurked life like a cheap cartoon.
 He shut the sash, locked it, and checked it,
 and checked it all afternoon.
  
 He lowered the blinds on that world,
 no longer an agent of   it,
 but then, with one finger, pulled down a slat
 and set his eye above it.
  
At first it was grimly amusing,
at last it was grimly grim,
to watch all those hunched, hurried people,
who made like they weren’t watching him.
  
The neighbors were thinking out loud.
They knew he was no fucking good.
So he slumped on a stool in the corner
like a bad little snaggletooth should.
  
They called him a dirty pig, and laughed,
and said he shouldn’t exist.
Sometimes they made a tsking sound,
or oinked at him, or hissed.
  
They hissed that he was to blame
for everything, and everyone knew it,
and that if   he weren’t such a pussy
he’d know what to do, and he’d do it.
  
He lay on his side on the rug
 unable to move at all
except for his big right toe,
   which dug and dug at the wall,
      which dug at the wall,
             which dug.
  
“Don’t take me!” cried the Clozapine.
“Don’t take me!” cried the cure.
And they begged him to sew his mouth shut
just to make goddamn sure.
  
“Don’t take me!” cried the Clozapine.
“Don’t take me!” cried the poison.
And the gate to the wicked city gaped,
and the gates of the temple screamed and screamed,
and the gates of the garden groaned and yawned,
and the gates of the ziggurat gabbled in grief,
and sucked all life’s sorrows and joys in.
  
 His thoughts were advancing like wolves.
He lay still for an hour and a half,
then reared up onto his rickety legs
like a newborn calf.

Then     rug 
                         hall 
                                      stairs
porch 
             stoop 
                         street
and the blacktop humanly warm
on the soles of   his naked feet.

His walk was stiffened by fear, 
but it took him where he was going,
into the terrible world 
of children and daffodils growing,
       and friendly people helloing,
        and the Super out doing the mowing,
        and the two old sisters out in wool sweaters with their wrinkled
            cheeks pinkly glowing,
       and the pretty lady who would give birth by Christmas barely
          showing but showing,
       and the policeman helping to keep the lazy afternoon traffic  
          flowing,
       and time itself slowing,
       and none of them, none of them knowing

that an odious axis was forming,
that it would not be controlled,
that schemes were afoot, that a foot
was a thing for a jackboot to hold,

that the street was a movie set,
that it was not warm and sunny,
that a creditor was calling
who could not be paid with money, 

that the world was like a sliver
of   iron held in the hand,
and his mind the lodestone above it
that made it stir or stand,

that the air was slowly changing
to a color they didn’t know,
that he was a famous doctor
on a television show.

But what could he do? Even friends
would take these facts for lies,
and he couldn’t tell who the enemies were,
though he felt the hot breath of their eyes,

so he kept his big mouth shut 
and tried to play along,
and plowed down the street toward the coffeeshop
as if nothing at all were wrong.

He tried not to notice the numbers 
painted on garbage cans.
He tried and he tried not to look
at the black unmarked sedans.

The coffeeshop smelled like coffee,
but it felt different inside.
A new waitress went by. She winked. 
He kept his eyes open wide.

Everything screamed “Run away!”
But he wasn’t really there!
So he stood by the gumball machines
and smiled and tried not to stare.

“The power is yours!” said a T-shirt.
“Look for lightning!” reported the weather.
And the stranger who offered the Sports section said,
“It’s all there, Chief. Just put it together.”

Then wild-eyed out of the kitchen
stormed a small, hard old man,
shouting in a strange language
and waving a frying pan,

shoving him out the door
and into the chattering street,
shoving him, waving, shouting, 
and pointing at his feet,
    at his bare, gray feet.

Then came the dark blue uniform,
the badge glinting in the sun,
and the belt jangling like a storm trooper’s
as the boots broke into a run.

“Take that!” cried the patrolman.
“Take that!” cried Johnny Law.
Street, knee, neck —
cuffs, curb, jaw.

And the flatfoot pushed him, bleeding, 
into the sleek cruiser,
and he heard all the gawkers thinking
that he was a pig and a loser,

and his chin throbbed,
and the handcuffs ate at his wrist,
and he would be hacked into pieces soon
and would not be missed. 

“Don’t take me!” cried the victim.
“Don’t take me!” cried the threat.
But the angry back of a head
was the only response he could get.

Lying on his side like a child 
at the end of a big day,
he gazed up through the window
and watched it all slip away.

The little pen where they put him
had a toilet but no stall.
Here and there a message
scarred the gloss-white wall.

Time passed. But you couldn’t tell it
on the trapped fly ticking the ceiling,
or the flickering light overhead,
or the sore on his chin congealing,
      or on the sound of the other pigs in the other pens, squealing.

When the men came, he was ready.
He talked. They took it all down.
And soon they were back in the cruiser,
on their way across town.

Then, into the mirrored building,
over the waxed lobby floors,
down miles of echoing hallways,
through the heavy brown doors,

into a humming beige room
with a bed and a river view,
and an outside lock, and jailers
who wore white instead of blue.

“Take that,” smiled the doctor. 
“Take that,” smiled the nurse. 
He pressed his lips still tighter,
and things got worse and worse.

“Please!” threatened the nurse.
“Please!” growled the doctor.
He raised his fists to cover his mouth,
but the nurse was too close, and he clocked her.

Now into the room came the big men,
who did not clamor or shout,
but pinned him with ease to the bed,
strapped him down, and went out.

And the doctor was there again, trailing
a spider web of cologne,
and the doctor told what would happen next,
in an expert monotone,

and the nurse took a needle
and emptied it into his arm,
and they both left, content 
that he could do no more harm,

and he fought, and the straps cut his shoulders, 
and he gnawed at his lip, and it bled,
and he held his bladder for three long hours,
then shivered and pissed the bed.

When the doctor came a fifth time,
it was long past dawn.
They’d found him a room, said the doctor,
gently restraining a yawn.

The next two days were sleep, 
and words through a fine white mist.
Then he woke inside a machine
whose motion he couldn’t resist:

       “Tick-tock,” said the clock. 
       “Creak, creak,” said the bed.
       “Drip, drip,” said the sink.
        “Throb, throb,” went his head.
       “Ho-hum,” sighed the night nurse. 
        “Heh-heh,” said the sicko.
       “Why? Why?” screamed the patient.
       “Howl, howl!” cried the psycho. 
       “Wolf! Wolf!” cried the boy. 
       “Gobble, gobble!” sang the freaks. 
       “Sa, sa!” cried the king.
       “Tick-tock,” went the weeks.
       “Bang, bang,” said the tv.
       “Teeter-totter,” went his brain.
       “Click, click,” went the checkers.
       “Pitter-patter,” went the rain.
        “Bring-bring,” said the pay phone. 
        “Snip, snip,” went Fate.
        “Jangle-jingle,” went the keys.
        “Clank-clink,” went the gate.
        “Bye-bye,” said the nurse.
        “Bye-bye,” said the guard.
        “Bar-bar,” said the doctor.
        “Baa-baa,” said the lamb. 
        “My, my,” said his mother. 
        “Boohoo!” cried Bo Peep. 
        “Bow-wow,” said the wolf.
        “Baa-baa,” said the sheep.

In the car away from that place, 
the family had a pleasant chat.
He seemed fine again, and humble, 
though his speech was oddly flat.

He said that the halfway house
where he would be residing
was located on a quiet block and had
green vinyl siding.

There he met new people
and watched the television,
which did not watch him back
or speak to him with derision,

and he performed certain tasks,
meant to teach certain skills,
and he got small checks from the government
to pay his enormous bills.

Each night he fell asleep, 
and each morning he got up,
and he washed down his medicine
and squashed the paper cup, 

feeling, in all, much better, 
more in touch with common sense, 
and also slightly bored
by the lack of consequence.

And the church bells rang
and a dinner bell tinkled
and the school bell tolled
and called all the good girls and boys in.
And all of them brought all their toys in.
And all of them swallowed their poison."
516,Rehearsal,Sara Peters,"I am walking through water with one of my sisters,
               the river banked with tiger lilies, the sun
like having a lemon juiced into your eye, our senile dog

ecstatic behind us,
               and I am yammering
about my discovery —

a chest deep pool, sentried by trees
               that caterpillars were killing
with their yearly carnival tents.

We reach then ruin the pool with oils and shampoos.
               We scrub too much skin
from our heels, then debate

whether to sunbathe naked:
               that is, who is hiding in the woods.
We joke so long and rough

the joke morphs, till we’re practicing for
               our future rapes:
we both have numbers that we know are up.

My sister’s ears are speared
               with porcupine quills and steel,
but she’s placed her straw hat carefully over her stomach.

As she talks I watch
               while dragonflies and other
less showy insects land

on her burning shoulders.
               The dragonflies present their stenciled wings.
I can’t remember what the others do. 

My sister spits
               to clean each sunglass mirror.
 She wants me to hear
  
 how, when it happens,
               she’ll do this scream —
 but when the scream comes it’s just like she’s opened
  
 a shaken bottle of sparkling water:
               I am speechless only for the view
 of   her throat’s cushioned corridor.
  
 But when the scream ends her eyes
               have broken off from the rest of   her face.
 She takes our green net bag full of oranges,
  
 and slams it down on the baking rocks,
               beating the ground till the oranges soften
 and streak the air with the smell of   their breaking."
517,Sapphic Fragment,Eliza Griswold,"Do I still long for my virginity?— Fragment 107

I never longed for my virginity.
I heard it on the radio after the hurricane. 

There, in the aftermath, was the voice of a man —
once the sweet, screwed-up boy whose hooded, 

jessed spirit I tried to possess with the ruthlessness 
I mistook for power. Here he was on NPR, 

so gentle, so familiar with devastation, 
his timbre woke the teenage falconer in me 

who once saw his kindness as weakness, 
saw a boy as an unfledged goshawk —

a creature to trap and be trapped with
in darkened mews. I knew the rules: 

neither of us could sleep until the molting bird 
grew ravenous enough to take the raw mouse 

from my hand. Breaking the falcon
broke us both, left us scared 

and less aware of  love than fear."
518,Temple On My Knees,Lisa Russ Spaar,"When this day returns to me
I will value your heart, 
long hurt in long division,
over mine. Mouth above mine too —
say you love me, truth never more
meant, say you are angry.
Words, words we net with our mouths.
Soul is an old thirst but not as first
as the body’s perhaps,
though on bad nights its melancholy
eats us out, to a person.
True, time is undigressing.
Yet true is all we can be:
rhyming you, rhyming me."
519,Temple You,Lisa Russ Spaar,"What is mysterious about loss, 
flush of arm pulled from a wilted sleeve,

summer’s urine-tang in autumn leaves?
Let   John Keats light another fag.

Or Brontë refuse the doctor
on her black sateen settee.

For whatever part of   you 
may be taken away, you said,

is the scar I will visit first
with my mouth, each time, 

as gold visits the thieved till, 
sun the obliterated sill, 

saying praise you for leaving
me this you, this living still."
520,"I Dug, Beneath the Cypress Shade",Thomas Love Peacock,"I dug, beneath the cypress shade,
    What well might seem an elfin's grave;
And every pledge in earth I laid,
    That erst thy false affection gave.

I pressed them down the sod beneath;
    I placed one mossy stone above;
And twined the rose's fading wreath
    Around the sepulchre of love.

Frail as thy love, the flowers were dead,
    Ere yet the evening sun was set:
But years shall see the cypress spread,
    Immutable as my regret."
521,Seamen Three,Thomas Love Peacock,"Seamen three! What men be ye?
Gotham's three wise men we be.
Whither in your bowl so free?
To rake the moon from out the sea.
The bowl goes trim. The moon doth shine.
And our ballast is old wine;
And your ballast is old wine.

Who art thou, so fast adrift?
I am he they call Old Care.
Here on board we will thee lift.
No: I may not enter there.
Wherefore so? 'Tis Jove's decree,
In a bowl Care may not be;
In a bowl Care may not be.

Fear ye not the waves that roll?
No: in charmed bowl we swim.
What the charm that floats the bowl?
Water may not pass the brim.
The bowl goes trim. The moon doth shine.
And our ballast is old wine;
And your ballast is old wine."
522,The War-song of Dinas Vawr,Thomas Love Peacock,"The mountain sheep are sweeter,
But the valley sheep are fatter;
We therefore deemed it meeter
To carry off the latter.
We made an expedition;
We met a host, and quelled it;
We forced a strong position,
And killed the men who held it.

On Dyfed's richest valley,
Where herds of kine were browsing,
We made a mighty sally,
To furnish our carousing.
Fierce warriors rushed to meet us;
We met them, and o'erthrew them:
They struggled hard to beat us;
But we conquered them, and slew them.

As we drove our prize at leisure,
The king marched forth to catch us:
His rage surpassed all measure,
But his people could not match us.
He fled to his hall-pillars;
And, ere our force we led off,
Some sacked his house and cellars,
While others cut his head off.

We there, in strife bewild'ring,
Spilt blood enough to swim in:
We orphaned many children,
And widowed many women.
The eagles and the ravens
We glutted with our foemen;
The heroes and the cravens,
The spearmen and the bowmen.

We brought away from battle,
And much their land bemoaned them,
Two thousand head of cattle,
And the head of him who owned them:
Ednyfed, king of Dyfed,
His head was borne before us;
His wine and beasts supplied our feasts,
And his overthrow, our chorus."
523,Back Road,Bruce Guernsey,"Winter mornings
driving past
I’d see these kids
huddled like grouse
in the plowed ruts
in front of their shack
waiting for the bus,
three small children
bunched against the drifts
rising behind them.

This morning
I slowed to wave
and the smallest,
a stick of a kid
draped in a coat,
grinned and raised
his red, raw hand,
the snowball
packed with rock
aimed at my face."
524,Burning the Book,Ron Koertge,"The anthology of love poems I bought
for a quarter is brittle, anyway, and comes
apart when I read it.

One at a time, I throw pages on the fire
and watch smoke make its way up
and out.

I’m almost to the index when I hear
a murmuring in the street. My neighbors
are watching it snow.

I put on my blue jacket and join them.
The children stand with their mouths
open.
 
  I can see nouns—longing, rapture, bliss— 
land on every tongue, then disappear."
525,Cement Backyard,Lynne Sharon Schwartz,"My father had our yard cemented over.
He couldn’t tell a flower from a weed.
The neighbors let their backyards run to clover
and some grew dappled gardens from a seed,

but he preferred cement to rampant green.
Lushness reeked of anarchy’s profusion.
Better to tamp the wildness down, unseen,
than tolerate its careless brash intrusion.

The grass interred, he felt well satisfied:
his first house, and he took an owner’s pride,
surveying the uniform, cemented yard.
Just so, he labored to cement his heart."
526,"The Cranes, Texas January",Mark Sanders,"I call my wife outdoors to have her listen,
to turn her ears upward, beyond the cloud-veiled
sky where the moon dances thin light,
to tell her, “Don’t hear the cars on the freeway—

it’s not the truck-rumble. It is and is not
the sirens.” She stands there, on deck
a rocking boat, wanting to please the captain
who would have her hear the inaudible.

Her eyes, so blue the day sky is envious,
fix blackly on me, her mouth poised on question
like a stone. But, she hears, after all.
                                                           January on the Gulf,  
warm wind washing over us, 
we stand chilled in the winter of those voices."
527,Kites,Robert Gibb,"Come March we’d find them 
In the five-and-dimes, 
Furled tighter than umbrellas 
About their slats, the air

In an undertow above us
Like weather on the maps. 
We’d play out lines
Of kite string, tugging against

The bucking sideways flights. 
Readied for assembly,
I’d arc the tensed keel of balsa 
Into place against the crosspiece,

Feeling the paper snap 
 Tautly as a sheet, then lift
 The almost weightless body 
Up to where it hauled me

Trolling into the winds— 
Knotted bows like vertebrae 
Flashing among fields
Of light. Why ruin it

By recalling the aftermaths? 
Kites gone down in tatters, 
Kites fraying like flotsam 
From the tops of the trees."
528,Living Tree,Robert Morgan,"It’s said they planted trees by graves
to soak up spirits of the dead
through roots into the growing wood.
The favorite in the burial yards
I knew was common juniper.
One could do worse than pass into
such a species. I like to think
that when I’m gone the chemicals
and yes the spirit that was me
might be searched out by subtle roots
and raised with sap through capillaries
into an upright, fragrant trunk,
and aromatic twigs and bark,
through needles bright as hoarfrost to
the sunlight for a century
or more, in wood repelling rot
and standing tall with monuments
and statues there on the far hill,
erect as truth, a testimony,
in ground that’s dignified by loss,
around a melancholy tree
that’s pointing toward infinity."
529,Mailboxes in Late Winter,Jeffrey Harrison,"It’s a motley lot. A few still stand
at attention like sentries at the ends
of their driveways, but more lean
askance as if they’d just received a blow
to the head, and in fact they’ve received
many, all winter, from jets of wet snow
shooting off the curved, tapered blade
of the plow. Some look wobbly, cocked
at oddball angles or slumping forlornly
on precariously listing posts. One box
bows steeply forward, as if in disgrace, its door
lolling sideways, unhinged. Others are dented,
battered, streaked with rust, bandaged in duct tape,
crisscrossed with clothesline or bungee cords.
A few lie abashed in remnants of the very snow
that knocked them from their perches.
Another is wedged in the crook of a tree
like a birdhouse, its post shattered nearby.
I almost feel sorry for them, worn out
by the long winter, off-kilter, not knowing
what hit them, trying to hold themselves
together, as they wait for news from spring."
530,Portraits,Mark Irwin,"Mother came to visit today. We
hadn’t seen each other in years. Why didn’t
you call? I asked. Your windows are filthy, she said. I know,
I know. It’s from the dust and rain. She stood outside.
I stood in, and we cleaned each one that way, staring into each other’s eyes,
rubbing the white towel over our faces, rubbing
away hours, years. This is what it was like
when you were inside me, she said. What? I asked,
though I understood. Afterwards, indoors, she smelled like snow
melting. Holding hands we stood by the picture window,
gazing into the December sun, watching the pines in flame."
531,Envoy,Lisa Robertson,"I have tried to say
that, although Love is not judgement
analysis too is a style
of affect
since the scale that rends me vulnerable
has cut, from abundance, doubt
(not that identity shunts
civic ratio or consequence) Sure —
I would prefer to respond to only
the established charms (and forget inconvenience)
but her hair was also a kind of honey
or instrument.
 
All that is beautiful, from which I choose
even artifice, which I hold above nature
won’t salve these stuttered accoutrements"
532,How to Judge,Lisa Robertson,"To those whose city is taken give glass
pockets. To those whose quiver gapes give queens
and pace their limbs with flutes, ropes, cups of soft
juice. To those whose threshold vacillates give
that bruise the dust astonished. To falling
heroes give raucous sibyls’ polished knees.
To those who sip nectar give teeth. And if
they still sip nectar—give green chips of wood.
To swimmers give clocks or rank their hearts
among new satellites as you would
Garbo’s skint lip. To scholars, give dovecotes
to virgins, targets. Justice has nothing on them.
Virgil, sweetheart, even pretty fops need
justice. If they think not let creditors
flank them and watch their vigour quickly flag.
To exiled brides give tiny knives and beads
of mercury then rob them of prudence
for prudence is defunct. To those who fist
clouds, give powder. And if their sullen
wallets flap, give nothing at all. Still
I have not addressed lambent fops
swathed in honey, the stuttering moon
Martyrs, Spartans, Sirens, Mumblers, Pawns
Ventriloquists—or your sweet ego
 
The Beloved Ego in the plummy light
is you. When I see you in that light
I desire all that has been kept from me
 etcetera. For you. Since your rough shirt
reminds me of the first grass
pressing my hips and seeds heads
fringing the sky and the sky
swaying lightly to your scraped
breath, since I hear
panicked, my sister calling
since the gold leaves have all
been lost, and you are at least
several and variegated
I toss this slight thread back
 
The beloved ego on cold marble
blurs inscription. Hey Virgil
I think your clocked ardour is stuck
in the blue vein on my wrist. It stops
all judgement"
533,II [What is this tint that in the shrill cress],Lisa Robertson,"What is this tint that in the shrill cress
Will never cease to trouble us and in the fields
Gives prick and praise for Beauty?
And said birds that feed on berries
Are pervious—and shook the snow from his thighs.
I thought of nothing carefully, but of snow, and the birds.
Then kissed the cup and sipped a little
Though almost choked drank slowly
Tickled with strange measure
She faked a pretty anger
I entertained the night with fantastic, empty pleasure
We went as far as the ivie-bush
And ivie-crowns upon our heads
And carried her kiss untouched and entire
Then all was fresh, inclined
To wriggle and nussle and lascivious
Ardent leaps. In the thickest of the wood
Bid him kiss close and often
And directed him to her fancie
The ground had a sweeter scent, the boughs a blush
One fruit, rare and rich, would outdo many together
She was wild to climb the tree
Nor would she be forbidden
She seized the apple and put it in her bosom."
534,[It was Jessica Grim the American poet...],Lisa Robertson,"It was Jessica Grim the American poet
who first advised me to read Violette Leduc.
Lurid conditions are facts. This is no different
from the daily protests and cashbars.
I now unknowingly speed towards
which of all acts, words, conditions —
I am troubled that I do not know.
When I feel depressed in broad daylight
depressed by the disappearance of names, the pollen
smearing the windowsill, I picture
the bending pages of La Bâtarde
and I think of wind. The outspread world is
comparable to a large theatre
or to rending paper, and the noise it makes when it flaps
is riotous. Clothes swish through the air, rubbing
my ears. Promptly I am quenched. I’m talking
about a cheap paperback which fans and
slips to the floor with a shush. Skirt stretched
taut between new knees, head turned back, I
hold down a branch,"
535,Monday,Lisa Robertson,"First all belief is paradise. So pliable a medium. A time not very long. A transparency caused. A conveyance of rupture. A subtle transport. Scant and rare. Deep in the opulent morning, blissful regions, hard and slender. Scarce and scant. Quotidian and temperate. Begin afresh in the realms of the atmosphere, that encompasses the solid earth, the terraqueous globe that soars and sings, elevated and flimsy. Bright and hot. Flesh and hue. Our skies are inventions, durations, discoveries, quotas, forgeries, fine and grand. Fine and grand. Fresh and bright. Heavenly and bright. The day pours out space, a light red roominess, bright and fresh. Bright and oft. Bright and fresh. Sparkling and wet. Clamour and tint. We range the spacious fields, a battlement trick and fast. Bright and silver. Ribbons and failings. To and fro. Fine and grand. The sky is complicated and flawed and we’re up there in it, floating near the apricot frill, the bias swoop, near the sullen bloated part that dissolves to silver the next instant bronze but nothing that meaningful, a breach of greeny-blue, a syllable, we’re all across the swathe of fleece laid out, the fraying rope, the copper beech behind the aluminum catalpa that has saved the entire spring for this flight, the tops of these a part of the sky, the light wind flipping up the white undersides of leaves, heaven afresh, the brushed part behind, the tumbling. So to the heavenly rustling. Just stiff with ambition we range the spacious trees in earnest desire sure and dear. Brisk and west. Streaky and massed. Changing and appearing. First and last. This was made from Europe, formed from Europe, rant and roar. Fine and grand. Fresh and bright. Crested and turbid. Silver and bright. This was spoken as it came to us, to celebrate and tint, distinct and designed. Sure and dear. Fully designed. Dear afresh. So free to the showing. What we praise we believe, we fully believe. Very fine. Belief thin and pure and clear to the title. Very beautiful. Belief lovely and elegant and fair for the footing. Very brisk. Belief lively and quick and strong by the bursting. Very bright. Belief clear and witty and famous in impulse. Very stormy. Belief violent and open and raging from privation. Very fine. Belief intransigent after pursuit. Very hot. Belief lustful and eager and curious before beauty.Very bright. Belief intending afresh. So calmly and clearly. Just stiff with leaf sure and dear and appearing and last. With lust clear and scarce and appearing and last and afresh."
536,América,Richard Blanco,"I.
Although Tía Miriam boasted she discovered
at least half a dozen uses for peanut butter—
topping for guava shells in syrup,
butter substitute for Cuban toast,
hair conditioner and relaxer—
 Mamá never knew what to make
of the monthly five-pound jars
handed out by the immigration department
until my friend, Jeff, mentioned jelly.
 
 
II.
There was always pork though,
for every birthday and wedding,
whole ones on Christmas and New Year’s Eve,
even on Thanksgiving day—pork,
fried, broiled, or crispy skin roasted—
as well as cauldrons of black beans,
fried plantain chips, and yuca con mojito.
These items required a special visit
to Antonio’s Mercado on the corner of Eighth Street
where men in guayaberas stood in senate
blaming Kennedy for everything—“Ese hijo de puta!”
the bile of Cuban coffee and cigar residue
filling the creases of their wrinkled lips;
clinging to one another’s lies of lost wealth,
ashamed and empty as hollow trees.
 
III.
By seven I had grown suspicious—we were still here.
Overheard conversations about returning
had grown wistful and less frequent.
I spoke English; my parents didn’t.
We didn’t live in a two-story house
with a maid or a wood-panel station wagon
nor vacation camping in Colorado.
None of the girls had hair of gold;
none of my brothers or cousins
were named Greg, Peter, or Marcia;
we were not the Brady Bunch.
None of the black and white characters
on Donna Reed or on the Dick Van Dyke Show
were named Guadalupe, Lázaro, or Mercedes.
Patty Duke’s family wasn’t like us either—
they didn’t have pork on Thanksgiving,
they ate turkey with cranberry sauce;
they didn’t have yuca, they had yams
like the dittos of Pilgrims I colored in class.
 
IV.
  A week before Thanksgiving
I explained to my abuelita
about the Indians and the Mayflower,
how Lincoln set the slaves free;
I explained to my parents about
the purple mountain’s majesty,
“one if by land, two if by sea,”
the cherry tree, the tea party,
the amber waves of grain,
the “masses yearning to be free,”
liberty and justice for all, until
finally they agreed:
this Thanksgiving we would have turkey,
as well as pork.
 
 
V.
 Abuelita prepared the poor fowl
as if committing an act of treason,
faking her enthusiasm for my sake.
 Mamá set a frozen pumpkin pie in the oven
and prepared candied yams following instructions
I translated from the marshmallow bag.
The table was arrayed with gladiolas,
the plattered turkey loomed at the center
on plastic silver from Woolworth’s.
Everyone sat in green velvet chairs
we had upholstered with clear vinyl,
except Tío Carlos and Toti, seated
in the folding chairs from the Salvation Army.
I uttered a bilingual blessing
and the turkey was passed around
like a game of Russian Roulette.
“DRY,” Tío Berto complained, and proceeded
to drown the lean slices with pork fat drippings
and cranberry jelly—“esa mierda roja,” he called it.
Faces fell when Mamá presented her ochre pie—
pumpkin was a home remedy for ulcers, not a dessert.
Tía María made three rounds of Cuban coffee
then Abuelo and Pepe cleared the living room furniture,
put on a Celia Cruz LP and the entire family
began to merengue over the linoleum of our apartment,
sweating rum and coffee until they remembered—
it was 1970 and 46 degrees—
in América.
After repositioning the furniture,
an appropriate darkness filled the room.
Tío Berto was the last to leave."
537,Burning in the Rain,Richard Blanco,"Someday compassion would demand
I set myself free of my desire to recreate
my father, indulge in my mother’s losses,
strangle lovers with words, forcing them
to confess for me and take the blame.
Today was that day: I tossed them, sheet
by sheet on the patio and gathered them
into a pyre. I wanted to let them go
in a blaze, tiny white dwarfs imploding
beside the azaleas and ficus bushes,
let them crackle, burst like winged seeds,
let them smolder into gossamer embers—
a thousand gray butterflies in the wind.
Today was that day, but it rained, kept
raining. Instead of fire, water—drops
knocking on doors, wetting windows
into mirrors reflecting me in the oaks.
The garden walls and stones swelling
into ghostlier shades of themselves,
the wind chimes giggling in the storm,
a coffee cup left overflowing with rain.
Instead of burning, my pages turned
into water lilies floating over puddles,
then tiny white cliffs as the sun set,
finally drying all night under the moon
into papier-mâché souvenirs. Today
the rain would not let their lives burn."
538,El Florida Room,Richard Blanco,"Not a study or a den, but El Florida
as my mother called it, a pretty name
for the room with the prettiest view
of the lipstick-red hibiscus puckered up
against the windows, the tepid breeze
laden with the brown-sugar scent
of loquats drifting in from the yard.

Not a sunroom, but where the sun
both rose and set, all day the shadows
of banana trees fan-dancing across
the floor, and if it rained, it rained
the loudest, like marbles plunking
across the roof under constant threat
of coconuts ready to fall from the sky.

Not a sitting room, but El Florida, where
I sat alone for hours with butterflies
frozen on the polyester curtains
and faces of Lladró figurines: sad angels,
clowns, and princesses with eyes glazed
blue and gray, gazing from behind
the glass doors of the wall cabinet.

Not a TV room, but where I watched
 Creature Feature as a boy, clinging
to my brother, safe from vampires
in the same sofa where I fell in love
with Clint Eastwood and my Abuelo
watching westerns, or pitying women
crying in telenovelas with my Abuela.

Not a family room, but the room where
my father twirled his hair while listening
to eight-tracks of Elvis, read Nietzsche
and Kant a few months before he died,
where my mother learned to dance alone
as she swept, and I learned salsa pressed
against my Tía Julia’s enormous breasts.

At the edge of the city, in the company
of crickets, beside the empty clothesline,
telephone wires, and the moon, tonight
my life is an old friend sitting with me
not in the living room, but in the light
of El Florida, as quiet and necessary
as any star shining above it."
539,The Island Within,Richard Blanco,"for Ruth Behar

I’m still thinking about your porch light
like a full moon casting a foggy halo
in the frigid air last night, the bare oaks
branching into the sky like nerve endings
inches away from the frozen stars,
the pink gables of your Victorian home
protesting yet another winter for you
captive in Ann Arbor as you practice
mambo by the fireplace. I’m following
your red-velvet shoes to conga beats
and bongo taps taking your body, but
not your life, from the snow mantling
your windows outside, 1,600 miles
away from Cuba. I’m tasting the cafecito
you made, the slice of homemade flan
floating in burnt sugar like the stories
you told me you can’t finish writing,
no matter how many times you travel
through time back to Havana to steal
every memory ever stolen from you.

You’re a thief anyone would forgive,
wanting only to imagine faces for names
chiseled on the graves of your family
at Guanabacoa, walk on Calle Aguacate
and pretend to meet the grandfather
you never met at his lace shop for lunch,
or pray the Kaddish like your mother
at the synagogue in El Vedado, stand
on the steps there like you once did
in a photo you can’t remember taking.
I confess I pitied you, still trying to reach
that unreachable island within the island
you still call home. I thought I was done
with Cuba, tired of filling in the blanks,
but now I’m not sure. Maybe if I return
just once more, walk the sugarcane fields
my father once cut, drive down the road
where my mother once peddled guavas
to pay for textbooks, sit on the porch
of my grandmother’s house, imagine her
still in the kitchen making arroz-con-leche—
maybe then I’ll have an answer for you
last night when you asked me: Would you
 move to Cuba? Would you die there?"
540,Since Unfinished,Richard Blanco,"I’ve been writing this since
the summer my grandfather
taught me how to hold a blade
of grass between my thumbs
and make it whistle, since
I first learned to make green
from blue and yellow, turned
paper into snowflakes, believed
a seashell echoed the sea,
and the sea had no end.
 
I’ve been writing this since
a sparrow flew into my class
and crashed into the window,
laid to rest on a bed of tissue
in a shoebox by the swings, since
the morning I first stood up
on the bathroom sink to watch
my father shave, since our eyes
met in that foggy mirror, since
the splinter my mother pulled
from my thumb, kissed my blood.
 
I’ve been writing this since
the woman I slept with the night
of my father’s wake, since
my grandmother first called me
a faggot and I said nothing, since
I forgave her and my body
pressed hard against Michael
on the dance floor at Twist, since
the years spent with a martini
and men I knew I couldn’t love.
 
I’ve been writing this since
the night I pulled off the road
at Big Sur and my eyes caught
the insanity of the stars, since
the months by the kitchen window
watching the snow come down
like fallout from a despair I had
no word for, since I stopped
searching for a name and found
myself tick-tock in a hammock
asking nothing of the sky.
 
I’ve been writing this since
spring, studying the tiny leaves
on the oaks dithering like moths,
contrast to the eon-old fieldstones
unveiled of snow, but forever
works-in-progress, since tonight
with the battled moon behind
the branches spying on the world—
same as it ever was—perfectly
unfinished, my glasses and pen
at rest again on the night table.
 
I’ve been writing this since
my eyes started seeing less,
my knees aching more, since
I began picking up twigs, feathers,
and pretty rocks for no reason
collecting on the porch where
I sit to read and watch the sunset
like my grandfather did everyday,
remembering him and how
to make a blade of grass whistle."
541,"It Was Alive, Though Differently",Hannah Gamble,"It had a secret name
which in later years came to mean
 I will continue to stand here.
  
It had a food mouth
and a shrieking mouth.
 
Popular wisdom indicated
that Its hands could heat stones
and that a man could cook
meat on those stones.
 
That being said,
It had a poverty hand
and a riches hand.
 
They were
the same hand.
 
A little ways above the hands
the mouths spoke together
but for two
different reasons,
like the music was behaving
but the orchestra was broken.
 
*
 
Even in less
benevolent moments,
It was known to use Its own
body as a tent and as the gifts
inside of the tent.
 
Early people said It had a mother hand
and a father hand, and that together
they made a clapping sound.
 
Its hands delivered the children
from madness.
 
The hands saw the riverbank sliding
into the river
to make
a more shallow river.
 
They scooped the mud up.
The hands were giving thanks.
 
*
 
The hands smelled like exodus.
The hands were the law.
 
One hand grew older, and the other
hand younger.
 
They said, fairly often,
 We’d like to try that again.
  
Both were restless
and wanted rest.
  
One hand said, I will go where you go,
while the other hand continued
on alone."
542,"Leisure, Hannah, Does Not Agree with You (2)",Hannah Gamble,"—After Catullus

My house disgusted me, so I slept in a tent.
My tent disgusted me, so I slept in the grass. The grass disgusted me,
so I slept in my body, which I strung like a hammock from two ropes.
My body disgusted me, so I carved myself out of it.
 
My use of knives disgusted me because it was an act of violence.
My weakness disgusted me because “Hannah” means “hammer.”
The meaning of my name disgusted me because I’d rather be known
as beautiful. My vanity disgusted me because I am a scholar.
 
My scholarship disgusted me because knowledge is empty.
My emptiness disgusted me because I wanted to be whole.
My wholeness would have disgusted me because to be whole
is to be smug. Still, I tried to understand wholeness
 
as the inclusiveness of all activities: I walked out into the yard,
trying to vomit and drink milk simultaneously. I tried to sleep
while smoking a cigar. I have enough regrets to crack all the plumbing.
I’m whole only in that I’ve built my person from every thought I’ve ever loved."
543,Your Invitation to a Modest Breakfast,Hannah Gamble,"It’s too cold to smoke outside, but if you come over,
I’ll keep my hands to myself, or won’t I.
I would like to tell you about the wall eaten up
 
by the climbing plant—it was so beautiful.
Various things have been happening to me,
all of them sexual. The man on the bus
 
took off his pants so I could see him better.
Another man said, “Ignore him darlin’.
Just sit on my lap.” But I’m not one of those
 
who’s hungriest in the morning,
unlike the man at the bakery
who eats egg after egg after egg.
 
Listen. Come over: the cold has already eaten
the summer. I need another pair of ears:
from the kitchen I can’t tell if I’m hearing wind chimes
 
or some gray woman with failing arms
dropping a pan full of onions and potatoes.
                                    This morning I need four hands—
 
two to wash the greens, one to lift a teakettle,
one to pour the milk. This morning, one little mouth
will not do. We could play a game
 
where we crouch on the tiles, two yellow dogs
drinking coffee from bowls. We could play a game
where we let the breakfast burn.
 
Outside there’s a world where every love scene
begins with a man in a doorway;
he walks over to the woman and says “Open your mouth.”"
544,Confession,Bruce Lansky,"I have a brief confession
that I would like to make.
If I dont get it off my chest
I'm sure my heart will break.

I didn't do my reading.
I watched TV instead—
while munching cookies, cakes, and chips
and cinnamon raisin bread.

I didn't wash the dishes.
I didn't clean the mess.
Now there are roaches eating crumbs—
a million, more or less.

I didn't turn the TV off.
I didn't shut the light.
Just think of all the energy
I wasted through the night.

I feel so very guilty.
I did a lousy job.
I hope my students don't find out
that I am such a slob."
545,Deep Deuce,Robert Polito,"As phantoms direct life from the shadows,

I leaned on something,
                                          and it broke.
 
My father on the porch with his crosswords said,
this must be what it feels like to be dead;
 
When I returned from the dead there was no one to greet me,
but still you are glad—
 
I wander the ruins the way my tongue
wanders my missing teeth,
the bricks and mortar of Deep Deuce
rotted like molars in an ancient mouth;
 
Here Charlie Christian might have walked—

                                  Step two: Visualize
 the person who is responsible for the curse. Imagine one end of a rope
 is tied around your waist and the other around that person. Picture yourself cutting
 the rope with a chainsaw as you call out, “You have no power over me!”
  
                                  Step three: Repeat
 twice a day for eleven days . . .
 
You visualize her green boots inside the furnace . . .
 
—No. You are in a crematorium and you see
her perfect and corruptible body on a tray sliding into fire;
 
Then you see yourself cutting the rope that ties you together with a saw;
 
And then at last your own imperfect and corruptible body—I mean, me—calls out
 
and I jump in after her."
546,The Great Awakening,Robert Polito,"Oh, de wars and de scrapes

                                                               —Otello, by T. D. Rice

Dreams may come from the enemy—
 
from the business of the past day—
 
from a disordered body—
 
from moral evil—
 
from God,
 
 through the medium of the Angels, and departed saints, as forewarnings to stir up and prepare the mind for the scenes ahead. 
     I fell into a slumber; and in it I dreamed that two devils entered the room, each with a chain in his hand; they laid hold on me, the one at my head, the other at my feet, and bound me fast, and breaking out the window, carried me a distance from the house and laid me on a spot of ice, and while the weaker devil flew off in flames of fire, the stronger one set out to carry me down to hell.
    I put my hands together and said, Lord I submit to go and preach thy gospel; only grant my peaceful hours to return, and open the door.
    Here I received the solemn news of the death of our only child.
  
    The vibration of the earth shook down the trees, thousands of willows were swept off like a pipe stem, about waist high, and the swamps became high ground, and high land became low ground, and two islands in the river were so shaken, washed away and sunk, as not to be found.
  
 From this I infer some trouble is at hand,
 But the film was already starting—
 
The sounds came in waves, higher
and higher, at the top of it
someone screaming—
 
Now what you call your great disappointment,
I call the Great Awakeneing—
 
When I heard (though not always
in these old forgotten words I remember) the first of three visions—
 
Yet if you tell me they are only
my dear dead returning,
I would not disbelieve you.
 
2.
 
It is an odd sort of fortune to have lived an adventurous life.
 
In my disgust, I left school and devoted
all my blighted spirit to minstrelsy;
I had no natural aptness for the banjo,
but for dancing—
such a remarkable gift few ever saw.
 
The first part of our performances
  we gave with white faces;
and by practicing to knock spin and toss the tambourine
back in my room,
I was now the “Scotch Girl” in plaid petticoats.
 
Besides my Highland Fling, I took the principal lady parts
in the negro ballets;
for a lad, I danced “Lucy Long” so admirably
a planter in one of the Southern States insisted on purchasing me,
until the door-tender kicked that planter down the stairs.
 
Old Ephraim was one of the most comical specimens
of the negro species,
the blackest face, largest mouth, whitest teeth;
What could he do?
Why, he could fetch water, black our boots, take care of our baggage.
 
My father said of Howie Gray
who worked beside him every day at the South Station PO
and put both his sons through college,
“He’s not an uppity Negro.”
My father meant that as a compliment.
 
There were tears in his eyes when Howie Gray died.
 
3.
 
Every man his own radio—
 
 It hath been thought that the dying speeches of such as have been executed among us
 might be of singular use to correct the crimes wherein too many do live
  
   Billington, disregarding the commotion he was causing and the certainty of apprehension, reloaded and stalked his enemy.
 
   She concealed her crime until the time of her delivery, and then being delivered alone by her self in a dark room, she murdered the harmless and helpless infant.
 
   Foster didn’t say a word. He just picked up a steal boomer and smashed Pikin over the head with it.
 
  I went forth to be delivered in the field, and dropping my child by the side of a little pond (whether alive or stillborn I cannot tell), I covered it over with dirt and snow and speedily returned home.
 
   He struck the helpless Kling again and again
 
   Mr. Spooner strove to speak, when down, Brooks took him by the throat and partly strangled him. Ross and Buchanan came out. Ross took Mr. Spooner’s watch and gave it to Buchanan. Brooks and Ross took him up and put him in the well head first. Before they carried him away, I, Buchanan, pulled off his shoes.
 
   Eight streaks of splattered blood. Eight murderous strokes of an axe or knife.
 
   Was found, by a person with a dog, crossing the fields, in a piece of woods a little distance from Brandywine to the Turk’s Head, two dead infants.
 
Now what you call your Great Awakening,
I call Much Ado, 
I call The Big Sleep—
  
But when did I become someone on whom
everything is lost?
 
Like the dream I lifted from my father like a Band-Aid—
 
Where I checked hats,
that instantly, embarrassingly disappeared—
 
My earnest offers to return the $1.00 gratuity
raining down on dead ears—
 
I thought I was boyish.
It availed me nothing."
547,Hollywood & God,Robert Polito,"If only God would save me,
I would know how to hurt you.
 
If only God would save me,
I would know who to sell my soul to.
 
Anything is an autobiography,
but this is a conversation—
 
William Burroughs insisted
literature lagged 50 years behind painting,
 
thinking no doubt about abstraction, collage,
fragmentation, his cut-ups.
 
But whatever that meant (why always 50 years?), or however
he presumed to rile other writers,
 
poetry probably does lag behind any credible media theory about it—
 
so that if I put a pine tree
into a poem,
 
a grove of pine trees
and beyond them the sea,
 
you’d think it was the same tree Wordsworth put there;
instead of two obligatory centuries of nature studies, all those
 
Technicolor vistas, torch songs, couples
drifting through leaves in Salem commercials.
 
Into one life and out another,
 
the way a junkie playing a writer,
a writer playing a priest,
 
so that when I finally blurted out,
 You-betrayed-me / I-wounded-you / We’re-so-unhappy
  
you assumed the burden of personal urgency,
supposed it was me speaking at the limits of my self-control
 
and not The Damned Don’t Cry, 
 Temptation, and Leave Her to Heaven.
  
You open your mouth and a tradition dribbles out.
 
But that’s mimesis—
 
how almost impossible to avoid mimesis,
anybody’s hardest truths prompting the most fractured constructions,
 
the way to think about God might be
to disobey God,
 
if only God’s wish to remain hidden,
 
so that if everything is an autobiography,
this is a conversion.
 
As my lives flash before me,
 
why must the yearning for God
trump all other yearnings?
 
You often hear converts confess
the drinking, his pills, her sexual addiction,
 
concealed inside them a yearning for God—
why not the other way around?
 
The admission of Jesus into your life
concealing instead the wish, say, a need
 
To be fucked senseless drunk drugged & screaming
 Oh God! Oh God! on a hotel bed . . .
 
God embraces our yearnings.
 
That afternoon my father heard his diagnosis of inoperable cancer,
my aunt Barbara demanded we get him to Lourdes
 
She demanded this with a glass of vodka in her hand—
she demanded this running her fingers up and down my leg—
she demanded this before she passed out in her car—
 
In the movie of my life,
my father died
 
after I forgave him,
 
& when my secret tormentor said may the ghosts of your dreams
gnaw at your belly like a wolf under your jacket,
 
did she really want revenge,
or was she just killing time?
 
For me God is a hair shirt, or he’s nothing;
for me God is a pain in the ass;
 
that’s mimesis, again,
 
this hour I tell you things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I’ll tell you.
 
The world is a road under the wall to the church,
the world is a church, & the world is a road,
 
& the world is a stone wall.
 
Still, he wanted her the way the Cardinal wanted the Caravaggio,
& when the ill-advised possessor of the painting resisted—
one night Papal Guards searched his house.
 
Of course contraband came to light, some illegal rifles,
& when the ill-advised possessor of the painting went to prison—
the Cardinal got his Caravaggio.
 
But I wasn’t a Cardinal, nephew to the Pope,
and you—
you were not a Caravaggio.
 
So I asked you to be in my movie."
548,Please Refrain from Talking During the Movie,Robert Polito,"When I can’t make you understand I repeat myself
I repeat
 
If you don’t stop asking me all these questions how
Will I understand anything
 
Please refrain from talking during the movie
 
I need a life that isn’t just about needing
To escape my life
 
Please God please may Carrie please fall for me
 
I want to show off my hidden camera
I’m an informer but I have my limits
 
You hurt him once before now what
If she’s there I don’t know if I can go
 
Please refrain from talking during the movie
 
Leave a message if you can’t reach me
To exit press enter and don’t forget your receipt
 
When I think I read new things I want
A life where I read and think new things
 
Please refrain from talking during the movie
 
I want to know nothing
Again
 
Please God please may Carrie please fall for me
 
I repeat myself when I can’t
Make you understand I repeat"
549,Three Horse Operas,Robert Polito,"for Patti Smith

At the end of Bing Crosby’s Riding High his horse
Will be buried in the clay of the racetrack where he fell,
As a lesson for all of us. Sad, waggish Bing,
The Mob didn’t want Broadway Bill to win, so the jockey
Pulled on the reins until the thoroughbred, straining
Over the finish line first, collapsed, heart attack.
 
I loved you like a guitar string breaking
Under the conviction of a clumsy hand—
Something like that . . . I suppose I must have
Been thinking of you and your complex and beautiful band,
Except the image demands I hold the guitar,
If not you, and the broken string, as
 
Over and over loudspeakers call riders to the starting gate.
The track bartender and a teller, a sharpshooter and the chess master
Wrestler, the petty con man and a cop, reprise their parts.
The heist gang dons clown masks, and
Sherry will betray George, and Johnny can’t love Fay,
And the fortune in the suitcase just blows away."
550,What the Dead Know,Robert Polito,"Air here is like the water
Of an aquarium that’s been lived in for a while—clear and still
                             Beyond the rigors
Of glass; appearing cold (and clear) as spring streams
                             Fed by snow and ice,
But unexpectedly warm to feel, and inviting; side-lit—
                             A vitality of shadows
Once you come into it, and long bars of light
                             Burning like spots,
Remarkable for the absence of dust in their sharp crossfires;
                             Heavy, as crystal
Is heavy, as if to move here would mean pushing against a force
                             Palpable, and strong;
Yet rich with prospects of life, comfortable
                             With the idea of life,
As if, put on its slide, every drop is stocked with wonders,
                             Swarming, about to burst—

                             Beautiful in a way,
One element sustaining another, our message brought home
                             So that the living
Might come to see. Harder to say that without them
                             We are nothing—
Water without air; or to speak of our isolation,
                             Or our special loneliness;
Or say as they look right through us, at their plants,
                             Pictures, books,
Windows, reflections, and blank white walls,
                             That we need them,
To orient ourselves and to tell us who we are;
                             Or that with each look
They are swimming to within our sights; or that we are always casting
                             Wider and wider
And that even now they are fighting to avoid our nets."
551,The Abandoned Hotel,Zachary Schomburg,"Inside the woods is an abandoned hotel.
Trees grow in the lobby
and up through the rooms.
Limbs jut out through the windows.
It looks like outside
inside.
 
I climb the trees
through 1000 rooms.
 
I look for you
in each of them.
 
You’re a long shiny line."
552,The Animal Spell,Zachary Schomburg,"Someone once told me that animals are people under spells, and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted. I recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan. I watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours, watched her peck bugs from her breast. I was sure she would make a beautiful bride, but she was always a black trumpeter swan. I once brushed a horse’s hair for 3 straight years until it crumpled into death. The truth is there is no such thing as spells. The world is always as it is, and always as it seems. And love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood."
553,The Fire Cycle,Zachary Schomburg,"There are trees and they are on fire. There are hummingbirds and they are on fire. There are graves and they are on fire and the things coming out of the graves are on fire. The house you grew up in is on fire. There is a gigantic trebuchet on fire on the edge of a crater and the crater is on fire. There is a complex system of tunnels deep underneath the surface with only one entrance and one exit and the entire system is filled with fire. There is a wooden cage we’re trapped in, too large to see, and it is on fire. There are jaguars on fire. Wolves. Spiders. Wolf-spiders on fire. If there were people. If our fathers were alive. If we had a daughter. Fire to the edges. Fire in the river beds. Fire between the mattresses of the bed you were born in. Fire in your mother’s belly. There is a little boy wearing a fire shirt holding a baby lamb. There is a little girl in a fire skirt asking if she can ride the baby lamb like a horse. There is you on top of me with thighs of fire while a hot red fog hovers in your hair. There is me on top of you wearing a fire shirt and then pulling the fire shirt over my head and tossing it like a fireball through the fog at a new kind of dinosaur. There are meteorites disintegrating in the atmosphere just a few thousand feet above us and tiny fireballs are falling down around us, pooling around us, forming a kind of fire lake which then forms a kind of fire cloud. There is this feeling I get when I am with you. There is our future house burning like a star on the hill. There is our dark flickering shadow. There is my hand on fire in your hand on fire, my body on fire above your body on fire, our tongues made of ash. We are rocks on a distant and uninhabitable planet. We have our whole life ahead of us."
554,New Kind of Light,Zachary Schomburg,"I move my hands
in these woods
to find her sex-parts.
 
We discover our sex-parts
make heat
and blue light.
 
We become outlines of ourselves—
 
long scratches
in the sky.
 
We have a daughter
who was never born.
 
She lives in the house
we never built,
 
but in this new light,
you can almost see
its tattered roof."
555,Squirrel Problem,Zachary Schomburg,"I watch a squirrel get run over by a car on my walk to work. She is lying dead in the street and still has an acorn in her little hands. I am amazed at how she is able to hold on to her acorn after being tumbled like that, after bouncing so high off the street. I walk over to the squirrel and see that her face is blown to bits and looks like uncased sausage spilling onto the asphalt. But that acorn is still so tight in her hands. I pick her up by her tail, take off my dress shirt and swaddle her in it, then put her in my bag. I know right where she is as I walk into work, everybody looking at me, everybody asking me about my shirtlessness. The world is as steady as if it were sewn into the skin of the universe."
556,Bane,Wendy Videlock,"Full of strength and laced
with fragility:

the thoroughbred,
the hummingbird,
and all things
cursed
with agility."
557,Cairo,Sara Miller,"The evidence was in and it went to the contrary.
The contrary wound around us rather like a river.
The river reacted, spider-like, tangling up its legs
with other wet parts we thought we knew,
such as creeks and fjords and deltas and such.

A beaver sits on the riverbank watching all of this unfold.
He doesn’t know what a fjord is, and he doesn’t care
for other waters, or even other beavers, or the merest
hint of other business, so he removes this evidence.

Then he builds a structure which for years he is rehabbing.
Inside it is hollow and there is his nest.
He is a dark little bastard, all the same.
The water had a fine way of   being, now it is tortured
by these nests and their vassal.

Yet the river doesn’t overthrow the beaver.
Quite the contrary. The river goes around polite as a snake.
It argues a tiny bit at the edges of the lodge,
where young beavers could be napping.

You and I would let loose a flood of tears. Not the river.
You and I would seep hotly into our darkest places.
Not the river. It is a long way from home
and has that on its mind, the day of rising,
when the temples will all be cleansed
and the whole unfathomable truth will out.

According to the waters. According to their book."
558,Countermeasures,Sara Miller,"I wish I could keep my thoughts in order
and my ducks in a row.
I wish I could keep my ducks in a thought
or my thoughts in a duck.
My point is that we all exist, wetly, in the hunt.
The ducks are aware of this
in their own way, which is floating.
The way of the mind is brevity.
There may be other thoughts on other days
in the minds of other and better men
and their constant companions, the women,
but these same tidy capsules — never.
This is just one of the things
I noticed about my thoughts
as they passed easefully by."
559,End Grain,Matthew Nienow,"is an opening, is all

of  the long
strands that make

the pathways for 
rays, bisecting 

annular rings,

vulnerable door
of  what makes

the holiest of
things."
560,The Fishermen’s Farewell,Robin Robertson,"Their long stares mark them apart; eyes gone 
to sea-colors: gray, foam-flecked 

and black in the undertow, blue 
as the blue banners of  the mackerel, whipping west.

On land, they are smoke-walkers, where each stone 
is a standing stone, every circle a stone circle.

They would be rumor if they could, in this frozen
landscape like a stopped sea, from the great stone keels

of  Callanish to the walls of  Dunnottar and Drum. 
They would be less even than rumor: 

to be ocean-stealers, to never throw a shadow — 
to dream the blank horizon and dread the sight of  land.

The drink storms through these men, uncompasses 
them, till they’re all at sea again.

Their houses, heeled over in the sand: 
each ruin now a cairn for kites.

And down by the quay
past empty pots, unmended nets, and boats:

this tiny bar, where men sleep upright
in their own element, as seals."
561,The Gargantuan Muffin Beauty Contest,Julian Stannard,"We were at the Edison Hotel on West 47th Street
for the annual muffin beauty contest — 
I can’t tell you how pumped up we were.
Times Square was having another psychotic judder.
The bellhop was all thumbs up: Sir, have a nice day 
and get one gratis. All those avenues of doors
and the Hispanic chambermaid who couldn’t speak English.
Spider-Man was doing all that Spider-Man shit 
just to get a bird’s eye view. Donna Summer
was almost dead and we were barely into spring.
I want to dance to “Love to Love You Baby,” I want to groan.
I’ve never seen so many high-quality muffins.
If  I wasn’t a religious man, and maybe I wasn’t
I would have said the muffins were walking on water:
I’ve never felt so half-and-half. Have you read the Bible? 
The bellhop said: You ain’t seen muffin yet. 
They were drifting in from Queens, Brooklyn, Harlem, 
The Bronx, Manhattan muffins too and that weird 
cute coke-faced muffin who’d taken the subway 
from Coney Island. If only I were a betting man, 
but hey I am a betting man, it’s Coney Island every time. 
Lou Reed isn’t getting any younger. Zappa said,
Girl you thought he was a man but he was a muffin,
he hung around till you found he didn’t know nuthin’.
In the lobby Nina Simone was singing, I Loves You Muffin
and in the restroom they piped in “Mack the Knife”: 
Hey Suky Tawdry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum
and old Miss Lulu Brown. Muffin The Romance 
was the biggest show in town. We were hurtling back
to the 1970s and sometimes the 1970s are almost 
as good as the 1930s. I want my muffins to be ahistorical: 
shit just to say ahistorical makes me joyful. 
I saw Leonard Cohen crooning with a couple 
of octogenarian muffins and I’m telling you now 
the lobby was pleasantly disturbing. You may find 
yourself   behind the wheel of a large automobile.
You may find yourself  in another part of  the world.
You may find yourself  at the gargantuan muffin beauty contest
and you may ask yourself, Well, how did I get here?
Times Square was having another psychotic judder.
Love is in the air, it’s in the whisper of the trees.
This is not America, this is the cover version:
sun, sex, sin, divine intervention, death and destruction,
welcome to The Sodom and Gomorrah Show.
All those white muffins trying to be black muffins!
Give us our daily muffin, save us from temptation.
Jimmy Buffett was singing, Why don’t we get drunk
and screw? In Times Square the most beautiful muffins
in the world were hanging on a thousand screens.
Where are my singing Tibetan balls? Am I dead?"
562,Gravitas,Sara Miller,"The overweight, overnight parts
that came to me in a dream.

Their clothes no longer fit,
it was this that brought them
to me crying, their faces twitching.

That had to end. No, they said,
it didn’t. So I rolled over to ghosts 
that couldn’t dent a pillow.

The clock shed. Night pulled its
burdens into harbor and I woke,
glad for the day, its telltale light,

its flying minute, that genie work,
and the everlasting perturbations
of my people, their glories,

their heavy last words,
and for these, I rose."
563,Hesperus,Shann Ray,"My four-year-old daughter handed me a card. 
To Daddy written on the front
and inside a rough field 
of  five-pointed lights, and the words
You’re my favorite Daddy in the stars.

In this western night we all light the sky
like Vega, Deneb, Altair, Albireo, 
the Summer Triangle, 
Cygnus the Swan, our hair 
tangled with wood and gravel, 
our eyes like vacant docks
that beckon every boat.

Tell me about the word
stars, I said.

Oh, she said. Sorry. 
I didn’t know
how to spell world."
565,If You’re Crowish,Wendy Videlock,"If  you’re crowish and you know it

Hoooo

If  you’re thirsty and you mean it
breathe an ahhh

Ahhhh

You are putty in my hands

said the wind

to the moon."
566,Letter to a Lost Friend,Barbara Hamby,"There must be a Russian word to describe what has happened
              between us, like ostyt, which can be used
for a cup of  tea that is too hot, but after you walk to the next room,
              and return, it is too cool; or perekhotet, 
which is to want something so much over months
              and even years that when you get it, you have lost 
the desire. Pushkin said, when he saw his portrait by Kiprensky, 
              “It is like looking into a mirror, but one that flatters me.” 
What is the word for someone who looks into her friend’s face
              and sees once smooth skin gone like a train that has left
the station in Petersburg with its wide avenues and nights
              at the Stray Dog Cafe, sex with the wrong men,
who looked so right by candlelight, when everyone was young
              and smoked hand-rolled cigarettes, painted or wrote
all night but nothing good, drank too much vodka, and woke
              in the painful daylight with skin like fresh cream, books
everywhere, Lorca on Gogol, Tolstoy under Madame de Sévigné, 
              so that now, on a train in the taiga of  Siberia,
I see what she sees — all my books alphabetized and on shelves, 
              feet misshapen, hands ribbed with raised veins,
neck crumpled like last week’s newspaper, while her friends 
              are young, their skin pimply and eyes bright as puppies’,
and who can blame her, for how lucky we are to be loved 
              for even a moment, though I can’t help but feel like Pushkin, 
a rough ball of  lead lodged in his gut, looking at his books 
              and saying, “Goodbye, my dear friends,” as those volumes 
close and turn back into oblong blocks, dust clouding 
              the gold leaf that once shimmered on their spines."
567,A Lizard in Spanish Valley,Wendy Videlock,"A lizard does not make a sound,
it has no song,
it does not share my love affairs
with flannel sheets,
bearded men, interlocking
silver rings, the moon, 
the sea, or ink.

But sitting here the afternoon,
I’ve come to believe
we do share a love affair
and a belief —
in wink, blink, stone,
and heat. 
Also, air.

This is not a fable,
nor is it bliss. 

Impatience,
remember this."
568,Moves in the Field,Sara Miller,"Had to come in out of the people,
they blew me about so.
Was told of the life taking place
elsewhere. Went to check on that,
flying late and low over the west.

Saw no house, no shade.
Sat down on the damp bank
on the far shore at the left
edge of the world, against which
the sea endlessly lapped.

So now there were two of us,
who beat the world by
day and caressed it by night
and the world didn’t say
yea and she didn’t say nay."
569,"My Dad, in America",Shann Ray,"Your hand on my jaw
              but gently

and that picture of you
punching through snow
              to bring two deer, a gopher,

and a magpie 
to the old Highwalker woman

who spoke only Cheyenne
              and traced our footprints

on leather she later chewed to soften. 
              We need to know in America there is still blood

for forgiveness. 
Dead things for the new day."
570,Nocturne,Sara Miller,"Last night in bed
I mouthed a prayer
of my own composition.

It sounded offhand, it was carelessly
addressed, it twisted my meaning
entirely, it left an ache,
I didn’t know what I was doing.

So I took down my yellowed copy
of French With Pictures
by the late literary critic I.A. Richards
and I put my petition
into soft French words.

I.A. Richards believed that irony
was the language of redemption.
He wrote and lectured famously on this,
but his masterpiece was French With Pictures.
“The chapeau is on the table.”
“The man with the beard stands before the window.”
“She comes from a village by the sea.”

There is no improving the old traditions.
They are already mortal, partial, and wrong.
The woman at the table by the window
puts her head into her hands.
“Into your hands,” she said."
571,"Not for You, Not for the World",Barbara Perez,"Because a little reprieve, a little hope (even for those whom I love)

would exculpate the world of  its actions, I hold to logic steadfast.

Belief, without knowledge, dislodges perception of all the empirical world

— (even for you, mom and dad). Know that if, for you, on some filthy lie

I could wish for the mind’s persistence after death, I would say no."
572,Ode to the Belt Sander & This Cocobolo Sapwood,Matthew Nienow,"The belt kicks on with a whir & the whir
licks the end grain of the offcut with a hint

of  hesitation. A small wind of ochre dust
sweeps off the belt before the belt comes back

to where it was. The whole room swells
with the scent of cinnamon & desire.

How imprecise the smell of desire.

The wood takes on a sheen, a gloss
the grain can live behind without worry

of  being forgotten. A single knot blinks
out of the small block and becomes

the eye of a hummingbird, its beak
bending around the edge of the wood,

its small song captured in the annular rings. 
To think, this block was tossed in

with the scraps. That the bird
could have been lost. Or burned."
573,Ode to the Gain,Matthew Nienow,"gain — a bevel cut into plank ends in traditional lapstrake boat construction that allows otherwise lapped planks to lay flush at stem and transom.

There’s the paring chisel’s purpose 
in the steamed cedar strake, its long warp 

laid strong against the bench,
whose pocked surface is the book 

of what has already been made,
or marred in learning’s wake — & clamped 

now in the jaws one is 
waiting for its match, for the chisel to elaborate

the pencil’s scribed hypothesis, under which
lies another path, & through a tilting eye

the curving bevel’s made, the chisel rolling
back tight scrolls of thinnest grain & what bright 

sleeves begin to fleece the floor; there is a lack
given to the wood, some short song cut loose

from the lignin’s name, that a longer &
more buoyant melody be made."
574,Ode to the Steam Box,Matthew Nienow,"The steam box is used for bending   frames and planks in traditional boatbuilding.

With a match I became a man 
who summoned diesel

from the yellow caverns
of a ten-gallon jug, called the flame

now hissing out the hose 
at the small house of  water, that

rusted drum from which travels
an excruciating wetness — this

is what makes the body 
otherwise, what makes it

sing. To take that 
which has decided on a shape, 

and bend, without breaking, 
the lengthening fibers. To give 

the straight thing curve. 
To make of  the tree a song 

grown long in a linseed skin,
the slick hot strake waiting 

to become parcel 
of  the round world again."
575,Proverbial,Wendy Videlock,"It’s always darkest before the leopard’s kiss.

Where there’s smoke there is emphasis. 

A bird in the hand is bound for the stove.

The pen is no mightier than the soul. 

Never underestimate the nib of corruption. 

Better late than suffer the long introduction.

All work and no play is the way of  the sloth.

If  you can dream it bring the child the moth. 

He is not wise that parrots the wise.

All that glitters has been revised. 

An idle mind is a sign of  the time.

The less things change the more we doubt design."
576,Spellbound,Sara Miller,"Two women on a train
sit beside me.

I am young and the world
is flying and I am watching.

One of them is frosty.
The other turns like a leaf

to hand me something —
it looked for all the world like a page.

I thought at the time
that it needed me and I was right.

The letters fell into place
and simple flowers grew.

Now it talks unceasingly
in long white verses

as if at a wedding,
something women understand

and gently want and then regift.
I myself agree with Herbert,

who in a dark mood conjured
the mushrooms underfoot

unseen by bride or groom
and with him I say, Perhaps

the world is unimportant
after all, though this is not

what one discusses with
women on a train, no matter

how long the journey,
or untroubled the land."
577,Strange Little Prophets,Barbara Perez,"When is the smell of a blackberry tree
a harbinger of  violent movement
rather than simply the recollection of
a childhood Sunday dress hem-dipped
in mud, handprinted with juice and seeds?
Hard to say. A mind, when playing tricks
is at its most sincere — at home raking
through the body’s history, repeating
the strange and nostalgic. The taste of
dirty copper, the imagined cockroach
in the corner, the sluggish slow of  the clock
 — doctors call these strange little prophets
warning signs of a seizure, synaptic misfires
looming like a song discordant, until the body
 — an unplucked string — is finally strummed."
578,Their Pleas,Kelly Cherry,"They pluck my sleeve, tug my hand, pull
my hair. They do not kneel to kiss my hem.
No, it’s not like that but they want tokens.
Again, not souvenirs but something small
and useful, something that will help them out
after life, maybe in an underworld.
They need a sighted guide to lead them to
the river, and they need a remnant of
the old world as they embark for the older world,
the one that has existed since the first
grievous death. They need to feel they still
can touch and still be touched, as once they did
and were, and one would have to be a cold,
uncaring woman to deny their pleas:
a woman with a bulletproof  heart,
without a memory of life on earth."
579,Three Persons,Fanny Howe,"The fields are infertile
as far as I can tell.
Their winter systems
sparkle like the diamonds
that pelt Neptune.

Limpid silvers

back in town.

To them we run

to a well-shaped ethics.

580,A Vase,Brad Leithauser,"There was a vase
that held the world’s riches, but it wasn’t cheap.
It cost a dime — and this in a time and place

when dimes were sizable, especially for
a girl of eight whose construction-worker father
was unemployed. The old metaphor

was literal in this case and she
counted her pennies till there were ten — 
then embarked on a mission of great secrecy,

a purchase whose joys ran so deep,
seventy years later, as she told the tale again,
her face flushed. It was a birthday gift for her mother. 

There was a race
of people heretofore glimpsed only on hanging scrolls
in library books. They were on the vase —  

the smallest whole figures imaginable,
purposeful and industrious
as they fished or planted rice or hiked a hill 

whose spiral trail led to a temple perched upon
a crag between cloud and waterfall.
They were a vision exported from Japan — 

a country far as the moon, and far more beautiful,
whose artists grasped an eight-year-old girl’s soul’s
need for the minutely amplitudinous.

There was a place
(Detroit, the thirties) now slipped from sight,
though here and there I’ll catch some holdover trace — 

maybe the grille on an old apartment door, 
or a slumped block of  houses, draped
in torn sheets of rain, apparently posing for 

black-and-white photographs. Even the out-
of-a-job, men like my grandfather, donned hats back then
before leaving the house — to circle endlessly about,

as if a lost job were a lost coin that might 
yet be found on the street where it had been dropped, 
making them whole again.

There was a face,
rucked with care, that would dreamily soften
if  talk floated off toward some remote someplace

beyond the seas. My grandmother had a yen for the faraway
(which she imparted to her daughter),
even as her life was tethered between a gray

icy motionless Midwestern city — 
stalled like a car with a frozen ignition — 
and a Tennessee farm without electricity. 

(She did once see Washington — cherry season — and often 
spoke of  those long pink walkways beside the water 
that were  Japan’s gift to a grateful nation.)

There is a vase — 
a piece of gimcrack that somehow 
made its way to a crowded curio case

in a small souvenir shop
in Detroit, seventy-plus years ago — 
which today stands atop 

the mantel in the apartment in DC
where my fading mother is now living.
When she was eight, in 1933,

she gave it to my grandmother, who 
for all her poverty bequeathed her daughter so 
rich a bounty, including a taste for giving:

the gift of grace. 
It seems a little miracle
almost — that it’s intact, the little vase,

conveying what its makers set out to convey:
an inward island spared by Time,
by the times. These days, she can scarcely say

who she gave it to, or on what occasion.
A — birthday? The pilgrim climbs the winding hill
forever, station by station,

and “Isn’t it beautiful?”
she asks. “You bought it for a dime,”
I tell her. It holds the world’s riches still."
581,I like to see it lap the Miles - (383),Emily Dickinson,"I like to see it lap the Miles -
And lick the Valleys up - 
And stop to feed itself at Tanks - 
And then - prodigious step

Around a Pile of Mountains - 
And supercilious peer
In Shanties - by the sides of Roads - 
And then a Quarry pare

To fit its sides
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid - hooting stanza - 
Then chase itself down Hill - 

And neigh like Boanerges - 
Then - prompter than a Star
Stop - docile and omnipotent
At it's own stable door -"

               I stop my hand midair.
 
               If I touch her there everything about me will be true.
               The New World discovered without pick or ax.
 
               I will be what Brenda Jones was stoned for in 1969.
               I saw it as a girl but didn’t know I was taking in myself.
 
               My hand remembers, treading the watery room,
               just behind the rose-veiled eyes of memory.
 
Alone in the yard tucked beneath the hood of her car,
lucky clover all about her feet, green tea-sweet necklace
for her mud-pie crusty work boots.
 
She fends off their spit & words with silent two-handed
twists & turns of her socket wrench. A hurl of sticks &
stones and only me to whisper for her, from sidewalk far,
 
 break my bones. A grown woman in grease-pocket overalls
inside her own sexy transmission despite the crowding of
hurled red hots. Beneath the hood of her candy-apple Camaro:
  
souped, shiny, low to the ground.
  
               The stars over the Atlantic are dangling
               salt crystals. The room at the Seashell Inn is
               $20 a night; special winter off-season rate.
               No one else here but us and the night clerk,
               five floors below, alone with his cherished
               stack of Spiderman. My lips are red snails
               in a primal search for every constellation
               hiding in the sky of your body. My hand
               waits for permission, for my life to agree
               to be changed, forever. Can Captain Night
               Clerk hear my fingers tambourining you
               there on the moon? Won’t he soon climb
               the stairs and bam! on the hood of this car?
               You are a woman with film reels for eyes.
               Years of long talking have brought us to the
               land of the body. Our skin is one endless
               prayer bead of brown. If my hand ever lands,
               I will fly past dreaming Australian Aborigines.
               The old claw hammer and monkey wrench
               that flew at Brenda Jones will fly across the
               yard of ocean at me. A grease rag will be
               thrust into my painter’s pants against my
               will. I will never be able to wash or peel
               any of this away. Before the night is over
               someone I do not know will want the keys
               to my ’55 silver Thunderbird. He will chase
               me down the street. A gaggle of spooked
               hens will fly up in my grandmother’s yard,
               never to lay another egg, just as I am jump-
               ed, kneed, pulled finally to the high ground
               of sweet clover."
583,Dancing with Strom,Nikky Finney,"I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, there’s not enough
            troops in the army to force the southern people to break
            down segregation and accept the Negro [pronounced Nigra]
            into our theatres, into our swimming pools, into our homes,
            and into our churches.
                                    —Strom Thurmond, South Carolina

                                         for the States’ Rights Party, 1948
 
            I said, “I’m gonna fight Thurmond from the mountain to
            the sea.”
                                    —Modjeska Monteith Simkins, Civil
                              Rights Matriarch, South Carolina, 1948
 

The youngest has been married off.
 
He is as tall as Abraham Lincoln. Here, on his
wedding day, he flaunts the high spinning laugh
of a newly freed slave. I stand above him, just
off the second-floor landing, watching
the celebration unfold.
 
Uncle-cousins, bosom buddies, convertible cars
of nosy paramours, strolling churlish penny-
pinchers pour onto the mansion estate. Below,
Strom Thurmond is dancing with my mother.
 
The favorite son of South Carolina has already
danced with the giddy bride and the giddy bride’s
mother. More women await: Easter dressy,
drenched in caramel, double exposed, triple cinched,
lined up, leggy, ready.
 
I refuse to leave the porch.
 
If I walk down I imagine he will extend his
hand, assume I am next in his happy darky line,
#427 on his dance card. His history
and mine, burnt cork and blackboard chalk,
concentric, pancaked, one face, two histories,
slow dragging, doing the nasty.
 
My father knows all this.
 
Daddy’s Black Chief Justice legs straddle the boilerplate
carapace of the CSS H. L. Hunley, lost Confederate
submarine, soon to be found just off the coast of
Charleston. He keeps it fully submerged by
applying the weight of every treatise he has
ever written against the death penalty of
South Carolina. Chanting “Briggs v. Elliott,”
he keeps the ironside door of the submarine shut.
No hands.
 
His eyes are a Black father’s beacon, search-
lights blazing for the married-off sons, and
on the unmarried, whale-eyed nose-in-book
daughter, born unmoored, quiet, yellow,
strategically placed under hospital lights to
fully bake. The one with the most to lose.
 
There will be no trouble. Still, he chain-
smokes. A burning stick of mint & Indian
leaf seesaws between his lips. He wants
me to remember that trouble is a fire that
runs like a staircase up then down. Even
on a beautiful day in June.
 
I remember the new research just out:
What the Negro gave America
Chapter 9,206:
 
 Enslaved Africans gifted porches to North
 America. Once off the boats they were told,
 then made, to build themselves a place—to live.
  
They build the house that will keep them alive.
 
Rather than be the bloody human floret on
yet another southern tree, they imagine higher
ground. They build landings with floor enough
to see the trouble coming. Their arced imaginations
nail the necessary out into the floral air. On the
backs and fronts of twentypenny houses,
a watching place is made for the ones who will
come tipping with torch & hog tie through the
quiet woods, hoping to hang them as decoration
in the porcupine hair of longleaf.
 
The architecture of Black people is sui generis.
This is architecture dreamed by the enslaved:
 
Their design will be stolen.
Their wits will outlast gold.
My eyes seek historical rest from the kiss-
kiss theater below; Strom Thurmond’s
it’s-never-too-late-to-forgive-me chivaree.
I search the tops of yellow pine while my
fingers reach, catch, pinch my father’s
determined-to-rise smoke.
 
Long before AC African people did the
math: how to cool down the hot air of
South Carolina?
 
If I could descend, without being trotted
out by some roughrider driven by his
submarine dreams, this is what I’d take
my time and scribble into the three-tiered,
white créme wedding cake:
 
 Filibuster. States’ Rights. The Grand Inquisition
 of the great Thurgood Marshall. This wedding
 reception would not have been possible without
 the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (opposed by
 you-know-who).
  
The Dixiecrat senator has not worn his
sandy seersucker fedora to the vows.
The top of Strom Thurmond’s bald head
reveals a birthmark tattooed in contrapposto
pose: Segregation Forever.
 
All my life he has been the face of hatred;
the blue eyes of the Confederate flag,
the pasty bald of white men pulling wooly
heads up into the dark skirts of trees,
the sharp, slobbering, amber teeth of
German shepherds, still clenched inside
the tissue-thin, (still marching), band-leader
legs of Black schoolteachers, the single-
minded pupae growing between the legs of
white boys crossing the tracks, ready to
force Black girls into fifth-grade positions,
Palmetto state-sanctioned sex 101.
 
I didn’t want to dance with him.
 
My young cousin arrives at my elbow.
Her beautiful lips the color of soft-skin
mangoes. She pulls, teasing the stitches
of my satin bridesmaid gown, “You better
go on down there and dance with Strom—
while he still has something left.”
 
I don’t tell her it is unsouthern for her
to call him by his first name, as if they
are familiar. I don’t tell her: To bear
witness to marriage is to believe that
everything moving through the sweet
wedding air can be confidently, left—
to Love.
 
I stand on the landing high above the
beginnings of Love, holding a plastic
champagne flute, drinking in the warm
June air of South Carolina. I hear my
youngest brother’s top hat joy. Looking
down I find him, deep in the giddy crowd,
modern, integrated, interpretive.
 
For ten seconds I consider dancing with
Strom. His Confederate hands touch
every shoulder, finger, back that I love.
I listen to the sound of Black laughter
shimmying. All worry floats beyond
the gurgling submarine bubbles,
the white railing, every drop of
champagne air.
 
I close my eyes and Uncle Freddie
appears out of a baby’s breath of fog.
(The dead are never porch bound.)
He moves with ease where I cannot.
He walks out on the rice-thrown air,
heaving a lightning bolt instead of
a wave. Suddenly, there is a table set,
complete with 1963 dining room stars,
they twinkle twinkle up & behind him.
Thelonious, Martin, Malcolm, Nina,
Dakota, all mouths Negro wide &
open have come to sing me down.
His tattered almanac sleeps curled like
a wintering slug in his back pocket.
His dark Dogon eyes jet to the scene
below, then zoom past me until they are
lost in the waning sugilite sky. Turning
in the shadows of the wheat fields,
he whispers a truth plucked from
the foreword tucked in his back pocket:
 Veritas: Black people will forgive you
quicker than you can say Orangeburg
 Massacre.
  
History does not keep books on the
handiwork of slaves. But the enslaved
who built this Big House, long before
I arrived for this big wedding, knew
the power of a porch.
 
This native necessity of nailing down
a place, for the cooling off of air,
in order to lift the friendly, the kindly,
the so politely, the in-love-ly, jubilant,
into the arms of the grand peculiar,
for the greater good of
the public spectacular:
 
us
giving us
away."
584,Dirt Cowboy Café,Cynthia Huntington,"Heart, oh heart,
I sit here writing your name
on pieces of paper,
folded, hidden, misplaced . . .
found again.
 
There is the element of saying
and there is the element of making:
one needn’t choose.
I am singing the dream out from the ice,
asking it to carry me
like a horse or a river, down and away.
 
This day, here in paned-glass sun:
the young waitress shaking out her apron
and retying it flat across her stomach—
a bit of vanity—her hair swept off her neck,
crash of a milk bottle
on the granite counter, cream
spread in a mild pool toward the rim,
and the roots of habit and longing
briefly seized by the mind.
 
So noisy here! The sound echoes
out of years, brought to this
showing forth, unrehearsed.
It seems we wake
and find ourselves repeating,
embodying the ancient gestures
by which we recognize
ourselves completed.
 
Not one of us could be born
and invent life—it must show through us—
the arm flung in the air, the coffee poured out,
and down the street, someone hurrying by,
head down against the wind.
 
And a man and a woman
come to an old grief,
carved in them, carved
into them
—the old way of water wearing rock—
by law, and the hatred
between them is equal
to the hope neither will release.
 
Each wants to be whole,
to embody all of time, when nothing
in this world is whole, and
this is by law.
 
When my father said bitterly
to my mother: you have changed,
he meant, without meaning to say,
how she had changed him. A man
holds his head down against the wind.
Yet the wind fills him
with the dust of temples,
the breath of the dead.
 
The dream of the light
inside the branches—
a gleam of wet, glimmer that is a bud,
the leaf within the bud.
 
The photographer comes inside
and closes the lens of his camera.
Then he is the lens. Then my eye
is the light. This
is the element of saying.
The young waitress flings a paper cup
behind her, into the trash can.
That is a saying. The cream swirled
into the coffee, the sugar
dissolving, disembodied,
and the body of the manager disappears,
swallowed into a doorway.
 
The element of making is slow,
uncertain as a temple,
a falling forward, stitching back,
like a stone wall, like the panes in an
arched window, like a repetition
chosen beyond necessity.
 
Yet somehow we have seen all this before—
the girl in the fur hat
speaking syrup into a phone;
the falseness of her charm
is an ancient imposter, familiar and
therefore true.
A door is opened and falls
closed. Suddenly at every table
someone looks down and is reading—
books, newspapers, calendars,
reading tea leaves, reading bones.
 
A woman in a periwinkle jacket: I am reading
her shoulders as the day introspects.
In dream the passive construction
and the past perfect tense prevail:
 she was being pushed on a swing.
The woman with many television credits
gazes out the window, heavy with years,
forgetting herself, forgetting sorrow,
the false husband, the crippled child,
the old plots forgetting,
  
and it is suddenly lovely, as free as
something read or dreamed; the young
waitress with sun on her
face—her unblemished face—looks up,
from the middle of eternity, her desire
immaculate in the moment.
  
When a word is beautiful
above all others—your name—
when a woman appears as a bird of prey
and we turn away,
hoping not to be recognized—oh heart!—
 
when the light on the branches
flares in a window with no sky,
this is old story reading us, these are springs
from words laid down before
and ahead of us, and in the moment
we are making an answer."
585,Meds,Cynthia Huntington,"1.
 
Living from pill to pill, from bed to couch,
what doesn’t kill me only makes me dizzy.
Pain dissolves like chalk in water,
grit on the bottom of the glass.
 
Waiting takes forever,
throbs to the soles of my feet, Bella noche . . .
 
Hives as large as mice hump up under my skin
(“no more barbiturates for you, Cynthia!”)
—itch, stretch, I don’t fit my flesh—
sting, tingle, prick, the sorcerer’s threat.
 
There’s a knife stabbed through my left eye.
My right foot is made of elephant hide
and weighs in at roughly one cartload of potatoes.
Oxygen twenty-four hours; I’m swelled with steroids,
 
prednisone buzz in the brain; a motel room
with sixteen foreign workers sleeping in shifts,
playing reggae at three a.m.

Oh I love my white pill
that makes the black fist of pain unclench,
unspasming the nerves. I float,
released to darkness visible,
worlds dissolving.
 
And the yellow pill, bitter on my tongue,
that wakes me at 2 a.m.
writing out plans in Arabic
to organize an expedition to the Pole.
Drug of hubris searing my eyes,
my scrawl unreadable in daylight: foil my enemies.
 
Bitter taste of fugue,
my hand shakes: some foreign being in my brain giving orders.
You must You must You will.
 
Later, the pungent brown liquor
shoots the dark with threads of gold behind my eyes.
One flash as the mind goes out.

I must elude pain
                                                            float past clarity

                                                            slammed down like a housefly.
 
It’s a big dodge.
 
Fly on a stovetop
                                                            sizzle and ash pop.
 
This is illusion,
                                                                        mental confusion
 
                                                            born in the synapse.
What can be undone
                                                            down to the last gasp.
It’s a hodgepodge.
 
If you kill pain
                                                you will become pain;
 
pain does not feel pain,
                                                            no nerves in the brain.
 
It’s a mind-fuck.
 
It’s just your bad luck.
 
                                                            A torpor sealed my brain
                                                            I felt no humans near
                                                            it seemed to me I could not feel
                                                            or touch or see or hear.
 
I don’t know who I am
                                                            without my medicine.
My skin will crawl with bugs
                                                            if I don’t get my drugs.
My brain’s a maelstrom,
                                                            singing a sad song.
Reality is so cruel.
 
Prednisone oh prednisone
so fast my mind racing, never tasting
rest.

                                                            (only wait, the fit will pass.)

Floppy bow tie, big furry hands.)
 
Percodan, Percocet, let you go, let you rest.

Barbiturate babykins, narcotic slut,

Painkiller, painkiller, I have a new friend,
better than my old friend,
plugging holes in the brain:
Sigmund Freud, Sigmund Freud, Sigmund Freud, Cocaine!
 
I want a soft landing; let me float.
Once the seizure lifted me and threw me down.
I did not like it. I did not like lying there
on the floor looking up
through air like green water.

And there is one so dark, a ghost,
it passes through the mesh of thought
without tearing a strand, whispering
destinies perceived true, pronouncing
sentences of death.
 
 
5.
 
A cloud, the absence of a noun, no name,
roaring far away in the summer
dark like a train, or a giant fan, or a highway that never stops.
The mind explodes in the dark of space,
unnursed by atmospheres,
as air raid sirens scream for blood
and I am only nerves, strung on constellations,
meridians and vectors quivering. A red and yellow
capsule invades the chemistry of thought; cathode rays blast
from the television screen and signals pass deep into space
until the stars are singing “Rosalita.” You
will not remember this night."

unanimous: that this is his kind of town—

1.
 
After twenty I stopped counting,
not like my friend Beverly, who sewed
an embroidered satin star on her bell-bottoms
for every new guy she fucked.
She had them running down both legs
and around the billowing hem,
and was starting up the inseam
when the jeans gave out in the wash.
 
It was a boys’ game anyway, those years
of our extended homage to the penis:
the guitar playing the penis, drums saluting it,
cock rock, Molotov cocktail, the motorcycle
gripped between the thighs, and I went down,
we all went down, in the old cultural disaster
of idol worship—a thousand-year bender.
Only this time it was the adolescent member,
oiled and laved, thrust forward arcing,
thin with ache, all tight flesh poked upward,
claiming its own. How it came and went,
penetrating but never settling down,
and how often we were caused to admire it:
hairless sweet warrior, raider against the State.
 
But I have this sweet pink flower
here between my legs—I put my hand down and touch it,
still soft and wet, and many-folded, endlessly opening,
hiding, seeking, hidden and sought,
but never very much admired or even smiled on
in those years, never served much less sung to.
Not a garden then but a citadel,
a wall to be breached, a new land claimed,
but linger there? No, I would say
there was an overall lack of appreciation,
 
though breasts were well respected, slopping loose
under T-shirts like little animals,
and I would feel my nipples brush the cotton
with pleasure, see them regarded also with pleasure.
Still, sex then was a taking, like spoils of war, a victory
over all those straight fucks back home, marooned
in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red
and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways.
 
And God knows it felt good those nights.
I was ready, it was ready, to open and answer the call.
And take me down and roll me over, yes, and give
it to me—but why all this riding away afterward?
 
Where was everyone going
and why didn’t I get to ride along? Who knew at first
nothing had changed, just wanting the thrust and tug
and slam up against the headboard, I should say so,
but left still wanting more, wanting to leap
out of centuries’ shame and be something new,
not this old consolation of women for the powerless,
some kind of cosmic door prize awarded
just for showing up with a dick,
some proof to themselves these boys were men.
 
“You’re good,” he said. Hell, I wasn’t taking a typing test,
I was fighting to live in a dying world.
I was throwing myself away, an offering to wildest space,
surrender to the mind’s dissolve, the body’s electric light,
nerve endings firing like exploding stars.
“You’re good,” they all said:
you’d think somebody was doing a survey.
Girls say yes to boys who say no, and then
your professor asks if you’re wearing underwear,
when you meet for your conference on the poetry of Yeats.
 
Crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car
after a visit to the after-hours doctor’s office in Sarnia.
Nodding out in the back seat, pills wearing off.
He was a legend among undergraduates:
cheap and reliable, always on call,
until a month later the headlines screamed
“Abortion Doc!” when a girl died in his office
and he dragged her down to the river
and dumped her body in the underbrush."
590,Renascence,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"All I could see from where I stood
 Was three long mountains and a wood;
 I turned and looked another way,
 And saw three islands in a bay.
 So with my eyes I traced the line 
 Of the horizon, thin and fine,
 Straight around till I was come
 Back to where I'd started from; 
 And all I saw from where I stood
 Was three long mountains and a wood.
  
 Over these things I could not see;
 These were the things that bounded me;
 And I could touch them with my hand,
 Almost, I thought, from where I stand.
 And all at once things seemed so small
 My breath came short, and scarce at all.
  
 But, sure, the sky is big, I said;
 Miles and miles above my head;
 So here upon my back I'll lie
 And look my fill into the sky.
 And so I looked, and, after all,
 The sky was not so very tall.
 The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,
 And—sure enough!—I see the top! 
 The sky, I thought, is not so grand;
 I 'most could touch it with my hand!
 And reaching up my hand to try,
 I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
  
 I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity
 Came down and settled over me;
 Forced back my scream into my chest,
 Bent back my arm upon my breast,
 And, pressing of the Undefined
 The definition on my mind,
 Held up before my eyes a glass
 Through which my shrinking sight did pass
 Until it seemed I must behold
 Immensity made manifold;
 Whispered to me a word whose sound
 Deafened the air for worlds around,
 And brought unmuffled to my ears
 The gossiping of friendly spheres,
 The creaking of the tented sky,
 The ticking of Eternity.
  
 I saw and heard, and knew at last
 The How and Why of all things, past,
 And present, and forevermore.
 The Universe, cleft to the core,
 Lay open to my probing sense
 That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence
 But could not,—nay! But needs must suck
 At the great wound, and could not pluck
 My lips away till I had drawn
 All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn!
 For my omniscience paid I toll
 In infinite remorse of soul.
  
 All sin was of my sinning, all
 Atoning mine, and mine the gall
 Of all regret. Mine was the weight 
 Of every brooded wrong, the hate
 That stood behind each envious thrust,
 Mine every greed, mine every lust.
  
 And all the while for every grief,
 Each suffering, I craved relief
 With individual desire,—
 Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire
 About a thousand people crawl;
 Perished with each,—then mourned for all!
  
 A man was starving in Capri;
 He moved his eyes and looked at me;
 I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,
 And knew his hunger as my own.
 I saw at sea a great fog bank
 Between two ships that struck and sank;
 A thousand screams the heavens smote;
 And every scream tore through my throat.
  
 No hurt I did not feel, no death
 That was not mine; mine each last breath
 That, crying, met an answering cry
 From the compassion that was I.
 All suffering mine, and mine its rod;
 Mine, pity like the pity of God.
  
 Ah, awful weight! Infinity
 Pressed down upon the finite Me!
 My anguished spirit, like a bird,
 Beating against my lips I heard;
 Yet lay the weight so close about
 There was no room for it without.
 And so beneath the weight lay I
 And suffered death, but could not die.
  
 Long had I lain thus, craving death,
 When quietly the earth beneath
 Gave way, and inch by inch, so great
 At last had grown the crushing weight,
 Into the earth I sank till I
 Full six feet under ground did lie,
 And sank no more,—there is no weight
 Can follow here, however great.
 From off my breast I felt it roll,
 And as it went my tortured soul
 Burst forth and fled in such a gust
 That all about me swirled the dust.
  
 Deep in the earth I rested now;
 Cool is its hand upon the brow
 And soft its breast beneath the head
 Of one who is so gladly dead.
 And all at once, and over all
 The pitying rain began to fall;
 I lay and heard each pattering hoof
 Upon my lowly, thatched roof,
 And seemed to love the sound far more
 Than ever I had done before.
 For rain it hath a friendly sound
 To one who's six feet underground;
 And scarce the friendly voice or face:
 A grave is such a quiet place.
  
 The rain, I said, is kind to come
 And speak to me in my new home.
 I would I were alive again
 To kiss the fingers of the rain,
 To drink into my eyes the shine
 Of every slanting silver line,
 To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze
 From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
 For soon the shower will be done,
 And then the broad face of the sun
 Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
 Until the world with answering mirth
 Shakes joyously, and each round drop
 Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.
  
 How can I bear it; buried here,
 While overhead the sky grows clear
 And blue again after the storm?
 O, multi-colored, multiform,
 Beloved beauty over me,
 That I shall never, never see
 Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold,
 That I shall never more behold!
 Sleeping your myriad magics through,
 Close-sepulchred away from you!
 O God, I cried, give me new birth,
 And put me back upon the earth!
 Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd
 And let the heavy rain, down-poured
 In one big torrent, set me free,
 Washing my grave away from me!
  
 I ceased; and through the breathless hush
 That answered me, the far-off rush
 Of herald wings came whispering
 Like music down the vibrant string
 Of my ascending prayer, and—crash!
 Before the wild wind's whistling lash
 The startled storm-clouds reared on high
 And plunged in terror down the sky,
 And the big rain in one black wave
 Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
  
 I know not how such things can be;
 I only know there came to me
 A fragrance such as never clings
 To aught save happy living things;
 A sound as of some joyous elf
 Singing sweet songs to please himself,
 And, through and over everything,
 A sense of glad awakening.
 The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,
 Whispering to me I could hear;
 I felt the rain's cool finger-tips
 Brushed tenderly across my lips,
 Laid gently on my sealed sight,
 And all at once the heavy night
 Fell from my eyes and I could see,—
 A drenched and dripping apple-tree,
 A last long line of silver rain,
 A sky grown clear and blue again.
 And as I looked a quickening gust
 Of wind blew up to me and thrust
 Into my face a miracle
 Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,—
 I know not how such things can be!—
 I breathed my soul back into me.
  
 Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
 And hailed the earth with such a cry
 As is not heard save from a man
 Who has been dead, and lives again.
 About the trees my arms I wound;
  
 Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
 I raised my quivering arms on high;
 I laughed and laughed into the sky,
 Till at my throat a strangling sob
 Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb
 Sent instant tears into my eyes;
 O God, I cried, no dark disguise
 Can e'er hereafter hide from me
 Thy radiant identity!
  
 Thou canst not move across the grass
 But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,
 Nor speak, however silently,
 But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
 I know the path that tells Thy way
 Through the cool eve of every day;
 God, I can push the grass apart
 And lay my finger on Thy heart!
  
 The world stands out on either side
 No wider than the heart is wide;
 Above the world is stretched the sky,—
 No higher than the soul is high.
 The heart can push the sea and land
 Farther away on either hand;
 The soul can split the sky in two,
 And let the face of God shine through.
 But East and West will pinch the heart
 That can not keep them pushed apart;
 And he whose soul is flat—the sky
 Will cave in on him by and by."
591,The Advance,Tom Sleigh,"1 

Out the barred window sandbags 
in a sagging wall surround the guard post 
where a soldier half-hidden by the flag 
holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost. 

It’s Sunday and quiet, the traffic noise 
off aways, the sea behind the post flat as the tarps 
pulled tight over the troop trucks. 
Somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys, 

telling some joke in Arabic 
in which I’m pretty sure I hear the word “zubrak”: 
I walk between shelves loaded with canned rations, 

the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room
while a pinned-up PSYOPS leaflet declares,
If you sleep in a cemetery, you’re bound to have nightmares.

No one sees the doll’s decapitated head small 
and neat in rubble. Never tired or sleepy, 
the head is its own country 
obstinately surviving, the pupil 

of   its one eye peering through the glass’s pure 
transparency. And a few feet away lie its slim, plastic, 
long-legged thighs almost like 
an obscenity the eye watches over —

no one in the street, nothing but bolt-marks
from tank-treads scarring the concrete 
to give any of   it drama — and what 

about the way the lips’ frozen smirk 
keeps daring me to touch the sexless V 
between the thighs staring up at me?

The barracks dissolve into a reef   of   rubble in the fog.
On either side of the road, crater after crater
flashes with glints of glass, plastic bags,
a chair leg clinging to a dismembered chair. 

The TV station, the power stacks 
thrusting up through mist, the black-bearded posters
and banners strung across 
the streets lead to an absolute nowhere:

all that’s left in the emptied town 
after the army pulled out are PSYOPS leaflets 
fluttering up around the car that winds 

down the coast road deeper into mist, headlights
probing like instruments in a wound
they illuminate the more they violate."

594,The Blessed Mother Complains to the Lord Her God on the Abundance of Brokenness She Receives,Mary Karr,"Today I heard a rich and hungry boy verbatim quote
all last night’s infomercials — an anorectic son
who bought with Daddy’s Amex black card
the Bowflex machine and Abdomenizer,
plus a steak knife that doth slice
the inner skin of   his starving arms.
Poor broken child of   Eve myself,
to me, the flightless fly,
the listing, blistered, scalded.
I am the rod to their lightning.
Mine is the earhole their stories pierce.
At my altar the blouse is torn open
and the buttons sailed across 
the incensed air space of the nave,
that I may witness the mastectomy scars 
crisscrossed like barbed wire, like bandoliers.
To me, the mother carries the ash contents
of   the long-ago incinerated girl.
She begs me for comfort since my own son
was worse tortured. Justice,
they wail for — mercy?
Each prostrate body I hold my arms out for
is a cross my son is nailed to."

Ten-thousand-count Egyptian cotton sheets. Intimacy with others,

Her single subject the idea that every single thing she loves

High editorial illusion of   “Control.” Early childhood: measles,

Of his second-wife’s pearl-satin slip, shimmering and still

The nature of  his wound was muscadine and terminal; he was easy

Some birds don’t migrate. Above, two lonely fowl
Scream across the sky their only vowel. 

This river I step in is not the river
I stand in. We’ll drive to Leslieville, wherever, 

Park in the Guildwood GO lot and get stoned.
Who’s there? Nay, answer me. Stand

And unfold yourself. Her heart begins to pound.
No geese go winging to the rooky pond

No goslings disappear their small and speckled. 
If we endure this, it will make us special."

600,Loony Bin Basketball,Mary Karr,"For Phil Jackson

The gym opened out 
before us like a vast arena, the bleached floorboards
yawned toward a vanishing point, staggered seats high
as the Mayan temple I once saw devoured by vines.
Each of us was eaten up inside — all citizens of   lost
             and unmapped cities.

Frank hugged the pimply ball
over his belly like an unborn child. Claire
dressed for daycare in daffodil yellow and jelly shoes.
David’s gaze was an emperor’s surveying a desiccated
battlefield. Since he viewed everything that way, we all
            saw him the same.

The psych techs in Cloroxed white
were giant angels who set us running drills, at which
we sucked. The zones we set out to defend were watery
at every edge. We missed close chest passes, easy combos. 
Our metronomes run different tempos, 
            John proclaimed. 

Then Claire started seeing 
dashes stutter through the air behind the ball.
Then speed lines on our backs, and then her own head 
went wobbly as a spinning egg. She’d once tracked
planetary orbits for NASA and now sat sidelined
            by her eyes’ projections. 

Only Bill had game.
Catatonic Bill whose normal talent was to schlub
days in a tub chair — his pudding face scarred
with chicken pox — using his hand for an ashtray,
belly for an armrest. Now all that peeled away, and he 
            emerged, clean as an egg.

 He was a lithe
and licorice boy, eeling past all comers, each shot
sheer net. He faked both ways, went left. Beneath the orange 
rim his midair pirouettes defied the gravity that I
could barely sludge through. He scored beyond what even
             Claire could count,

then he bent panting,
hands on knees as the orderlies held out water cups,
and the rest of us reached to pat his back or slap
his sweaty hand, no one minding about the stench or his 
breath like old pennies. Then as quick as that
             he went.

Inside his head
some inner winch did reel him back from the front
of   his face bones where he’d been ablaze. He went back and 
back into that shadowed stare. Lucky we were to breathe
his air. Breath is God’s intent to keep us living. He was
             the self   I’d come in

wanting to kill, and I left him there."

Caught in a banjo.

Peek-a-boo. A study in

Of   the chimney in night wind.
That flat daffodil.

With absurd hauteur
New tulips dab their shadows
In water-mutter.

Boys are such oxen.

And give us our
asses as we forgive those
who ass against us.
And speed us not
into wimp nation
nor bequiver us

and the same fucking
story in leather 
for never and ever. 
Ah: gin."
603,Ovid on Climate Change,Eliza Griswold,"Bastard, the other boys teased him,
till Phaethon unleashed the steeds 
of Armageddon. He couldn’t hold 
their reins. Driving the sun too close 
to earth, the boy withered rivers, 
torched Eucalyptus groves, until the hills 
burst into flame, and the people’s blood 
boiled through the skin. Ethiopia,
land of   burnt faces. In a boy’s rage 
for a name, the myth of race begins."
604,"Parkdale, then Princess Street",Michael Lista,"Make them say yes before you even ask,
L’essence de charme, c’est ça. The mind’s a damsel
Locked in a tower with her fathom of   hair.
Coax the braid and it’ll all be over. 

The rooms are plain where I am interviewed,
Abstract and clinical, and so I glory 
Like a corpse plant, perfume the marble-faced
With the reek and prodigy of my tomorrows. 

Dying is so boring as the soul
Rummages the liquidation sale
For a final bargain —

But time outbids all comers, and we die
Expensively in Princess Margaret
Who was herself once so beautiful."
605,A Perfect Mess,Mary Karr,"For David Freedman

I read somewhere
that if pedestrians didn’t break traffic laws to cross
Times Square whenever and by whatever means possible,
       the whole city
would stop, it would stop.
Cars would back up to Rhode Island,
an epic gridlock not even a cat
could thread through. It’s not law but the sprawl
of our separate wills that keeps us all flowing. Today I loved
the unprecedented gall
of the piano movers, shoving a roped-up baby grand
up Ninth Avenue before a thunderstorm.
They were a grim and hefty pair, cynical
as any day laborers. They knew what was coming,
the instrument white lacquered, the sky bulging black
as a bad water balloon and in one pinprick instant
it burst. A downpour like a fire hose.
For a few heartbeats, the whole city stalled,
paused, a heart thump, then it all went staccato.
And it was my pleasure to witness a not
insignificant miracle: in one instant every black
umbrella in Hell’s Kitchen opened on cue, everyone
still moving. It was a scene from an unwritten opera,
the sails of some vast armada.
And four old ladies interrupted their own slow progress
to accompany the piano movers.
each holding what might have once been
lace parasols over the grunting men. I passed next
the crowd of pastel ballerinas huddled
under the corner awning,
in line for an open call — stork-limbed, ankles
zigzagged with ribbon, a few passing a lit cigarette
around. The city feeds on beauty, starves
for it, breeds it. Coming home after midnight,
to my deserted block with its famously high
subway-rat count, I heard a tenor exhale pure
longing down the brick canyons, the steaming moon
opened its mouth to drink from on high ..."
606,Ruins,Eliza Griswold,"A spring day oozes through Trastevere. 
A nun in turquoise sneakers contemplates the stairs. 
Ragazzi everywhere, the pus in their pimples 
pushing up like paperwhites in the midday sun. 

Every hard bulb stirs. 

The fossilized egg in my chest 
cracks open against my will. 

I was so proud not to feel my heart.
Waking means being angry.

The dead man on the Congo road 
was missing an ear, 
which had either been eaten 
or someone was wearing it 
around his neck. 

The dead man looked like this. No, that. 

Here’s a flock of tourists
in matching canvas hats. 
This year will take from me
the hardened person 
who I longed to be. 
I am healing by mistake. 
Rome is also built on ruins."
607,The Scarborough Grace,Michael Lista,"An old man on Grace Street is going mad
In a Canadian T-shirt he won’t change
And red unwrinkling pants I thought had made
Him stylish when I met him in the spring —

Five or six times a day I see him walk
Down Grace Street to St. Francis church, and knock
And pull its wooden doors, always shocked
That his entitled holy place is locked. 

Undreams Damascus from a baffled Paul,
Rolls back the road where some unstricken Saul
Rises up, as bubbles through a beer
To a surface where we disappear 

And wake in some uncalendared forever,
An unwelcome Elijah passing over."

Truck a passel (a poke) of wildling boys

Upcountry — loosed from mothers

Pale (pink-backed) tobacco-crew

Most nights the boy they called Tynan
suppered us with scrapple from a can. Or some black-eyes
he’d’ve road-begged; a quarter-peck of crowders
scrounged off vines.

The broad back-skin on the tallest boy
   —a (spreading) welt-weave, a lattice.

Last good gloam-minute after work
we’d strip off there in the side-yard, yawping; taking turns
de-tarring      un-burning
arc-aiming cool hose-spray each on each.

Eleven of us / chigger-scritches, scablets.
Eleven of us / none of us clean.

Where the boss of us bore down
on us — our rank of   bedrolls on the floorboards — one and
one and one, eleven of us — ranked sack-beds
on floorboards — boots of — black breath of — the boss

of us bearing down on us — ain’t none
 of us (not a one of us) clean.

           And so (the heaving) boys got trucked to CANDY'S STOP
up Hwy. 52 one night and dumped."
609,Three Poems after Yannis Ritsos,David Harsent,"REVERSALS 

There are graves under the houses and houses 
under the graves and linking the three 

a broad stone staircase where the dead
go up and the living go down. They pass one another

wordlessly which might mean they don’t know, or else
they’re pretending not to know. You can smell

the orange grove on the hill; you can hear
children bowling barrel hoops down the street. 

Two women gossip as they fill their jug at the spring.
Their secrets cloud the water. 

Later they walk back through an avenue 
of   cypresses, carrying the jug like a bastard child.

 TRAPPED 

In the house across the street, in a room
directly opposite his, was a long mirror. When he looked 

out of   his window, he would see himself   in the room
like a thief caught in a trap. He threw a stone.

His neighbor ran in to the sound of   breaking glass,
then came to the window and shouted across: 

“Thank God for that: whenever I looked in my mirror 
there you were, doing something shifty behind my back.” 

The first man turned away. The long mirror in his room 
brought him face to face with his neighbor, knife in hand.

 THE ACCUSED 

Just as he locked the door, as he pocketed the key, 
as he glanced over his shoulder, they arrested him. 
They tortured him until they tired of   it. 
                                                                         “Look,” they said, 
“the key is your key, the house is your house, 
we accept that now; but why did you put the key 
in your pocket as if to hide it from us?”

They let him go, but his name is still on a list."

611,Today’s Special,Michael Lista,"Well I guess that’s all locked up tight 
Says Sam who guards the mall at night. 

Sam’s a puppet! He can’t use his eyes.
His body is an excellent disguise. 

I’m Muffy the Mouse! I’m condemned to rhyme
Until the Christmas special end of time. 

That’s Jodi, my human friend.
The world goes on and on and will not end

Hiya there Jodi. Oh hi Sam. 
Jodi straightens Jeffrey’s magic tam. 

Everything’s safe here let’s go upstairs
Sam says through a moustache Props repairs. 

Jodi is so pretty. I hate her. 
She carries Jeffrey up the escalator

To the kid’s department every night
Where he turns into space and starlight 

When I say the magic rhyme. Jeff’s a mannequin 
Until the mall goes dark. Then he’s a man again."

613,The Afterlife,Roy Fisher,"I’ve lived within half a mile of it
for twenty years. West
by the black iron weather-hen
half-strangled with clematis
on the garage roof
I can locate it. Past a low ridge
in the cliff face of a limestone dale
there’s a cave in the bushes.
 
When the old tigers
were long since gone, leaving their
teeth, the valley people
would climb there with the dead
they thought most useful;
 
push them well in,
 
take them out again,
walk them around:
‘They’re coming! They’re coming’
 
            We Malagasies love
             our second burials.
             We hire a band that comes
             in a van. Again
             with liquefaction almost done
             we hold our cherished ones
             in our arms. From the grave-clothes
             they fall in gobbets as dog-food
             falls from the can. We wrap them
             in fresh dry linen. They
             bless our lives with their happiness.
 
Walk them around the valley. Drop
here a finger
for the god that is a rat or a raven,
here a metatarsal
to set under the hearth for luck.
 
And what was luck?
 
The afterlife back then
was fairly long:
nothing demented like for ever,
 
nothing military. The afterlife
would come to the party."
614,Provision,Roy Fisher,"The irritations of comfort—
I visit as they rebuild the house
from within: whitening, straightening,
bracing the chimney-breast edges
and forcing warmth, dryness
and windows with views into
the cottage below canal-level.
 
For yes, there’s a canal, bringing
cold reflections almost to the door,
and beyond it the main line to Manchester,
its grid of gantries pale
against the upland and the sky;
there’s a towpath pub, where the red-
haired old landlady
brings up the beer from the cellar slowly
in a jug: there’s a chapel
next door to the cottage, set up
with a false front and a real
boiler-house, and—
rest, my mind—nearby there’s
a small haulage contractor’s yard.
 
Everything’s turned up here, except
a certain complete cast-iron
housefront, preserved and pinned
to a blank wall in Ottawa.
 
This comfort
beckons. It won’t do. It beckons.
Driving steadily through rain in
a watertight car with the wipers going.
It won’t do. It beckons."
615,The Thing about Joe Sullivan,Roy Fisher,"The pianist Joe Sullivan,
jamming sound against idea
 
hard as it can go
florid and dangerous
 
slams at the beat, or hovers,
drumming, along its spikes;
 
in his time almost the only
one of them to ignore
 
the chance of easing down,
walking it leisurely,
 
he’ll strut, with gambling shapes,
underpinning by James P.,
 
amble, and stride over
gulfs of his own leaving, perilously
 
toppling octaves down to where
the chords grow fat again
 
and ride hard-edged, most lucidly
voiced, and in good inversions even when
 
the piano seems at risk of being
hammered the next second into scrap.
 
For all that, he won’t swing
like all the others;
 
disregards mere continuity,
the snakecharming business,
 
the ‘masturbator’s rhythm’
under the long variations:
 
Sullivan can gut a sequence
in one chorus—
 
—approach, development, climax, discard—
and sound magnanimous.
 
The mannerism of intensity
often with him seems true,
 
too much to be said, the mood
pressing in right at the start, then
 
running among stock forms
that could play themselves
 
and moving there with such
quickness of intellect
 
that shapes flaw and fuse,
altering without much sign,
 
concentration
so wrapped up in thoroughness
 
it can sound bluff, bustling,
just big-handed stuff—
 
belied by what drives him in
to make rigid, display,
 
shout and abscond, rather
than just let it come, let it go—
 
And that thing is his mood:
a feeling violent and ordinary
 
that runs in among standard forms so
wrapped up in clarity
 
that fingers following his
through figures that sound obvious
 
find corners everywhere,
marks of invention, wakefulness;
 
the rapid and perverse
tracks that ordinary feelings
 
make when they get driven
hard enough against time."
616,At the New Year,Kenneth Patchen,"In the shape of this night, in the still fall
        of snow, Father
In all that is cold and tiny, these little birds
        and children
In everything that moves tonight, the trolleys
        and the lovers, Father
In the great hush of country, in the ugly noise
        of our cities
In this deep throw of stars, in those trenches
        where the dead are, Father
In all the wide land waiting, and in the liners
        out on the black water
In all that has been said bravely, in all that is
        mean anywhere in the world, Father
In all that is good and lovely, in every house
        where sham and hatred are
In the name of those who wait, in the sound
        of angry voices, Father
Before the bells ring, before this little point in time
        has rushed us on
Before this clean moment has gone, before this night
        turns to face tomorrow, Father
There is this high singing in the air
Forever this sorrowful human face in eternity’s window
And there are other bells that we would ring, Father
Other bells that we would ring."
617,The Entertainment of War,Roy Fisher,"I saw the garden where my aunt had died
And her two children and a woman from next door;
It was like a burst pod filled with clay.
 
A mile away in the night I had heard the bombs
Sing and then burst themselves between cramped houses
With bright soft flashes and sounds like banging doors;
 
The last of them crushed the four bodies into the ground,
Scattered the shelter, and blasted my uncle’s corpse
Over the housetop and into the street beyond.
 
Now the garden lay stripped and stale; the iron shelter
Spread out its separate petals around a smooth clay saucer.
Small, and so tidy it seemed nobody had ever been there.
 
When I saw it, the house was blown clean by blast and care.
Relations had already torn out the new fireplaces;
My cousin’s pencils lasted me several years.
 
And in his office notepad that was given me
I found solemn drawings in crayon of blondes without dresses.
In his lifetime I had not known him well.
 
These were the things I noticed at ten years of age:
Those, and the four hearses outside our house,
The chocolate cakes, and my classmates’ half-shocked envy.
 
But my grandfather went home from the mortuary
And for five years tried to share the noises in his skull,
Then he walked out and lay under a furze-bush to die.
 
When my father came back from identifying the daughter
He asked us to remind him of her mouth.
We tried. He said ‘I think it was the one’.
 
These were marginal people I had met only rarely
And the end of the whole household meant that no grief was seen;
Never have people seemed so absent from their own deaths.
 
This bloody episode of four whom I could understand better dead
Gave me something I needed to keep a long story moving;
I had no pain of it; can find no scar even now.
 
But had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up
I might, in the sigh and strike of the next night’s bombs
Have realized a little what they meant, and for the first time been afraid."
618,The Heavenly City,Stevie Smith,"I sigh for the heavenly country,
Where the heavenly people pass,
And the sea is as quiet as a mirror
Of beautiful beautiful glass.
 
I walk in the heavenly field,
With lilies and poppies bright,
I am dressed in a heavenly coat
Of polished white.
 
When I walk in the heavenly parkland
My feet on the pasture are bare,
Tall waves the grass, but no harmful
Creature is there.
 
At night I fly over the housetops,
And stand on the bright moony beams;
Gold are all heaven’s rivers,
And silver her streams."
619,Painted Eyes,Henri Cole,"Dusty and treeless, the street sloped beneath us.
Somewhere a hammer made thunderclaps,
forging the night-sky.
 
                                       Then the children,
seeing us, dashed from the Moorish houses,
vigorously shouting, vying for position,
while the bravest,
in worn underpants and plastic sandals,
climbed a high crater-like wall
and plunged, with murderous cries,
into the Roman pool
where blue-lipped fish waited.
Ah, those glorious soaked heads, spiked like palm fronds!
Seeing one in our group clutch her purse—
repelled by the wet black princes
who shivered in circles of yellow mud
and begged from us—
I felt ashamed.
In the brief African twilight,
a canary chirped something
shrewdly about avarice.
 
Far off, in the little neighborhood
where I grew—with neat cement walkways
and crab-apple blossoms—
money ran through the fingers
of our house, with nothing much
to record its loss but unhappiness:
one of us ironing servilely,
one of us sobbing in a bedroom,
one of us sleeping on a rifle,
one of us seizing another by the hair,
demanding the animal-like submission
we thought was love.
 
                                       Sunday evening.
Mother is wearing a big cotton shift
and tweezing her eyebrows.
Her head is a thicket of hairpins.
In the round hand-mirror
that parodies her face,
the world looks greater than it is.
I am next to bathe in the water
of the poor earth, reused by each of us
in order of birth. Gray with sodium and grit,
it covers me like a black robe,
and yet I feel exalted.
 
                                       Soon the violent rain,
like wet Sahara sand, would fall,
scrubbing the hot labyrinthine
corridors of shuttered houses and aimless dogs,
where the sparse life is
purgative and inexhaustible,
where little pilfering hands
moved freely in and out
of my trouser pockets,
though there were no diamonds
except those the eyes mined."
620,Saint Stephen’s Day with the Griffins,Henri Cole,"for Janet and Christopher

     Half-eagle, half-lion, the fabulous
          animal struts, saber-clawed but saintly,
   a candlewicked ornament dangling
from our rickety sugar pine. Butternut
 
     pudding in our bellies. His reindeer
          and sleigh hurried here and gone—thank God
     for us childless folks. Almost:   the lovelocked
Griffins on the sofa, sockfooted, hearing
 
     gas and a kiddy heart in her tummy—
          a life more imaginary than real,
     though one is dazzled by gold that fills
the egg unbroken. We feed her crumpets
 
     and listen again: The lamb’s a hungry
          bugger, even snug from earth’s
     imponderable fury. Tomorrow, in a spurt
by jet I’m home. Clumsy as a puppy
 
     I’ll scale the flightstairs into the nosecone,
          luggage banging at my sides, enter the egg-
     shaped cabin and await the infrared
climb toward space. Tell me one
 
     thing true? If I could count the way
          things slip from us: Mother’s fur gloves,
     Sunday’s benediction, the dead gone before us,
love’s rambler on the prairie—all displaced
 
     as we buckle in our shuttle,
          jetbound on a screaming runway,
     gravity pulling at us castaways,
more mammal than bird, subtle
 
     leg-weary griffins made manifest,
          arrowing towards home. How do we
     ignore it: the attenuated being
of our age, the bittersweet collapse
 
     of dominoes mooned around our pine?
           Withered with hatred from his quarter,
     Saint Stephen even at death rolled mercifully over
in high holiness. Sonless, wifeless, nine
 
     thousand feet from land, I roll the lozenge
          on my tongue, youthful habit for ache
     of any kind, parting a survivor (Wait!),
love rescuing me from the fringe."
621,This One’s for You,Jan Heller Levi,"Even if you didn’t have green eyes (in the bathtub, blue).
Even if you didn’t have a lovely singing voice,
            or care for Alexandrine champagne
            some slow Saturday evenings to sing it through,
it pleases me, your lips close to my ear,
            or when you’re a big girl, and I’m a big girl too.
 
Five years difference between we two.
Sometimes it hardly matters. I’ve decided to worship you,
            Diana, goddess of the forest—
            or is she the one of the hunt?
            Who cares? You remind me of her
too. Some woman caught me up, breathless, in her strong arms,
            said breathe, darling. Her eyes were green-blue.
 
Vague resemblances: that’s the daily news.
Meaning: I’m willingly a fool for you
            any hour past midnight,
            and almost anytime in three-quarter view.
            Consider this, too: stumbling back, after a fight,
to someplace we could call home, you and I have been known
            to duet a jubilee so funky it sounds like the blues.
 
What steady arrows you shoot, Diana, become
a goddess of the hearth: you whisper
            time to put the porchlight on,
             and we do. Who am I talking to?
What is this strange glare, this prescience that you won’t be true?
Sometimes you say something like even so, boo,
and it sounds like breathe, darling. That’s why this one’s for you."
622,This Place Rumord to Have Been Sodom,Robert Duncan,"might have been.
Certainly these ashes might have been pleasures.
Pilgrims on their way to the Holy Places remark
this place. Isn’t it plain to all
that these mounds were palaces? This was once
a city among men, a gathering together of spirit.
It was measured by the Lord and found wanting.
  
It was measured by the Lord and found wanting,
destroyd by the angels that inhabit longing.
Surely this is Great Sodom where such cries
as if men were birds flying up from the swamp
ring in our ears, where such fears that were once
desires walk, almost spectacular,
stalking the desolate circles, red eyed.
  
This place rumord to have been a City surely was,
separated from us by the hand of the Lord.
The devout have laid out gardens in the desert,
drawn water from springs where the light was blighted.
How tenderly they must attend these friendships
or all is lost. All is lost.
Only the faithful hold this place green.
  
Only the faithful hold this place green
where the crown of fiery thorns descends.
Men that once lusted grow listless. A spirit
wrappd in a cloud, ashes more than ashes,
fire more than fire, ascends.
Only these new friends gather joyous here,
where the world like Great Sodom lies under fear.
  
 The world like Great Sodom lies under Love
 and knows not the hand of the Lord that moves.
This the friends teach where such cries
as if men were birds fly up from the crowds
gatherd and howling in the heat of the sun.
In the Lord Whom the friends have named at last Love
the images and loves of the friends never die.
This place rumord to have been Sodom is blessd
in the Lord’s eyes."
623,Waiting for This Story to End Before I Begin Another,Jan Heller Levi,"All my stories are about being left,
all yours about leaving. So we should have known.
Should have known to leave well enough alone;
we knew, and we didn’t. You said let’s put
our cards on the table, your card
was your body, the table my bed, where we didn’t
get till 4 am, so tired from wanting
what we shouldn’t that when we finally found our heads,
we’d lost our minds. Love, I wanted to call you
so fast. But so slow you could taste each
letter licked into your particular and rose-like ear.
 L, love, for let’s wait. O, for oh no, let’s not. V
for the precious v between your deep breasts
(and the virtue of your fingers
in the voluptuous center of me.)
 
Okay, E for enough.
 
Dawn broke, or shattered. Once we’ve made
the promises, it’s hard to add the prefix if. . . .
But not so wrong to try.
That means taking a lot of walks,
which neither of us is good at,
for different reasons, and nights up till 2
arguing whose reasons are better.
Time and numbers count a lot in this. 13
years my marriage. 5 years you my friend.
4th of July weekend when something that begins
in mist, by mistake (whose?), means too much
has to end. I think we need an abacus to get our love
on course, and one of us to oil the shining rods
so we can keep the crazy beads clicking,
clicking. It wasn’t a question
of a perfect fit. Theoretically,
it should be enough to say I left a man
for a woman (90% of the world is content
to leave it at that. Oh, lazy world) and when the woman
lost her nerve, I left
for greater concerns: when words like autonomy
were useful, I used them, I confess. So I get
what I deserve: a studio apartment he paid the rent on;
bookshelves up to the ceiling she drove
the screws for. And a skylight I sleep alone
beneath, and two shiny quarters in my pocket
to call one, then the other, or to call one
 
twice. Once, twice, I threatened to leave him—
remember? Now that I’ve done it, he says
he doesn’t. I’m in a phonebooth at the corner of Bank
and Greenwich; not a booth, exactly,
but two sheets of glass to shiver between.
This is called being street-smart: dialing
a number that you know won’t be answered,
but the message you leave leaves proof that you tried.
And this, my two dearly beloveds, is this called
hedging your bets? I fish out my other
coin, turn it over in my fingers, press
it into the slot. Hold it there. Let it drop."
624,Ligature,Forrest Gander,"When the strong drag of the boy’s adolescence pulls through them, the


family rises into thinness and begins to break like a wave.


 


You turned away when I kissed you, the woman says. Why?


 


Half-lidded days of early winter.


 


When he points toward the woman, the boy looks at his hand the way dogs


will.


 


The boy’s jaw sets. As though behind his teeth, into the soft flesh of his


throat, a new set of teeth were cutting through. A mouth for what?


 


Each of them adopts a private view. Arguments veer every which way, and


who can follow? A sequence of dark non sequiturs blows in.


 


When one, when one word, when the word suicide enters the room where


they are shouting, the system closes down, prematurely becalmed.


 


The man writes, I am not given a subject but am given to my subject. I


am inside it like a parasite.


 


He sees the woman’s face contract at the approach of other futures than the


one for which her face was prepared.


 


So they inhabit their bodies like music, for a given time. And yet he


continues to act as if there were times to come.


 


I just want you to go away, one of them screams.


 


Expressionless and flat as a tortilla, the afternoon moon over their house.


 


She calls the man to a corner in the basement. Those aren’t spider eggs, he


says, backing up. Those are its eyes.


 


When the encounter with the self is volcanic, nothing can follow.


 


Tearing open the cocoon to reveal itself, a boy within the family.


 


As if they were waiting. As if inside experience, bright with meaning,


there were another experience pendant, unnameable."
625,Ligature 4,Forrest Gander,"The bioluminescent undersides of squid render them invisible to predators


below. That the radiance of the boy’s anger might protect him.


 


Walking the dog and stepping on a patch of repaired road, I remember the


soft spot in his head.


 


You’re deaf as a beagle. No, you are.


 


Can I feel the tide’s drag on the turning earth increase each day’s duration?


 


A hair in my nostril has gone white.


 


In absolute night, from my bed, I hear him aiming for the toilet’s center.


The sound deepens, voice finding its register.


 


Scientists call it an entangled system.


 


We survive Christmas, his face pressed to the smooshed bosom of his


grandmother in a house so immaculate, the spider in the seam of the


ceiling stands out obscenely.


 


Like a star at the outskirts of the galaxy, and slung around by the gravity of


dark matter. For now, he goes where we go, but he does not belong to us.


 


I begin to begin my sentences leaning toward him, taking a deep breath.


 


He relinquishes the conversation with a contraction of his pupils.


 


What is for one of us the throb of the immediate is, for the other, the


imminent mundane.


 


When napalm hits my brain, he takes on the tranquillity of a blinking


newt.


 


She finds a photograph of him at seven. The sheer 
expressed
 of his face. As


among Michelangelo’s early drawings, there is a copy of Masacchio’s lost

Sagra
, the consecration.

 


We search our memories of him for a certain unity of characteristics that


would hold through the permutations he now submits to us.

 


When it clings to the wire-and-rug surrogate, lab technicians shock it


again. Instead of releasing, it clings tighter.

 


Throwing himself into the back seat after wrestling practice, mat burns on


his cheek and forehead.

 


His muteness an onomatopoeia of the rising moon."

                               vertiginous air down its throat—
                                                                                           to snatch him
                                                                    from the scarp."

628,Voiced Stops,Forrest Gander,"Summer’s sweet theatrum! The boy lunges through
The kitchen without comment, slams the door. An
Elaborate evening drama. I lug his forlorn weight
From floor to bed. Beatific lips and gap-
 
Toothed. Who stayed late to mope and swim, then
Breach chimneys of lake like a hooked gar
Pressing his wet totality against me. Iridescent
Laughter and depraved. Chromatic his constant state. At
 
Ten, childhood took off like a scorched dog. Turned
His head to see my hand wave from a window, and I too saw
The hand untouching, distant from. What fathering-
Fear slaked the impulse to embrace him? Duration!
 
An indefinite continuation of life. I whirled out wings. Going
Toward. And Lord Child claimed now, climbing loose."
629,Walking Parker Home,Bob Kaufman,"Sweet beats of jazz impaled on slivers of wind
Kansas Black Morning/ First Horn Eyes/
Historical sound pictures on New Bird wings
People shouts/ boy alto dreams/ Tomorrow’s
Gold belled pipe of stops and future Blues Times
Lurking Hawkins/ shadows of Lester/ realization
Bronze fingers—brain extensions seeking trapped sounds
Ghetto thoughts/ bandstand courage/ solo flight
Nerve-wracked suspicions of newer songs and doubts
New York alter city/ black tears/ secret disciples
Hammer horn pounding soul marks on unswinging gates
Culture gods/ mob sounds/ visions of spikes
Panic excursions to tribal Jazz wombs and transfusions
Heroin nights of birth/ and soaring/ over boppy new ground.
Smothered rage covering pyramids of notes spontaneously exploding
Cool revelations/ shrill hopes/ beauty speared into greedy ears
Birdland nights on bop mountains, windy saxophone revolutions.
Dayrooms of junk/ and melting walls and circling vultures/
Money cancer/ remembered pain/ terror flights/
Death and indestructible existence
  
In that Jazz corner of life
Wrapped in a mist of sound
His legacy, our Jazz-tinted dawn
Wailing his triumphs of oddly begotten dreams
Inviting the nerveless to feel once more
That fierce dying of humans consumed
In raging fires of Love."
630,A Farewell,Harriet Monroe,"Good-bye!—no, do not grieve that it is over,
   The perfect hour;
That the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover,
   Flits from the flower.

Grieve not—it is the law. Love will be flying—
   Yes, love and all.
Glad was the living—blessed be the dying.
   Let the leaves fall."
631,To C,Forrest Gander,"Inside, inside the return, inside, the hero diminishes.
Over her vessel they place a veil, and when it is lifted
the name of the vessel has been lost. Consider
the darkness of the water which has no scent
and neither can it swallow. Yet the ship’s bow
extends over the proscenium like a horse
at a fence and the orchestra stands and files out.
On the long walk home, I long to see your face."
632,Conduct,Samuel Greenberg,"By a peninsula the painter sat and
 Sketched the uneven valley groves.
 The apostle gave alms to the
 Meek. The volcano burst
 In fusive sulphur and hurled 
 Rocks and ore into the air—
 Heaven’s sudden change at
 The drawing tempestuous,
 Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.
 The wanderer soon chose
 His spot of rest; they bore the 
 Chosen hero upon their shoulders,
 Whom they strangely admired, as
 The beach-tide summer of people desired."
633,East River’s Charm,Samuel Greenberg,"Is this the river East I heard?—
 Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred
 And the reaching wharves from the inner land
 Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand—
  
 And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud
 Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed
 From the rays of the morning sun
 Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.
  
 But look at the depth of the drippling tide
 The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;
 As the boat turns upon the silvery spread
 It leaves—strange—a shadow dead.
  
 And the very charms from the reflective river
 And from the stacks of the floating boat—
 There seemeth the quality ne’er to dissever
 Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke."
634,The Glass Bubbles,Samuel Greenberg,"The motion of gathering loops of water
 Must either burst or remain in a moment.
 The violet colors through the glass
 Throw up little swellings that appear
 And spatter as soon as another strikes
 And is born; so pure are they of colored
 Hues, that we feel the absent strength
 Of its power. When they begin they gather
 Like sand on the beach: each bubble
 Contains a complete eye of water."
635,The Grand Army of the Republic,John Spaulding,"When the soldiers came in their dirty blue shirts
I was kneeling in the garden in the rain.
That year only a few ramblers were left
and the trellis had collapsed from the wind.
Still I was glad for the water and darkness that clotted the air;
the days had seemed sour to me in spite of
the glory of the vegetables wandering into fall,
the fat swollen apples and the wild roses
creeping under the lilac. And there, as the men approached,
I stood up near the two willow saplings
sprouted from posts but driven in,
the larger one, by the neighbor boy
when he entered service, the smaller one
when he returned home. I could see
the street from where I stood, as though wrapped
in gauze, heavy with the nests of caterpillars.
(Next week a man with rags tied to sticks
would dip them in kerosene and
burn the worms that would then drop
squirming onto his arms, his hair, the street.)
And then I thought I was lying at the bottom of a pond
edged with grayish leaves and looking up to the surface.
I saw leaves, raindrops shattering the sky
like splinters of glass drifting toward my body;
noises seemed echoes as I continued to distance myself
from what had happened. After that
a disbelief, perhaps I had had a stroke, hit my head,
or fallen asleep and woke to flies banging against my face.
I saw edges of myself being flattened by rain,
could smell the earth too and thought of the years
of rot that made the smell, the rot of my father and his father
and all those who had gone before and how we eat the root
of the earth and then turn into rot ourselves just as
pieces of dirt were grinding away between my teeth and tongue,
my bit of gristle being stirred into earth’s stew.
I began to raise my head and noticed
for the first time the bunting,
red, white, and blue, hung out for the parade."
636,Harvest of Death,John Spaulding,"(Civil War Photography by T. O’Sullivan, 1866)

Raisin-black blood dries on their faces.
Thick wool clothes.
Lumps of bloated bodies
lying on their backs.
 
Mouths open. Chins
pointing to the sky.
As though blown over backward.
Or turned.
 
Fingers swollen.
Boots and rifles missing.
Coats and jackets pulled up
exposing gray shirts, bloody underwear.
 
The sky drifts toward sap green.
No fences. No stone walls."
637,I Was Just Frosted,Susan Wheeler,"Thanks, Ray, this is just what the doctor ordered.
 
     No, you never see me have one with olives—your father likes
olives but I can’t stand them.
 
     No, cocktail onions are just picked small. Turn that down, Dan.
 
            Avocados, toothpicks. Coleus, root sprawl.
            The diffident glints of a late-day sun, rays
            splintered by leaves: they shake and, in their
            shaking, streak the light. Transparent murk
            of glasses at the glass.
 
     Would you move just one inch over? There. The light was in my eye."
638,She’s a Pill,Susan Wheeler,"Oh, dangling long sleeves in the Mercurochrome.
            Parking her punch on her knees.
 
     I’m not a joiner.
 
            In the night, a visitation, small as a thumb,
            enters the sealed house and ascends.
 
     Mother wouldn’t have stood for that long. Drippy-drooping around
on heels. Leaving the blue cheese out."
639,"Timothy O’Sullivan, Photographer",John Spaulding,"He could have stayed in the city,
photographed the cheese and oyster boys after the war,
opal-colored orphans or ladies of unfortunate standing,
back when tall buildings still believed in America,
back when concrete was still a thing of splendor.
Instead he went West to rehabilitate his grief.
 
Always the white sky.
Always the dark figures lost in an immense world
full of danger and disaster, starvation and storms
of mosquitoes thick enough to snuff out candles.
Provisions lost in a blazing sun that watched
constantly. Twice hit by shell fragments,
once by tuberculosis.
Dead at 42.
 
The fortunate thing about his camera
was its ability to stray—
to put things in that didn’t belong,
like footprints in the sand.
Here is the photographer and his party
exploring the great canyons of the West
while their clothes dry on the line."
640,The White Train,John Spaulding,"The white train emerges from a dark curtain
of tall fir trees with its coat of light snow.
The white train appears as though newly escaped
from the jaws of night. The white train steams
out of the forest into the clear white
meadow, melting the fresh snow around it.
 
The trees are towering. Ancient giants.
A whole section seems to have been logged.
Over there the folded arms of soldiers who
gather in small groups. We cannot see
leaders or individual faces. Horsemen far away.
On their way to the revolution perhaps.
 
In the dining car, behind the velvet curtains—
blood puddings and sea pie, clear soups
and small marrow. Already today
the chef has cooked three luncheons
while crossing Poland; the starched
waiters managed without spilling a drop.
 
Dozens of dirty white napkins heap on hampers
like miniature Alps threatening to fall. But
now the train has braked and stopped. Small boys
fog the windows with their warm breath
as they watch the soldiers with silver sabers who
order everyone off the train, into the new snow."
641,Army of Occupation,Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,"At Arlington, 1866

The summer blew its little drifts of sound—
     Tangled with wet leaf-shadows and the light
 Small breath of scattered morning buds—around
 The yellow path through which our footsteps wound.
     Below, the Capitol rose glittering white.
  
 There stretched a sleeping army. One by one,
     They took their places until thousands met;
 No leader’s stars flashed on before, and none
 Leaned on his sword or stagger’d with his gun—
     I wonder if their feet have rested yet!
  
 They saw the dust, they joined the moving mass,
     They answer’d the fierce music’s cry for blood,
 Then straggled here and lay down in the grass:—
 Wear flowers for such, shores whence their feet did pass;
     Sing tenderly; O river’s haunted flood!
  
 They had been sick, and worn, and weary, when
     They stopp’d on this calm hill beneath the trees:
 Yet if, in some red-clouded dawn, again
 The country should be calling to her men,
     Shall the r[e]veill[e] not remember these?
  
 Around them underneath the mid-day skies
     The dreadful phantoms of the living walk,
 And by low moons and darkness with their cries—
 The mothers, sisters, wives with faded eyes,
     Who call still names amid their broken talk.
  
 And there is one who comes alone and stands
     At his dim fireless hearth—chill’d and oppress’d
 By Something he had summon’d to his lands,
 While the weird pallor of its many hands
     Points to his rusted sword in his own breast!"
642,The Black Regiment,George Henry Boker,"Dark as the clouds of even,
 Ranked in the western heaven,
 Waiting the breath that lifts
 All the dread mass, and drifts
 Tempest and falling brand
 Over a ruined land;—
 So still and orderly,
 Arm to arm, knee to knee,
 Waiting the great event,
 Stands the Black Regiment.
  
 Down the long dusky line
 Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine;
 And the bright bayonet,
 Bristling and firmly set,
 Flashed with a purpose grand,
 Long ere the sharp command
 Of the fierce rolling drum
 Told them their time had come,
 Told them what work was sent
 For the Black Regiment.
  
 “Now,” the flag-sergeant cried,
 “Though death and hell betide,
 Let the whole nation see
 If we are fit to be
 Free in this land; or bound
 Down, like the whining hound,—
 Bound with red stripes of pain
 In our old chains again!”
 Oh, what a shout there went
 From the Black Regiment!
  
 “Charge!” Trump and drum awoke,
 Onward the bondmen broke;
 Bayonet and sabre-stroke
 Vainly opposed their rush.
 Through the wild battle’s crush,
 With but one thought aflush,
 Driving their lords like chaff,
 In the guns’ mouths they laugh;
 Or at the slippery brands
 Leaping with open hands,
 Down they tear man and horse,
 Down in their awful course;
 Tramping with bloody heel
 Over the crashing steel,
 All their eyes forward bent,
 Rushed the Black Regiment.
  
 “Freedom!” their battle-cry—
 “Freedom! or leave to die!”
 Ah! And they meant the word,
 Not as with us ’tis heard,
 Not a mere party shout:
 They gave their spirits out;
 Trusted the end to God,
 And on the gory sod
 Rolled in triumphant blood.
  
 Glad to strike one free blow,
 Whether for weal or woe;
 Glad to breathe one free breath,
 Though on the lips of death.
 Praying—alas! in vain!—
 That they might fall again,
 So they could once more see
 That burst to liberty!
 This was what “freedom” lent
 To this Black Regiment.
  
 Hundreds on hundreds fell;
 But they are resting well;
 Scourges and shackles strong
 Never shall do them wrong.
  
 Oh, to the living few,
 Soldiers, be just and true!
 Hail them as comrades tried;
 Fight with them side by side;
 Never, in field or tent,
 Scorn the Black Regiment."
643,Charleston,Henry Timrod,"Calm as that second summer which precedes
        The first fall of the snow,
 In the broad sunlight of heroic deeds,
        The City bides the foe.
  
 As yet, behind their ramparts stern and proud,
        Her bolted thunders sleep—
 Dark Sumter, like a battlemented cloud,
        Looms o’er the solemn deep.
  
 No Calpe frowns from lofty cliff or scar
        To guard the holy strand;
 But Moultrie holds in leash her dogs of war
        Above the level sand.
  
 And down the dunes a thousand guns lie couched,
        Unseen, beside the flood—
 Like tigers in some Orient jungle crouched
         That wait and watch for blood.
  
 Meanwhile, through streets still echoing with trade,
        Walk grave and thoughtful men,
 Whose hands may one day wield the patriot’s blade
        As lightly as the pen.
  
 And maidens, with such eyes as would grow dim
        Over a bleeding hound,
 Seem each one to have caught the strength of him
        Whose sword she sadly bound.
  
 Thus girt without and garrisoned at home,
        Day patient following day,
 Old Charleston looks from roof, and spire, and dome,
        Across her tranquil bay.
  
 Ships, through a hundred foes, from Saxon lands
        And spicy Indian ports,
 Bring Saxon steel and iron to her hands,
        And summer to her courts.
  
 But still, along you dim Atlantic line,
        The only hostile smoke
 Creeps like a harmless mist above the brine,
        From some frail, floating oak.
  
 Shall the spring dawn, and she still clad in smiles,
        And with an unscathed brow,
 Rest in the strong arms of her palm-crowned isles,
        As fair and free as now?
  
 We know not; in the temple of the Fates
        God has inscribed her doom;
 And, all untroubled in her faith, she waits
        The triumph or the tomb."
644,The College Colonel,Herman Melville,"He rides at their head;
     A crutch by his saddle just slants in view,
 One slung arm is in splints, you see,
     Yet he guides his strong steed—how coldly too.
  
 He brings his regiment home—
     Not as they filed two years before,
 But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn,
 Like castaway sailors, who—stunned
           By the surf’s loud roar,
     Their mates dragged back and seen no more—
 Again and again breast the surge,
     And at last crawl, spent, to shore.
  
 A still rigidity and pale—
     An Indian aloofness lones his brow;
 He has lived a thousand years
 Compressed in battle’s pains and prayers,
     Marches and watches slow.
 There are welcoming shouts, and flags;
     Old men off hat to the Boy,
 Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,
     But to him—there comes alloy.
  
 It is not that a leg is lost,
     It is not that an arm is maimed,
 It is not that the fever has racked—
     Self he has long disclaimed.
  
 But all through the Seven Days’ Fight,
     And deep in the Wilderness grim,
 And in the field-hospital tent,
     And Petersburg crater, and dim
 Lean brooding in Libby, there came—
     Ah heaven!—what truth to him."
645,Counsel—In the South,Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,"My boy, not of your will nor mine
     You keep the mountain pass and wait,
 Restless, for evil gold to shine
     And hold you to your fate.
  
 A stronger Hand than yours gave you
     The lawless sword—you know not why.
 That you must live is all too true,
     And other men must die.
  
 My boy, be brigand if you must,
     But face the traveller in your track:
 Stand one to one, and never thrust
     The dagger in his back.
  
 Nay, make no ambush of the dark.
     Look straight into your victim’s eyes;
 Then—let his free soul, like a lark,
     Fly, singing, toward the skies.
  
 My boy, if Christ must be betrayed,
     And you must the betrayer be,
 Oh, marked before the worlds were made!
     What help is there for me?
  
 Ah, if the prophets from their graves
     Demand such blood of you as this,
 Take Him, I say, with swords and staves,
     But—never with a kiss!"
646,The Death of Lincoln,William Cullen Bryant,"Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,
 Gentle and merciful and just!
 Who, in the fear of God, didst bear
 The sword of power, a nation’s trust!
  
 In sorrow by thy bier we stand,
 Amid the awe that hushes all,
 And speak the anguish of a land
 That shook with horror at thy fall.
  
 Thy task is done; the bond are free:
 We bear thee to an honored grave,
 Whose proudest monument shall be
 The broken fetters of the slave.
  
 Pure was thy life; its bloody close
 Hath placed thee with the sons of light,
 Among the noble host of those
 Who perished in the cause of Right."
647,Giving Back the Flower,Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,"So, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night,
    And to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair,
Till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight,
    And to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,
  
Say, must you taunt me forever, forever? You looked at my hand and you knew
    That I was the slave of the Ring, while you were as free as the wind is free.
When I saw your corpse in your coffin, I flung back your flower to you;
    It was all of yours that I ever had; you may keep it, and—keep from me.
  
Ah? so God is your witness. Has God, then, no world to look after but ours?
    May He not have been searching for that wild star, with the trailing plumage, that
        flew
Far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers,
    Or else brightening some planet’s luminous rings, instead of thinking of you?
  
Or, if He was near us at all, do you think that He would sit listening there
    Because you sang “Hear me, Norma,” to a woman in jewels and lace,
While, so close to us, down in another street, in the wet, unlighted air,
    There were children crying for bread and fire, and mothers who questioned His
        grace?
  
Or perhaps He had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day,
    To number the bloody stabs that were there, to look at and judge the dead;
Or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay;
    At least I do not believe that He cares to remember a word that you said.
  
So take back your flowers, I tell you—of its sweetness I now have no need;
    Yes; take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep;
When you wake I will take it, and God, then, perhaps will witness indeed,
    But go, now, and tell Death he must watch you, and not let you walk in your sleep."
648,"Hearing the Battle.—July 21, 1861",Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,"One day in the dreamy summer,
     On the Sabbath hills, from afar
 We heard the solemn echoes
     Of the first fierce words of war.
  
 Ah, tell me, thou veilèd Watcher
     Of the storm and the calm to come,
 How long by the sun or shadow
     Till these noises again are dumb.
  
 And soon in a hush and glimmer
     We thought of the dark, strange fight,
 Whose close in a ghastly quiet
     Lay dim in the beautiful night.
  
 Then we talk’d of coldness and pallor,
     And of things with blinded eyes
 That stared at the golden stillness
     Of the moon in those lighted skies;
  
 And of souls, at morning wrestling
     In the dust with passion and moan,
 So far away at evening
     In the silence of worlds unknown.
  
 But a delicate wind beside us
     Was rustling the dusky hours,
 As it gather’d the dewy odors
     Of the snowy jessamine-flowers.
  
 And I gave you a spray of the blossoms,
     And said: “I shall never know
 How the hearts in the land are breaking,
     My dearest, unless you go.”"
649,The House-top,Herman Melville,"A Night Piece        (July, 1863)

No sleep. The sultriness pervades the air
 And binds the brain—a dense oppression, such
 As tawny tigers feel in matted shades,
 Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage.
 Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads
 Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by.
 Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf
 Of muffled sound, the atheist roar of riot.
 Yonder, where parching Sirius set in drought
 Balefully glares red Arson—there—and there.
 The town is taken by its rats—ship-rats
 And rats of the wharves. All civil charms
 And priestly spells which late held hearts in awe—
 Fear-bound, subjected to a better sway
 Than sway of self; these like a dream dissolve,
 And man rebounds whole aeons back in nature.
 Hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead,
 And ponderous drag that shakes the wall.
 Wise Draco comes, deep in the midnight roll
 Of black artillery; he comes, though late;
 In code corroborating Calvin’s creed
 And cynic tyrannies of honest kings;
 He comes, nor parlies; and the Town, redeemed,
 Gives thanks devout; nor, being thankful, heeds
 The grimy slur on the Republic’s faith implied,
 Which holds that Man is naturally good,
 And—more—is Nature’s Roman, never to be scourged."
650,In the Prison Pen,Herman Melville,"(1864)

Listless he eyes the palisades
      And sentries in the glare;
 ’Tis barren as a pelican-beach—
      But his world is ended there.
  
 Nothing to do; and vacant hands
      Bring on the idiot-pain;
 He tries to think—to recollect,
      But the blur is on his brain.
  
 Around him swarm the plaining ghosts
      Like those on Virgil’s shore—
 A wilderness of faces dim,
      And pale ones gashed and hoar.
  
 A smiting sun. No shed, no tree;
      He totters to his lair—
 A den that sick hands dug in earth
      Ere famine wasted there,
  
 Or, dropping in his place, he swoons,
      Walled in by throngs that press,
 Till forth from the throngs they bear him dead—
       Dead in his meagerness."
651,In the Wilderness,George Henry Boker,"Mangled, uncared for, suffering thro’ the night
     With heavenly patience the poor boy had lain;
 Under the dreary shadows, left and right,
     Groaned on the wounded, stiffened out the slain.
       What faith sustained his lone,
       Brave heart to make no moan,
 To send no cry from that blood-sprinkled sod,
 Is a close mystery with him and God.
  
 But when the light came, and the morning dew
     Glittered around him, like a golden lake,
 And every dripping flower with deepened hue
     Looked through its tears for very pity’s sake,
       He moved his aching head
       Upon his rugged bed,
 And smiled as a blue violet, virgin-meek,
 Laid her pure kiss upon his withered cheek.
  
 At once there circled in his waking heart
     A thousand memories of distant home;
 Of how those same blue violets would start
     Along his native fields, and some would roam
       Down his dear humming brooks,
       To hide in secret nooks,
 And, shyly met, in nodding circles swing,
 Like gossips murmuring at belated Spring.
  
 And then he thought of the beloved hands
     That with his own had plucked the modest flower.
 The blue-eyed maiden, crowned with golden bands,
     Who ruled as sovereign of that sunny hour.
       She at whose soft command
       He joined the mustering band,
 She for whose sake he lay so firm and still,
 Despite his pangs, not questioned then her will.
  
 So, lost in thought, scarce conscious of the deed,
     Culling the violets, here and there he crept
 Slowly—ah! slowly,—for his wound would bleed;
     And the sweet flowers themselves half smiled, half wept,
       To be thus gathered in
       By hands so pale and thin,
 By fingers trembling as they neatly laid
 Stem upon stem, and bound them in a braid.
  
 The strangest posy ever fashioned yet
     Was clasped against the bosom of the lad,
 As we, the seekers for the wounded, set
     His form upon our shoulders bowed and sad;
       Though he but seemed to think
       How violets nod and wink;
 And as we cheered him, for the path was wild,
 He only looked upon his flowers and smiled."
652,Like Brothers We Meet,George Moses Horton,"Dedicated to the Federal and Late Confederate Soldiers

Like heart-loving brothers we meet,
    And still the loud thunders of strife,
The blaze of fraternity kindles most sweet,
    There’s nothing more pleasing in life.
  
The black cloud of faction retreats,
    The poor is no longer depressed,
See those once discarded resuming their seats,
    The lost strangers soon will find rest.
  
The soldier no longer shall roam,
    But soon shall land safely ashore,
Each soon will arrive at his own native home,
    And struggle in warfare no more.
  
The union of brothers is sweet,
    Whose wives and children do come,
Their sons and fair daughters with pleasure they greet,
    When long absent fathers come home.
  
They never shall languish again,
    Nor discord their union shall break,
When brothers no longer lament and complain,
    Hence never each other forsake.
  
Hang closely together like friends,
    By peace killing foes never driven,
The storm of commotion eternally ends,
    And earth will soon turn into Heaven."
653,Lincoln,Henrietta Cordelia Ray,"To-day, O martyred chief, beneath the sun
 We would unveil thy form; to thee who won
 Th’applause of nations for thy soul sincere,
 A loving tribute we would offer here.
 ’T was thine not worlds to conquer, but men’s hearts;
 To change to balm the sting of slavery’s darts;
 In lowly charity thy joy to find,
 And open “gates of mercy on mankind.”
 And so they come, the freed, with grateful gift,
 From whose sad path the shadows thou didst lift.
  
 Eleven years have rolled their seasons round,
 Since its most tragic close thy life-work found.
 Yet through the vistas of the vanished days
 We see thee still, responsive to our gaze,
 As ever to thy country’s solemn needs.
 Not regal coronets, but princely deeds
 Were thy chaste diadem; of truer worth
 Thy modest virtues than the gems of earth.
 Stanch, honest, fervent in the purest cause,
 Truth was thy guide; her mandates were thy laws.
  
 Rare heroism, spirit-purity,
 The storied Spartan’s stern simplicity,
 Such moral strength as gleams like burnished gold
 Amid the doubt of men of weaker mould,
 Were thine. Called in thy country’s sorest hour,
 When brother knew not brother—mad for power—
 To guide the helm through bloody deeps of war,
 While distant nations gazed in anxious awe,
 Unflinching in the task, thou didst fulfill
 Thy mighty mission with a deathless will.
  
 Born to a destiny the most sublime,
 Thou wert, O Lincoln! in the march of time,
 God bade thee pause and bid the oppressed go free—
 Most glorious boon giv’n to humanity.
 While slavery ruled the land, what deeds were done?
 What tragedies enacted ’neath the sun!
 Her page is blurred with records of defeat,
 Of lives heroic lived in silence, meet
 For the world’s praise; of woe, despair and tears,
 The speechless agony of weary years.
  
 Thou utteredst the word, and Freedom fair
 Rang her sweet bells on the clear winter air;
 She waved her magic wand, and lo! from far
 A long procession came. With many a scar
 Their brows were wrinkled, in the bitter strife,
 Full many had said their sad farewell to life
 But on they hastened, free, their shackles gone;
 The aged, young,—e’en infancy was borne
 To offer unto thee loud paeans of praise,—
 Their happy tribute after saddest days.
  
 A race set free! The deed brought joy and light!
 It bade calm Justice from her sacred height,
 When faith and hope and courage slowly waned,
 Unfurl the stars and stripes, at last unstained!
 The nations rolled acclaim from sea to sea,
 And Heaven’s vault rang with Freedom’s harmony.
 The angels ’mid the amaranths must have hushed
 Their chanted cadences, as upward rushed
 The hymn sublime: and as the echoes pealed,
 God’s ceaseless benison the action sealed.
  
 As now we dedicate this shaft to thee,
 True champion! in all humility
 And solemn earnestness, we would erect
 A monument invisible, undecked,
 Save by our allied purpose to be true
 To Freedom’s loftiest precepts, so that through
 The fiercest contests we may walk secure,
 Fixed on foundations that may still endure,
 When granite shall have crumbled to decay,
 And generations passed from earth away.
  
 Exalted patriot! illustrious chief!
 Thy life’s immortal work compels belief.
 To-day in radiance thy virtues shine,
 And how can we a fitting garland twine?
 Thy crown most glorious to a ransomed race!
 High on our country’s scroll we fondly trace,
 In lines of fadeless light that softly blend,
 Emancipator, hero, martyr, friend!
 While Freedom may her holy sceptre claim,
 The world shall echo with Our Lincoln’s name."
654,Lincoln Is Dead,George Moses Horton,"He is gone, the strong base of the nation,
     The dove to his covet has fled;
 Ye heroes lament his privation,
     For Lincoln is dead.
  
 He is gone down, the sun of the Union,
     Like Phoebus, that sets in the west;
 The planet of peace and communion,
     Forever has gone to his rest.
  
 He is gone down from a world of commotion,
     No equal succeeds in his stead;
 His wonders extend with the ocean,
     Whose waves murmur, Lincoln is dead.
  
 He is gone and can ne’er be forgotten,
     Whose great deeds eternal shall bloom;
 When gold, pearls and diamonds are rotten,
     His deeds will break forth from the tomb.
  
 He is gone out of glory to glory,
     A smile with the tear may be shed,
 O, then let us tell the sweet story,
     Triumphantly, Lincoln is dead."
655,Malvern Hill,Herman Melville,"(July, 1862)

Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill
      In prime of morn and May,
 Recall ye how McClellan’s men
      Here stood at bay?
 While deep within yon forest dim
      Our rigid comrades lay—
 Some with the cartridge in their mouth,
 Others with fixed arms lifted South—
             Invoking so
 The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe!
  
 The spires of Richmond, late beheld
      Through rifts in musket-haze,
 Were closed from view in clouds of dust
      On leaf-walled ways,
 Where streamed our wagons in caravan;
      And the Seven Nights and Days
 Of march and fast, retreat and fight,
 Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight—
             Does the elm wood
 Recall the haggard beards of blood?
  
 The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed
      We followed (it never fell!)—
 In silence husbanded our strength—
           Received their yell;
 Till on this slope we patient turned
      With cannon ordered well;
 Reverse we proved was not defeat;
 But ah, the sod what thousands meet!—
                Does Malvern Wood
 Bethink itself, and muse and brood?
  
                         We elms of Malvern Hill
                              Remember every thing;
                         But sap the twig will fill;
                         Wag the world how it will,
                              Leaves must be green in Spring."
656,The Martyr,Herman Melville,"Indicative of the passion of the people on the 15th of April, 1865

Good Friday was the day
     Of the prodigy and crime,
 When they killed him in his pity,
     When they killed him in his prime
 Of clemency and calm—
          When with yearning he was filled
          To redeem the evil-willed,
 And, though conqueror, be kind;
     But they killed him in his kindness,
     In their madness and their blindness,
 And they killed him from behind.
  
               There is sobbing of the strong,
                    And a pall upon the land;
               But the People in their weeping
                                     Bare the iron hand:
               Beware the People weeping
                    When they bare the iron hand.
  
 He lieth in his blood—
     The father in his face;
 They have killed him, the Forgiver—
     The Avenger takes his place,
 The Avenger wisely stern,
          Who in righteousness shall do
          What heavens call him to,
 And the parricides remand;
     For they killed him in his kindness,
     In their madness and their blindness.
 And his blood is on their hand.
  
                     There is sobbing of the strong,
                         And a pall upon the land;
                     But the People in their weeping
                                     Bare the iron hand:
                     Beware the People weeping
                         When they bare the iron hand."
657,The Nineteenth of April,Lucy Larcom,"This year, till late in April, the snow fell thick and light:
 Thy truce-flag, friendly Nature, in clinging drifts of white,
 Hung over field and city: now everywhere is seen,
 In place of that white quietness, a sudden glow of green.
  
 The verdure climbs the Common, beneath the leafless trees,
 To where the glorious Stars and Stripes are floating on the breeze.
 There, suddenly as Spring awoke from Winter’s snow-draped gloom,
 The Passion-Flower of Seventy-six is bursting into bloom.
  
 Dear is the time of roses, when earth to joy is wed,
 And garden-plot and meadow wear one generous flush of red;
 But now in dearer beauty, to her ancient colors true,
 Blooms the old town of Boston in red and white and blue.
  
 Along the whole awakening North are those bright emblems spread;
 A summer noon of patriotism is burning overhead:
 No party badges flaunting now, no word of clique or clan;
 But “Up for God and Union!” is the shout of every man.
  
 Oh, peace is dear to Northern hearts; our hard-earned homes more dear;
 But freedom is beyond the price of any earthly cheer;
 And freedom’s flag is sacred; he who would work it harm,
 Let him, although a brother, beware our strong right arm!
  
 A brother! ah, the sorrow, the anguish of that word!
 The fratricidal strife begun, when will its end be heard?
 Not this the boon that patriot hearts have prayed and waited for;—
 We loved them, and we longed for peace: but they would have it war.
  
 Yes; war! on this memorial day, the day of Lexington,
 A lightning-thrill along the wires from heart to heart has run.
 Brave men we gazed on yesterday, to-day for us have bled:
 Again is Massachusetts blood the first for Freedom shed.
  
 To war,—and with our brethren, then,—if only this can be!
 Life hangs as nothing in the scale against dear Liberty!
 Though hearts be torn asunder, for Freedom we will fight:
 Our blood may seal the victory, but God will shield the Right!"
658,The Old Slave-Music,Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt,"Blow back the breath of the bird,
     Scatter the song through the air,
 There was music you never heard,
     And cannot hear anywhere.
  
 It was not the sob of the vain
     In the old, old dark so sweet,
 (I shall never hear it again,)
     Nor the coming of fairy feet.
  
 It was music and music alone,
     Not a sigh from a lover’s mouth;
 Now it comes in a phantom moan
     From the dead and buried South.
  
 It was savage and fierce and glad,
     It played with the heart at will;
 Oh, what a wizard touch it had—
     Oh, if I could hear it still!
  
 Were they slaves? They were not then;
     The music had made them free.
 They were happy women and men—
     What more do we care to be?
  
 There is blood and blackness and dust,
     There are terrible things to see,
 There are stories of swords that rust,
     Between that music and me.
  
 Dark ghosts with your ghostly tunes
     Come back till I laugh through tears;
 Dance under the sunken moons,
     Dance over the grassy years!
  
 Hush, hush—I know it, I say;
     Your armies were bright and brave,
 But the music they took away
     Was worth—whatever they gave."
659,The Picket-Guard,Ethel Lynn Beers,"“All quiet along the Potomac,” they say,
       “Except, now and then, a stray picket
 Is shot as he walks on his beat to and fro,
       By a rifleman hid in the thicket.
 ’Tis nothing—a private or two, now and then,
       Will not count in the news of the battle;
 Not an officer lost—only one of the men
       Moaning out, all alone, his death-rattle.”
  
                         *    *    *    *    *    *
  
 All quiet along the Potomac to-night,
       Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;
 Their tents, in the rays of the clear autumn moon
       Or the light of the watch-fire, are gleaming.
 A tremulous sigh, as the gentle night-wind
       Through the forest-leaves softly is creeping;
 While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,
       Keep guard—for the army is sleeping.
  
 There’s only the sound of the lone sentry’s tread,
       As he tramps from the rock to the fountain,
 And thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed
       Far away in the cot on the mountain.
 His musket falls slack—his face, dark and grim,
       Grows gentle with memories tender,
 As he mutters a prayer for the children asleep—
       For their mother—may Heaven defend her!
  
 The moon seems to shine just as brightly as then,
       That night, when the love yet unspoken
 Leaped up to his lips—when low-murmured vows
       Were pledged to be ever unbroken.
 Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,
       He dashes off tears that are welling,
 And gathers his gun closer up to its place,
       As if to keep down the heart-swelling.
  
 He passes the fountain, the blasted pine-tree,
       The footstep is lagging and weary;
 Yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light,
       Toward the shade of the forest so dreary.
 Hark! was it the night-wind that rustled the leaves?
       Was it moonlight so suddenly flashing?
 It looked life a rifle—“Ha! Mary, good-by!”
       And the life-blood is ebbing and plashing.
  
 All quiet along the Potomac to-night,
       No sound save the rush of the river;
 While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead—
       The picket’s off duty forever!"
660,Sheridan at Cedar Creek,Herman Melville,"(October, 1864)

Shoe the steed with silver
      That bore him to the fray,
 When he heard the guns at dawning—
                Miles away;
 When he heard them calling, calling—
           Mount! nor stay:
                Quick, or all is lost;
                They’ve surprised and stormed the post,
                They push your routed host—
      Gallop! retrieve the day!
  
 House the horse in ermine—
      For the foam-flake blew
 White through the red October;
      He thundered into view;
 They cheered him in the looming;
      Horseman and horse they knew.
                The turn of the tide began,
                The rally of bugles ran,
                He swung his hat in the van;
      The electric hoof-spark flew.
  
 Wreathe the steed and lead him—
      For the charge he led
 Touched and turned the cypress
      Into amaranths for the head
 Of Philip, king of riders,
      Who raised them from the dead.
                The camp (at dawning lost)
                By eve recovered—forced,
                Rang with laughter of the host
       At belated Early fled.
  
 Shroud the horse in sable—
      For the mounds they heap!
 There is firing in the Valley,
      And yet no strife they keep;
 It is the parting volley,
      It is the pathos deep.
                There is glory for the brave
                Who lead, and nobly save,
                But no knowledge in the grave
      Where the nameless followers sleep."
661,[Sonnet],George Henry Boker,"Brave comrade, answer! When you joined the war,
     What left you? “Wife and children, wealth and friends,
     A storied home whose ancient roof-tree bends
     Above such thoughts as love tells o’er and o’er.”
 Had you no pang or struggle? “Yes; I bore
     Such pain on parting as at hell’s gate rends
     The entering soul, when from its grasp ascends
     The last faint virtue which on earth it wore.”
 You loved your home, your kindred, children, wife;
     You loathed yet plunged into war’s bloody whirl!—
     What urged you? “Duty! Something more than life.
 That which made Abraham bare the priestly knife,
     And Isaac kneel, or that young Hebrew girl
     Who sought her father coming from the strife.”"
662,The Southern Refugee,George Moses Horton,"What sudden ill the world await,
     From my dear residence I roam;
 I must deplore the bitter fate,
     To straggle from my native home.
  
 The verdant willow droops her head,
     And seems to bid a fare thee well;
 The flowers with tears their fragrance shed,
     Alas! their parting tale to tell.
  
’Tis like the loss of Paradise,
     Or Eden’s garden left in gloom,
 Where grief affords us no device;
     Such is thy lot, my native home.
  
 I never, never shall forget
     My sad departure far away,
 Until the sun of life is set,
     And leaves behind no beam of day.
  
 How can I from my seat remove
     And leave my ever devoted home,
 And the dear garden which I love,
     The beauty of my native home?
  
 Alas! sequestered, set aside,
     It is a mournful tale to tell;
 ’Tis like a lone deserted bride
     That bade her bridegroom fare thee well.
  
 I trust I soon shall dry the tear
     And leave forever hence to roam,
 Far from a residence so dear,
     The place of beauty—my native home."
663,A Thought,Elizabeth Drew Barstow Stoddard,"Falling leaves and falling men!
     When the snows of winter fall,
 And the winds of winter blows,
     Will be woven Nature’s pall.
  
 Let us, then, forsake our dead;
     For the dead will surely wait
 While we rush upon the foe,
     Eager for the hero’s fate.
  
 Leaves will come upon the trees;
     Spring will show the happy race;
 Mothers will give birth to sons—
     Loyal souls to fill our place.
  
 Wherefore should we rest and rush?
     Soldiers, we must fight and save
 Freedom now, and give our foes
     All their country should—a grave!"
664,The Two Armies,Henry Timrod,"Two armies stand enrolled beneath
 The banner with the starry wreath;
 One, facing battle, blight and blast,
 Through twice a hundred fields has passed;
 Its deeds against a ruffian foe,
 Steam, valley, hill, and mountain know,
 Till every wind that sweeps the land
 Goes, glory laden, from the strand.
  
 The other, with a narrower scope,
 Yet led by not less grand a hope,
 Hath won, perhaps, as proud a place,
 And wears its fame with meeker grace.
 Wives march beneath its glittering sign,
 Fond mothers swell the lovely line,
 And many a sweetheart hides her blush
 In the young patriot’s generous flush.
  
 No breeze of battle ever fanned
 The colors of that tender band;
 Its office is beside the bed,
 Where throbs some sick or wounded head.
 It does not court the soldier’s tomb,
 But plies the needle and the loom;
 And, by a thousand peaceful deeds,
 Supplies a struggling nation’s needs.
  
 Nor is that army’s gentle might
 Unfelt amid the deadly fight;
 It nerves the son’s, the husband's hand,
 It points the lover’s fearless brand;
 It thrills the languid, warms the cold,
 Gives even new courage to the bold;
 And sometimes lifts the veriest clod
 To its own lofty trust in God.
  
 When Heaven shall blow the trump of peace,
 And bid this weary warfare cease,
 Their several missions nobly done,
 The triumph grasped, and freedom won,
 Both armies, from their toils at rest,
 Alike may claim the victor’s crest,
 But each shall see its dearest prize
 Gleam softly from the other’s eyes."
665,Weaving,Lucy Larcom,"All day she stands before her loom;
     The flying shuttles come and go:
 By grassy fields, and trees in bloom,
     She sees the winding river flow:
 And fancy’s shuttle flieth wide,
 And faster than the waters glide.
  
 Is she entangled in her dreams,
     Like that fair-weaver of Shalott,
 Who left her mystic mirror’s gleams,
     To gaze on light Sir Lancelot?
 Her heart, a mirror sadly true,
 Brings gloomier visions into view.
  
 “I weave, and weave, the livelong day:
     The woof is strong, the warp is good:
 I weave, to be my mother’s stay;
     I weave, to win my daily food:
 But ever as I weave,” saith she,
 “The world of women haunteth me.
  
 “The river glides along, one thread
     In nature’s mesh, so beautiful!
 The stars are woven in; the red
     Of sunrise; and the rain-cloud dull.
 Each seems a separate wonder wrought;
 Each blends with some more wondrous thought.
  
 “So, at the loom of life, we weave
     Our separate shreds, that varying fall,
 Some strained, some fair: and, passing, leave
     To God the gathering up of all,
 In that full pattern wherein man
 Works blindly out the eternal plan.
  
 “In his vast work, for good or ill,
     The undone and the done he blends:
 With whatsoever woof we fill,
     To our weak hands His might He lends,
 And gives the threads beneath His eye
 The texture of eternity.
  
 “Wind on, by willow and by pine,
     Thou blue, untroubled Merrimack!
 Afar, by sunnier streams than thine,
     My sisters toil, with foreheads black;
 And water with their blood this root,
 Whereof we gather bounteous fruit.
  
 “There be sad women, sick and poor:
     And those who walk in garments soiled:
 Their shame, their sorrow, I endure;
     By their defect my hope is foiled:
 The blot they bear is on my name;
 Who sins, and I am not to blame?
  
 “And how much of your wrong is mine,
     Dark women slaving at the South?
 Of your stolen grapes I quaff the wine;
     The bread you starve for fills my mouth:
 The beam unwinds, but every thread
 With blood of strangled souls is red.
  
 “If this be so, we win and wear
     A Nessus-robe of poisoned cloth;
 Or weave them shrouds they may not wear,—
     Fathers and brothers falling both
 On ghastly, death-sown fields, that lie
 Beneath the tearless Southern sky.
  
 “Alas! the weft has lost its white.
     It grows a hideous tapestry,
 That pictures war’s abhorrent sight:—
     Unroll not, web of destiny!
 Be the dark volume left unread,—
 The tale untold,—the curse unsaid!”
  
 So up and down before her loom
     She paces on, and to and fro,
 Till sunset fills the dusty room,
     And makes the water redly glow,
 As if the Merrimack’s calm flood
 Were changed into a stream of blood.
  
 Too soon fulfilled, and all too true
     The words she murmured as she wrought:
 But, weary weaver, not to you
     Alone was war’s stern message brought:
 “Woman!” it knelled from heart to heart,
 “Thy sister’s keeper know thou art!”"
666,Einstein’s Happiest Moment,Richard M. Berlin,"Einstein’s happiest moment
occurred when he realized
a falling man falling
beside a falling apple
could also be described
as an apple and a man at rest
while the world falls around them.

And my happiest moment
occurred when I realized
you were falling for me,
right down to the core, and the rest,
relatively speaking, has flown past
faster than the speed of light."
667,A Little Shiver,Barton Sutter,"After the news, the forecaster crowed
With excitement about his bad tidings:
Eighteen inches of snow! Take cover!
A little shiver ran through the community.
Children abandoned their homework.
Who cared about the hypotenuse now?
The snowplow driver laid out his long johns.
The old couple, who’d barked at each other
At supper, smiled shyly, turned off the TV,
And climbed the stairs to their queen-size bed
Heaped high with blankets and quilts.
And the aging husky they failed to hear
Scratch the back door, turned around twice
In the yard, settled herself in the snow,
And covered her nose with her tail."
668,Sledding in Wichita,Casey Pycior,"As cars pass, laboring through the slush,
a boy, bundled against the stiff wind
in his snow suit, gloves, and scarf,
leans on his upright toboggan,
waiting his turn atop
the snow-packed overpass—
the highest point in town.
First one car exits, and then another,
each creeping down the icy ramp.
The brown grass pokes through
the two grooves carved in the short hill.
As the second car fishtails to a stop at the bottom,
brake lights glowing on the dirty snow,
the boy’s turn comes.
His trip to the bottom is swift—
only a second or two—
and he bails out just before the curb.
It’s not much, but it’s sledding in Wichita."
670,Sponge Bath,Terri Kirby Erickson,"Draped in towels,
my grandmother sits in a hard-backed
chair, a white bowl

of soapy water on the floor.
She lifts her frail arm, then rests it,

gratefully, in her daughter’s palm.
Gliding a wet

washcloth, my mother’s hand
becomes a cloud, and every bruise, a rain-
drenched flower."
671,A Treatise on Painting,Anna Rabinowitz,". . . some days ago I saw the picture of an Angel who, in making the Annunciation, seemed to be trying to chase Mary out of her room with movements showing the sort of attack one might make on some hated enemy; and Mary, as if desperate, seemed to be trying to throw herself out of the window. Do not fall into errors like these.  

                                                                                                — Leonardo da Vinci

It is time to speak of the lies
            of images, omissions, insertions—
  
             imitations of reality,
  
                         but whose reality, Leonardo?
  
     For you she’s in nature—
  
                 you’ve lavished so much attention
                                      on rock formations along your raised horizon
                 varieties of grass in the lawn
                 cloud convocations
  
                          and the shadow the archangel casts
            obliterating most of what’s imagined growing there
  
                        and she, lovely, composed—“great grace of shadows and of lights is added
to the faces of those who sit” beside the darkness of brown plasterwork—her right arm
almost deformed, too far forward,
  
                        reaching out at an impossible angle—
 
                                                FOR WHAT
 
 —Botticelli, Campin, van Eyck—for you
 
she’s indoors all decked out in luscious silk and satin,
surrounded by finery—tied-back drapery, carved benches,
a rug or tiled floor, loggias
and archways beyond her wildest ken
windows revealing hortus conclusi and winding paths
              slogging toward the sea

And what of all those blues and golds, so rife with wealth
 
            in her life there’s only red from madder juice
            and yellow from kaolin clay
                        and a linen shift all frayed
 
The truth also is a small opening high up on the wall
A floor that’s hard-packed dirt
And beyond the room, villagers working the fields,
donkeys dragging threshing boards over newly harvested wheat
 
            AND EVERYWHERE, INSIDE AND OUT, WORLD-MOTHETING DUST
 
                                         For all of you
this is an event reduced to a book she cannot read
a lily she does not smell
a lectern she never owned
 
She might as well comb her hair with a stiletto heel
Make of her body a cloud of white tulle
Carry a watering can and wear shapely wooden clogs
Fake glamour in a black bare-back gown
Crouch on the ground flipping coins
Pop a pogo stick between her legs and levitate
 
                          SHE COULD BE ANYONE            ANYWHERE             ANYTIME
 
 
She could be sitting in her slip, bored,
bored to death, the intercom

                                    (rough-hewn flax is what she’d have)
 
Or she could be blending a batch of myrrh

not on a vista of budding poplars

            and bleating sheep wait to be herded up the hill

For posterity the memory of being

672,Up Against It,Eamon Grennan,"It’s the way they cannot understand the window
they buzz and buzz against, the bees that take
a wrong turn at my door and end up thus
in a drift at first of almost idle curiosity,
cruising the room until they find themselves
smack up against it and they cannot fathom how
the air has hardened and the world they know
with their eyes keeps out of reach as, stuck there
with all they want just in front of them, they must
fling their bodies against the one unalterable law
of things—this fact of glass—and can only go on
making the sound that tethers their electric
fury to what’s impossible, feeling the sting in it."

licking the trunk below, a country-sized
            puddle calls forth the child whose name, the mother
vowed, would not be drowned, no matter how
            high she had to climb. my mother’s water
 
washed her bare yellow bathroom tile many
            years ago, a diluvial warning
of my struggle to arrive. we fought to
            get me out, and have been tugging at each
 
other ever since, tethered by a cord
            that simply thickens when it’s cut. we
descended then, thirsting, churning, not into
            the waters that hound the mozambican
 
mother, baying her and her baby in
            the tree, but into that enduring ocean
in which—as mother, daughter, or both—a

679,The Second Inaugural,Barbara Claire Freeman,"Dear Necessity, the magnitude
            and difficulty of the trust to which the voice
                        of my country has called arises from the recent
tempest, adopted by the Spanish to name
            the storms they encountered in New Times
                        Roman. These reflections, bracketed
by floods, have forced themselves
            so strongly on my mind that I fear
                        Hurakan, who commands winds
from the east. In the night there is a coming
            and going of people, but where are the former
                        ties? Although the wounds of many
of you have begun to fester,
            there are none under the waters, there are
                        none. In this conflict all I dare aver
is that it has been my faithful study
            to collect a duty from a just appreciation
                        of every street lamp in Philadelphia. If I
have violated willingly or silently
            the injunction thereof, I may
                        (besides incurring constitutional punishment) be subject
            to the upbraiding of all who are now
                        witnesses of this present solemnity. I did
not say, “In this chapter begins your future, it cannot be put out by fire.”"

before the full moon
 
            the moon seems
full. what is missing
is a dark hungry
            sickle, the sliver
of shadow eating
 
            us up inside. after
the mountains breathe
their mint-and-sorrow
            green against the long
summer sky, they burst
 
            into hot october
laughter, lighting
the horizon with citrus,
            rust, and blood. you
put this knife in my
           
            hand. we pull. we
meet as oceans come
together, heaving
            against and clinging
across our salt watery
 
            boundary. we approach
endlessly like two rails
of one track, tied
            in a parallel that
promises our eyes to
 
            merge, someplace far
off in the distance. you
put this feather in my
            palm. my fingers
close around flight."
681,Christmas Mail,Ted Kooser,"Cards in each mailbox,
angel, manger, star and lamb,
as the rural carrier,
driving the snowy roads,
hears from her bundles
the plaintive bleating of sheep,
the shuffle of sandals,
the clopping of camels.
At stop after stop,
she opens the little tin door
and places deep in the shadows
the shepherds and wise men,
the donkeys lank and weary,
the cow who chews and muses.
And from her Styrofoam cup,
white as a star and perched
on the dashboard, leading her
ever into the distance,
there is a hint of hazelnut,
and then a touch of myrrh."
682,Family Vacation,Judith Slater,"Four weeks in, quarreling and far
from home, we came to the loneliest place.
A western railroad town. Remember?
I left you at the campsite with greasy pans
and told our children not to follow me.
The dying light had made me desperate.
I broke into a hobbled run, across tracks,
past warehouses with sun-blanked windows
to where a playground shone in a wooded clearing.
Then I was swinging, out over treetops.
I saw myself never going back, yet
whatever breathed in the mute woods
was not another life. The sun sank.
I let the swing die, my toes scuffed earth,
and I was rocked into remembrance
of the girl who had dreamed the life I had.
Through night, dark at the root, I returned to it."
683,"Koi Pond, Oakland Museum",Susan Kolodny,"Our shadows bring them from the shadows:
a yolk-yellow one with a navy pattern
like a Japanese woodblock print of fish scales.
A fat 18-karat one splashed with gaudy purple
and a patch of gray. One with a gold head,
a body skim-milk-white, trailing ventral fins
like half-folded fans of lace.
A poppy-red, faintly disheveled one,
and one, compact, all indigo in faint green water.
They wear comical whiskers and gather beneath us
as we lean on the cement railing
in indecisive late-December light,
and because we do not feed them, they pass,
then they loop and circle back. Loop and circle. Loop.
“Look,” you say, “beneath them.” Beneath them,
like a subplot or a motive, is a school
of uniformly dark ones, smaller, unadorned,
perhaps another species, living in the shadow
of the gold, purple, yellow, indigo, and white,
seeking the mired roots and dusky grasses,
unliveried, the quieter beneath the quiet."
684,Nest,Jeffrey Harrison,"It wasn’t until we got the Christmas tree
into the house and up on the stand
that our daughter discovered a small bird’s nest
tucked among its needled branches.

Amazing, that the nest had made it
all the way from Nova Scotia on a truck
mashed together with hundreds of other trees
without being dislodged or crushed.
 
And now it made the tree feel wilder,
a balsam fir growing in our living room,
as though at any moment a bird might flutter
through the house and return to the nest.

And yet, because we’d brought the tree indoors,
we’d turned the nest into the first ornament.
So we wound the tree with strings of lights,
draped it with strands of red beads,

and added the other ornaments, then dropped
two small brass bells into the nest, like eggs
containing music, and hung a painted goldfinch
from the branch above, as if to keep them warm."
685,Thanksgiving,Tim Nolan,"Thanks for the Italian chestnuts—with their
tough shells—the smooth chocolaty
skin of them—thanks for the boiling water—

itself a miracle and a mystery—
thanks for the seasoned sauce pan
and the old wooden spoon—and all

the neglected instruments in the drawer—
the garlic crusher—the bent paring knife—
the apple slicer that creates six

perfect wedges out of the crisp Haralson—
thanks for the humming radio—thanks
for the program on the radio

about the guy who was a cross-dresser—
but his wife forgave him—and he
ended up almost dying from leukemia—

(and you could tell his wife loved him
entirely—it was in her deliberate voice)—
thanks for the brined turkey—

the size of a big baby—thanks—
for the departed head of the turkey—
the present neck—the giblets

(whatever they are)—wrapped up as
small gifts inside the cavern of the ribs—
 thanks—thanks—thanks—for the candles

lit on the table—the dried twigs—
the autumn leaves in the blue Chinese vase—
 thanks—for the faces—our faces—in this low light."
686,Theater of Shadows,Derek N. Otsuji,"Nights we could not sleep—
       summer insects singing in dry heat,
              short-circuiting the nerves—

Grandma would light a lamp,
        at the center of our narrow room,
               whose clean conspiracy of light

whispered to the tall blank walls,
       illuminating them suddenly
              like the canvas of a dream.

Between the lamp and wall
       her arthritic wrists grew pliant
              as she molded and cast

improbable animal shapes moving
       on the wordless screen:
              A blackbird, like a mynah, not a crow.

A dark horse’s head that could but would not talk.
       An ashen rabbit (her elusive self)
           triggered in snow

that a quivering touch (like death’s)
       sent scampering into the wings
              of that little theater of shadows
    
that eased us into dreams."
687,Weep,George Moses Horton,"Weep for the country in its present state,
And of the gloom which still the future waits;
The proud confederate eagle heard the sound,
And with her flight fell prostrate to the ground!

Weep for the loss the country has sustained,
By which her now dependent is in jail;
The grief of him who now the war survived,
The conscript husbands and the weeping wives!

Weep for the seas of blood the battle cost,
And souls that ever hope forever lost!
The ravage of the field with no recruit,
Trees by the vengeance blasted to the root!

Weep for the downfall o'er your heads and chief,
Who sunk without a medium of relief;
Who fell beneath the hatchet of their pride,
Then like the serpent bit themselves and died!

Weep for the downfall of your president,
Who far too late his folly must repent;
Who like the dragon did all heaven assail,
And dragged his friends to limbo with his tail!

Weep o'er peculiar swelling coffers void,
Our treasures left, and all their banks destroyed;
Their foundless notes replete with shame to all,
Expecting every day their final fall,
In quest of profit never to be won,
Then sadly fallen and forever down!"
688,Three Hundred Thousand More,James Sloan Gibbons,"We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more, 
 From Mississippi's winding stream, and from New England's shore; 
 We leave our ploughs and workshops, our wives and children dear, 
 With hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear; 
 We dare not look behind us, but steadfastly before: 
 We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!
  
 If you look across the hill tops that meet the Northern sky, 
 Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry; 
 And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloudy vail aside, 
 And floats aloft our spangled flag, in glory and in pride, 
 And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour: 
 We are coming Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!
  
 If you look all up your valleys, where the growing harvests shine, 
 You may see our sturdy farmer boys, fast forming into line; 
 And children from their mothers' knees, are pulling at the weeds, 
 And learning how to reap and sow against their country's needs; 
 And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door: 
 We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!
  
 You have called us, and we're coming, by Richmond's bloody tide 
 To lay us down, for freedom's sake, our brother's bones beside; 
 Or from foul treason's savage group to wrench the murderous blade, 
 And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade; 
 Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before: 
 We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!"
689,To fight aloud is very brave - (138),Emily Dickinson,"To fight aloud, is very brave - 
But gallanter, I know
Who charge within the bosom
The Calvalry of Wo - 

Who win, and nations do not see - 
Who fall - and none observe - 
Whose dying eyes, no Country
Regards with patriot love - 

We trust, in plumed procession
For such, the Angels go -
Rank after Rank, with even feet -
And Uniforms of snow."
690,As Is,Nicholas Friedman,"Just north of town, a quaint Sargasso Sea 
for bric-a-brac: the barn, itself antique,
spills over with a grab-bag panoply
of outworn stock revalued as “unique.”
Typewriters tall as headstones fill the loft
where they’ve been ricked away like sacks of grain;
a coffer yawns the must of oak—gone soft—
when one man, squinting, lifts the lid to feign
intrigue. Nearby, his wife surveys the smalls:
art deco bangles bright as harpsichords,
a glut of iron trivets, Christmas balls,
Depression glass and warping Ouija boards.
One man’s junk is another’s all the same.
They don’t buy much, but that’s not why they came."
691,"At the End of Life, a Secret",Reginald Dwayne Betts,"Everything measured. A man twists 
a tuft of your hair out for no reason 
other than you are naked before him 
and he is bored with nakedness. Moments 
before he was weighing your gallbladder, 
and then he was staring at the empty space 
where your lungs were. Even dead, we still 
say you are an organ donor, as if something 
other than taxes outlasts death. Your feet 
are regular feet. Two of them, and there is no 
mark to suggest you were an expert mathematician, 
nothing that suggests that a woman loved
you until you died. From the time your body 
was carted before him to the time your 
dead body is being sent to the coffin, 
every pound is accounted for, except 21 grams. 
The man is a praying man and has figured 
what it means. He says this is the soul, finally, 
after the breath has gone. The soul: less than 
$4,000 worth of crack—21 grams— 
all that moves you through this world."
692,Blue Line Incident,Jacob Saenz,"He was just some coked-out,
crazed King w/crooked teeth
 & a teardrop forever falling,
fading from his left eye, peddling
crack to passengers or crackheads
passing as passengers on a train
chugging from Chicago to Cicero,
from the Loop through K-Town:
Kedzie, Kostner, Kildare.
    
I was just a brown boy in a brown shirt,
head shaven w/fuzz on my chin,
staring at treetops & rooftops
seated in a pair of beige shorts:
a badge of possibility—a Bunny
let loose from 26th street,
hopping my way home, hoping
not to get shot, stop after stop.

But a ’banger I wasn’t & he wasn’t
buying it, sat across the aisle from me:
Do you smoke crack?
Hey, who you ride wit’?
Are you a D’?
Let me see—throw it down then.

I hesitate then fork three fingers down
then boast about my block,
a recent branch in the Kings growing tree;
the boys of 15th and 51st, I say,
they’re my boys, my friends.
I was fishing for a life-
saver & he took, hooked him in
& had him say goodbye like we was boys
 & shit when really I should’ve
gutted that fuck w/the tip
of my blue ballpoint."
693,Borodin,Donald Revell,"When the world was loveliness I was
A composer, Borodin, my left eye
Level with the floor beside toy men.
Wild work and havoc they made,
Being glad. I could draw a line
Would run straight through the minds of men,
Being a sociable angel,
Music before and after, blushing.

Heaven is a nonsense entirely sensible.
I was a child on the floor beside you,
Making music, becoming small in the rosy
Embrace of God’s best messenger.
I loved your havoc and your hair."
694,Cough,David Yezzi,"I see you once I’ve got you down to size:
a two-day-stubble squatter; jailbait eyes;

the bottle-headed trophy mom; the mentor
always angling his face down from the center

of his universe to shine a light on yours.
The fated anorexic, whose allures

shimmer in the mirror for her eyes
only, denying what her denial denies.

Once you become a cliche I can hate you—
or, treat me tenderly and let me date you.

But that only retards the writing-off
that comes with boredom, amour propre, or (cough) 

irreconcilable differences, i.e.,
those things about you that are least like me,

yet just slightly different, my foible’s homophone,
so in hating yours I really hate my own.

This keeps the focus where it wants to be—
On whom, you ask? Invariably on.... See?

I didn’t even have to say, did I?
I love you so much. No need to reply."
695,For the City that Nearly Broke Me,Reginald Dwayne Betts,"Knots like two dozen fists
swayed with want from the boy’s
kaffiyeh, that black and white scarf
with its useless hands clopping
against the wind in protest
against this boy and his somebody
lost, against their own swaying
in a dance the lost body has lost.
A boy. A somebody lost. A body bodied
in the lights of inauguration night
when every light in the city flared 
with hope. Always losing, always
a boy left with a dozen weights,
small circles on strings pulling
his head down to the ground.
Downcast. Drop your bucket here
and make the city yours and all
that jive keeps him from running.
Escaping the pavement, where
bodies finally fall to rest.
The kaffiyeh keeps him from
bucking against the wind,
hurtling himself to the Grey-
hound or Amtrak or I-95
with a book bag and hitched finger.
His head shrouded in the black
and white, the knots keeping
his eyes down as he traverses
neighborhoods with names like 3rd
World, with names like a nation
falling. And the coffin-voiced
boy is who god tells us he will
save, and so those swinging knots
must be a kind of redemption,
a way to see the bullets that bury
you, constantly, as if death is
the disguise hiding your wings."
696,Foreign Song,Katie Ford,"To bomb them, 
we mustn’t have heard their music 
or known their waterless night watch,
we mustn’t have seen how already 
the desert was under constant death bells
ringing over sleeping cribs and dry wells.
We couldn’t have wanted 
this eavesdropping 
of names we’ve never pronounced 
praying themselves towards death.
I try to believe in us—
we must not 
have heard 
their music."
697,Fresco,Richie Hofmann,"I have come again to the perfumed city.
Houses with tiered porches, some decorated with shells.
You know from the windows that the houses
are from a different time. I am not
to blame for what changes, though sometimes 
I have trouble sleeping.
Between the carriage houses,
there are little gardens separated by gates.
Lately, I have been thinking about the gates.
The one ornamented with the brass lion, I remember
it was warm to the touch
even in what passes here for winter.
But last night, when I closed my eyes,
it was not the lion that I pictured first."
698,The Girls of Winter,Jim Harrison,"Out the window of the bar I’m watching
a circle of girls stretching and yawning
across the street. It’s late January and 74
degrees. They love the heat because
they are a moist heat. Heat loves
heat and today is a tease for what comes
with spring around here when the glorious birds
funnel back up from Mexico. The girls
don’t care about birds because they are birds.
I recall in high school a half dozen
cheerleaders resting on a wrestling mat
in short shorts in the gym, me beside them
with a silly groin ache. What were they?
Living, lovely, warm meat as we all are
reaching out of our bodies for someone else."
699,"GTA: San Andreas (or, “Grove Street, bitch!”)",Jacob Saenz,"I play on Grove Street,
live on Grove Avenue.

Find me in the streets dressed
in greens like groves.

On the avenue, I’m a blue
jeans type of guy.

In the streets, never leave
home w/out my 9mm.

On the avenue, always carry
my pen & wine key, in case

some fool blows his cork.
My UZI sings songs in

the streets—rat-a-tat-tat.
Birds chirp-chirp-chirp

in trees on the avenue.
Rolling down the street

w/my lady—what she wanna do?
“Let’s do a drive-by.”

Rushing down the avenue
w/my baby: “I’m hungry.

Let’s do drive-thru.”
I’ll punch punks purple & blue

in the streets, bleed ’em w/bullets.
On the avenue, I’ll leave punching

to punks dressed in blues, reds,
et cetera & mind my own."
700,The Hurt Sonnet,Casey Thayer,"Dark days when I awaken so I slump
                             back to the swamp of his armpit, a whit

from the arachnid he inked to the stump
                that’s left. So close to the vestige of it,

                                            the danger he’s a reliquary of:
               tattooed noose to venerate the fist

                            of a slug buried still in his butt above
a white cross for the men he didn’t miss.

               If only I could strip off the black map
I sleep against and be his liniment,

                            gloss over the explosion, the mishap
                                           phantom he feels in a forearm itch.

               He won’t leave the long tale his tattoos read
                           for me, so I amend the story."
701,I Remember Lotería,Jacob Saenz,"I remember nights of playing
Lotería w/Mom & Big Manny
as a way to learn the Spanish they spoke
to each other but not to their kids 
who caught on to certain words 
like cállate, cerveza, chicharrón; 
little nuggets I ate up 
like the pinto beans we used
instead of the blue chips
Mom kept in her Bingo bag
she carried every Friday night
when her & Tia Shirley
went to the Moose Lodge,
her hair & coat reeking
w/the smoke of all who lost.
     
I remember El Borracho,
the man always holding a bottle
& about to fall over yet never does
like Big Manny stumbling home
late at night after a payday,
breath & belly full of beer,
who one time took a piss
in our bedroom.

I remember La Garza,
not for the heron it is
but cousin Tony & his kids,
nights of sleepovers & pizza,
PlayStation on a 40-inch TV,
the night he & Lil Jesse sneaked 
bumps of coke in the bathroom
& I rubbed numb my teenage teeth.

I remember El Musico,
not the chubby man clutching his guitarra
but my brother Dave loading crates
of records & a dual turntable case
like a coffin into the back of a van,
the same set I hit my back on at ten
when I fell out of the top bunk bed.

But I prefer to remember La Sirena
back when her breasts were free
of the seashells she now holds
to cover them in water so blue 
 cold, her scales so red,
her name clung to the tongue
like dulce de leche."
702,Imperial City,Richie Hofmann,"From the outset I hated the city of my ancestors.
I was fearful I’d be put in the dungeon below
the cathedral. The best example of the Romanesque
a guide was saying in German      in English      in French
where are buried eight German kings      four queens
twenty-three bishops      four Holy Roman Emperors
all of whom used this bishopric on the river as the seat
of the kingdom. On the old gate at one end a clock
told an ancient form of time. I sulked along behind
my parents as the guide gave facts about the war
with the Saracens      about the place where the Jews bathed
about the child like me whose father the Peaceful
having already produced an heir by his first marriage
could marry      for love."
703,Keys to the City,Richie Hofmann,"Didn’t rain choke the animal throats
of the cathedral      sputter
against the roofs of the city      didn’t the flight
of stairs rise up above the cobbled street
didn’t the key clamor
in the lock      flood
the vestibule with clattering    didn’t we climb
the second flight
toward the miniature Allegory
painted on the ceiling
and touch the flat-faced girls
winged      part animal
who did not flinch and did not scamper"
704,La Prima Victoria,Idra Novey,"She expects nothing but to witness our lives 
and find kindness and why shouldn’t she 
but for the boiling water my partner spills 
on my arm and the FUCK'S SAKE 
that escapes my mouth now the snout 
of the spitting mammal in me. 
If there’s a craft to the failing of simple 
expectations, I have mastered it 
and majestically—but when there’s something 
that must be said, it must be said, 
Lispector says of a woman entering 
an empty room and finding a version 
of herself so dark it makes her pause 
and really see it, how she’s no better 
than the cockroach in her closet 
and so she eats it."
705,The Magic Trick,Nicholas Friedman,"Half clown, half Keebler elf, he works a throng
of meth heads and young mothers who peruse
the storefronts, tugging surly kids along.
The pant legs bunch around his wing-tipped shoes.

When a couple walks up to his TV tray,
he hands them each a tattered business card.
Who wants to see a magic trick today?
He grins and cuts a deck: His hands are scarred,

but seldom shake. The two confer, agree,
and fidget as the magician fans an arc
of cherubs laced with flips of filigree.
The man inspects them for a crease or mark,

but they look clean. I’ve watched him do this trick
for weeks now, each time to polite surprise:
He hams it up; he lays the charm on thick.
(As always, haughty jacks materialize.)

The woman smiles and nods in mild content.
Another trick: He pulls a wrinkled bill
from his lapel and folds the president,
explaining how a wise investment will

turn one buck into ten—et cetera. 
He taps twice on the bill, a modest “one,”
unfolds it square by square, and then voila!—
the bust of Alexander Hamilton.

They clap as the magician takes a bow.
He’s greasy, but he’s on the up-and-up,
and magic tricks are good enough for now.
The woman floats a dollar to his cup."
706,Mockingbird,Hailey Leithauser,"No other song
                    or swoop (part
       quiver, part swivel and
             plash) with
  tour de force
stray the course note
       liquefactions
   (its new,
bawdy air an
       aria hangs in) en-
thralls,
             trills, loops, soars,
                    startles, out-warbles,
out-brawns, more
       juicily,
                    lifts up
the dawn, outlaws from
                        sackcloth, the cool
     sloth of bed sheets,
                             from pillows
           and silks
                and blue-quilted, feminine
bolsters, fusses
                      of coverlets;
                                   nips as the switch
of a juvenile willow, fuzz
               of a nettle, to
       window and window
                           and window and ever
                   toward egress, to
           flurry, pollen
and petal shed,
                            to wet street
  and wet pavement,
              all sentiment intemperate,
  all sentience
                         ephemeral."
707,"Not the Song, but After",Nicholas Friedman,"Now everywhere the pageantry of youth
      is on display:
The squeal of bike chains spinning through the gray
     plays fugue to puddle-froth;

The punctual blitz of hyacinths in April
     ushers spring
with lavender dripped from the upturned wing
     of wind-swept Gabriel.

A youngish pair walks wired at the arms—
     she casually ribbing
him, he lightly brushing her breast, jibbing
     their step to spare the worms

stranded along the road. Too soon, their laughter
     rises and goes
drifting toward silence. And now the young man knows
     love’s not the song, but after—

like the mute, remembered chorus of the rain
     that stains the walk
long after falling, or the lifeless stalk
     still hoisting its head of grain.

Uneasy now, she loosens from his hand.
     Their dark familiars
stare back, reflected by the passing cars,
     with speechless reprimand.

Before the chill, each chartered hell grows hotter,
     yet every burn
will teach him how to run—and how to turn
     her wine back into water."
708,Of the Divine as Absence and Single Letter,Idra Novey,"If our view were not a Holiday Inn
but a fringe of trees, I could say G here
is our greenly hidden.
                                          If we lived 
amid Joe-Pye weed and high grass 
instead of spackle and peeling plaster 
I could say perhaps
                                  I’m listening to G now 
but mean the owl, a wind playing the silo, 
a sticking sorrow,
                               any sound but the snore 
of our latest visitor on the futon. Dear G, 
please make him turn, make me kinder. 
I’m not far from unfathoming it all."
709,Pome,Elizabeth Spires,"From flowering gnarled trees 
they come, weighing down
the branches, dropping 
with a soft sound onto 
the loamy ground. Falling 
and fallen. That’s a pome.

Common as an apple. Or 
more rare. A quince or pear.
A knife paring away soft skin
exposes tart sweet flesh.
And deeper in, five seeds in a core
are there to make more pomes.

Look how it fits in my hand.
What to do? What to do?
I could give it to you.
Or leave it on the table
with a note both true and untrue:
Ceci n’est pas un poème.

I could paint it as a still life,
a small window of light 
in the top right corner
(only a dab of the whitest white),
a place to peer in and watch it
change and darken as pomes will do.

O I remember days....
Climbing the branches of a tree
ripe and heavy with pomes. 
Taking whatever I wanted.
There were always enough then.
Always enough."
710,A Postmodern Two-Step,Reginald Dwayne Betts,"Some people say prison is the country 
where life is cheaper than anywhere else;
you wouldn’t think that watching us take leave,
our caravan three deep and black against
the wine-dark asphalt, and two of three
are nothing but escorts: four uniformed
shotguns (off safety) leading and flanking
our coffle, all intent to keep us here,
and not wherever shackles and cuffs run
in this dead of morning, less than fifty miles 
from where Nat Turner dug a hole and lay
for weeks. Virginia, something noose-like then
and some say still, except for all the shit 
we did to land in this here hull and cul-
de-sac. The guard, he say “die, but don’t run”
when one of us begin to cough his lung 
up in sleep. And this is ruin. Damn these chains,
this awkward dance I do with this van. Two-step,
my body swaying back and forth, my head 
a pendulum that’s rocked by the wild riffs
of the dudes I’m riding with: them white folks know
you ain’t god body, what you commune wine
and bread? Where you from son? Red lines?
To what Onion? My eyes two caskets though,
so the voices are sheets of sound. Our van as dark
inside as out, and all the bodies black
and voices black too and I tell my god
if you have ears for this one, know I want 
no part of it, no Onions and no tears.
I tell no one, and cry my dirge. 
                                                        This place,
the cracked and scratching vinyl seats, the loud
loud talk of murder this and blanket fear
around the rest, is where I’m most at home,
but it’s beyond where prayers reach, a point
something like purgatory. I lean back
and drift in sleep as someone says, his voice
all hoarse and jacked, all broken songbird-like
all revolutions end with a L-note."
711,The Present,Jim Harrison,"The cost of flight is landing.
On this warm winter day in the southwest,
down here on the edge of the border I want
to go to France where we all came from
where the Occident was born near the ancient
caves near Lascaux. At home I’m only
sitting on the lip of this black hole, a well
that descends to the center of the earth.
With a big telescope aimed straight down
I see a red dot of fire and hear the beast howling.
My back is suppurating with disease,
the heart lurches left and right,
the brain sings its ditties.
Everywhere blank white movies wait to be seen.
The skylark dove within inches of the rocks
before it stopped and rose again.
God’s toes are buried deep in the earth.
He’s ready to run. But where?"
712,Sequence,Vijay Seshadri,"1. HELL

You’d have to be as crazy as Dante to get those down,
 the infernal hatreds.
 Shoot them. Shoot them where they live
 and then skip town.

Or stay and re-engineer 
the decrepit social contraption
to distill the 200-proof
elixir of fear

and torture the...the what 
from the what? And didn’t I promise,
under threat of self-intubation,
not to envision this

corridor, coal-tar black,
that narrows down and in
to a shattering claustrophobia attack
before opening out

to the lake of frozen shit
where the gruesome figure is discerned?
Turn around, go home.
Just to look at it is to become it.

 2. PURGATORY, THE FILM

 He was chronically out of work, why we don’t know.
 She was the second born of a set 
of estranged identical twins. They met,
hooked up, and moved in with her mother,
who managed a motel on Skyline Drive. 
But always it was the other,
the firstborn, the bad twin, the runaway, 
he imagined in the shadow
of the “Vacancy” sign
or watching through the window
below the dripping eaves
while they made love or slept.
The body is relaxed and at rest,
the mind is relaxed in its nest,
so the self that is and is not 
itself rises and leaves
to peek over the horizon, where it sees
all its psychokinetic possibilities
resolving into shapely fictions.
She was brave, nurturing, kind.
She was evil. She was out of her mind.
She was a junkie trading sex for a fix,
a chief executive, an aviatrix.
She was an angel
to the blinded and the lamed,
the less-than-upright, the infra dig.
And she was even a failure.
She went to L.A. to make it big
 and crept back home injured and ashamed.

3. PURGATORY, THE SEQUEL

They put him in jail, why we don’t know.
 They stamped him “Postponed.”
But he didn’t mind.
The screws were almost kind.
He had leisure to get his muscles toned,

mental space to regret his crimes,
and when he wasn’t fabricating license plates
he was free
to remember the beauty
that not once but a thousand times

escaped him forever, and escapes me, too:
ghosts of a mist drifting
across the face of the stars,
Jupiter triangulating 
with the crescent moon and Mars,
 prismatic fracturings in a drop of dew...

 4. HEAVEN

There’s drought on the mountain.
 Wildfires scour the hills.
So the mammal crawls down the desiccated rills
searching for the fountain,

which it finds, believe it or not,
or sort of finds. A thin silver sliver
rises from an underground river
and makes a few of the hot

rocks steam and the pebbles hiss.
Soon the mammal will drink,
but it has first 
to stop and think
its reflexive, impeccable thought:
that thinking comes down to this—
mystery, longing, thirst."
713,The Soul,Katie Ford,"It disappeared. 
It reappeared
as chimney smoke 
that burnt through carcasses
of swallows stilled,
and that it portrayed no will
was why I followed that smoke
with this pair of eyes.

It was that it didn’t need
or require my belief
that I leant upon it 
as a tired worker
upon 
a gate."
714,Southern Gothic,Rickey Laurentiis,"About the dead having available to them
all breeds of knowledge,
some pure, others wicked, especially what is
future, and the history that remains
once the waters recede, revealing the land
that couldn’t reject or contain it, and the land
that is not new, is indigo, is ancient, lived
as all the trees that fit and clothe it are lived,
simple pine, oak, grand magnolia, he said
they frighten him, that what they hold in their silences
silences: sometimes a boy will slip
from his climbing, drown but the myth knows why,
sometimes a boy will swing with the leaves."
715,Speak to Us,Katie Ford,"For all of my years, I’ve read only living signs—
bodies in jealousy, bodies in battle, 
bodies growing disease like mushroom coral.
It is tiresome, tiresome, describing 
fir cones waiting for fires to catch their human ribs 
into some slow, future forest.

My beloved, he tires of me, and he should—
my complaints the same, his recourse 
the same, invoking the broad, cool sheet suffering drapes
over the living freeze of heart after heart, 
and never by that heart’s fault—the heart did not make itself,
the face did not fashion its jutting jawbone 
to wail across the plains or beg the bare city. 

I will no longer tally the broken, ospreyed oceans, 
the figs that outlived summer 
or the tedious mineral angles and 
their suction of light. 

Have you died? Then speak. 
You must see the living 
are too small as they are, 
lonesome for more 
and in varieties of pain 
only you can bring into right view."
716,Swing Low,Rickey Laurentiis,"We aren’t the solid men.
       We bend like the number seven. 
Dig at corners, eat cobwebs, we
      are barefoot and bare-legged.
      We hang like leaves in autumn.

We aren’t the stolid men.
      We scribble in familiar ink
about sunfalls and night. We
      see the white in the sky, and sigh.
      We lie with penciled grins.

We aren’t the men, any men.
      We rip at the neck and wonder why 
while rattlers roll in. Bent 
      as a number, crooked, sundered,
      we aren’t the idle lightning 

if black thunder."
717,Torch,Lisa Williams,"when I beheld a fire win out against a hemisphere of shadows.                           —Inferno, Dante (tr. by Allen Mandelbaum)

If I could hold a fire against
a hemisphere of shadows, hold it
close, not so that damage
finds my hands, but so fire scatters
galvanizing strands, my pupils
responsive to the flames’ unbridled 
tutelage as they tell me
nothing but these little jumps
out of your definitions, small
or large or leaping, sinking, slumped...
If I could hold a fire against 
that latticework of shadows, standing
close to flames pivoting without
being singed or riveted or convinced
it is the only spirit, like a god,
making me something nailed to wood
then keep my head, then coolly draw
some backbone from that dazzle."
718,Toward what island-home am I moving,Joanna Klink,"Toward what island-home am I moving,
not wanting to marry, not wanting 
too much of that emptiness at evening, 
as when I walked through a field at dusk
and felt wide in the night.
And it was again the evening that drew me
back to the field where I was most alone,
compassed by stems and ruts, 
no light of the fixed stars, no flashing in the eyes, 
only heather pared by dry air, shedding 
a small feathered radiance when I looked away,
an expanse whose deep sleep seemed an unending 
warren I had been given, to carry out such tasks—
that I might find nothing dead.  
And it was again the evening that drew me
back to the field where I could sense no boundary—
the smell of dry earth, cool arch of my neck, the darkness 
entirely within myself.  
And when I shut my eyes there was no one.
Only weeds in drifts of stillness, only 
stalks and gliding sky.

Come, black anchor, let us not be harmed.
The deer leafing in the dark.
The old man at the table, unable to remember.
The children whose hunger is just hunger, 
and never desire."
719,The Visitor,Idra Novey,"Does no dishes, dribbles sauce 
across the floor. Is more dragon 
than spaniel, more flammable 
than fluid. Is the loosening 
in the knit of me, the mixed-fruit 
marmalade in the kitchen of me. 
Wakes my disco and inner hibiscus, 
the Hector in the ever-mess of my Troy. 
All wet mattress to my analysis,
he’s stayed the loudest and longest
of any houseguest, is calling now 
as I write this, tiny B who brings the joy."
720,You Are Not Christ,Rickey Laurentiis,"New Orleans, Louisiana

For the drowning, yes, there is always panic.
Or peace. Your body behaving finally by instinct
alone. Crossing out wonder. Crossing out
a need to know. You only feel you need to live.
That you deserve it. Even here. Even as your chest
fills with a strange new air, you will not ask 
what this means. Like prey caught in the wolf’s teeth,
but you are not the lamb. You are what’s in the lamb 
that keeps it kicking. Let it."

722,Aubade,Garrett Caples,"for Andrew Joron

the desire to show is destruction
in lessons forgot before learned
no shrunken heads hang by wires
no mourning songs of half-remembered
shutters open the width of an eyelash
it is enough for vision to run
its finger along, for access to steal
from forbidden shores the still-cold
beams of night and pack them in ice
but a child couldn’t live here nonetheless

in the morning is come a bell that summons
a fortune that reads she will soon
 cross the water and the intended instructions
which may not florish after all
she leaves a painting outside her room
and in the morning it’s gone
and not one word is spoke between them
but her father carries it to his grave
the desire to show is destruction
and we are not hung with skins
we must follow internal echoes
commit ourselves to memory"
723,Ordinary History America,Garrett Caples,"the trapdoor is closed; am finite again, but a moment ago—levitation!
purple lights the bluewater bridge turned on the oil-

an overwrought iron fence. they stood waiting like that photograph

with Dana Ward
  
  
I have so little want of activity
even writing with its pain more terrible than life
I don’t want but do because I’m kind of stupid finally
not in the way, you, Sarah know I am
nor, you reader, who think of me fishing.
Line, spindle, lure, bait. Instruments for me
are accessories, even the matchbook is only
a tiara to my eyes, the fishing lure a long
& white bracelet. Some of my
so-called friends think of me as a derelict
they always try to hold me to account.
“Tell me what happened on the drunken night in question”
On the witness stand I am a kitten
terribly cute but I can’t say a thing
about stupid, or fish, or last night.
I like to lay at the base of a hill
asleep while the shepherds work
bringing things to heel with tepid will where I source
my contempt in the index of swill.
The entries there make no mention of hell
which was sifted through the vale of tears, & fell
to make Earth, & the base of this hill where I sunbathe & murmur
‘jealous cellmate’ as my willful peers go by."
725,"#14 ""This boat you’re videotaping"" from The Poems of Gaius Valerius Catullus",Brandon Brown,"This boat you’re videotaping. You’re looking at a boat. Despite your protests that you are looking at a translation of the fourth poem in the corpus of Catullus, I assure you you are looking at this boat. Lots of bad things battered this boat. Forget about volunteering to swab its lintels. This boat denies it was minced in the Adriatic. It denies that it lit up the Cyclades with an all night buck and spill. Rhodes is horrible, noble, Thracian. Proponents of Rhodes call truce though it might be their sinuses. Where this boat is is post-boat. The word for this boat is phaselus. A phaselus was a rather long and narrow vessel, named for its resemblance to a kidney bean. This boat was built for speed. Yet this boat is sort of fragile. Lots of bad things battered this boat from the beginning of its life to now. You state it’s cracked, but I tell you to go put your stupid hands in the water. Say it again. The boat frets about its impotence, falls over dead. The boat sucks lava dexterously; yes, this boat is right-handed. Its aura chainsmokes cigarettes, looks up at Jupiter out there in space, and its beams moist. What happens below deck, and involves feet, stays below deck. I’m not literally pointing out this boat to you, I’m writing a poem about it in limping trimeters. But this is a fact: botulism is sad. Noobs lurch toward a limpid coast. And before them stands a boat, a beautiful old boat looking like a kidney bean built for speed. It sits there quiet and old, looking over the lake and thinking this lake is really limpid. The noobs all have twins."
726,Before Anything Happened the House Had No Skeleton,Karyna McGlynn,"the termites had deboned the thing
it was clean there was no saving it
 
in one bedroom a dresser with blue drawers
its peg-legs rested on pure membrane
 
a girl just stood in her underwear
ran the tips of her fingers over her ribs
 
thought greyhound no one knew no explaining
why she didn’t fall through the floor
 
the kids were drinking beer in the yard
the tetherball rope caught one girl’s throat
 
her mother’s face obscured
behind the porch screen the mesquite shadow
 
no one could make her out
her feet rested on hot sashes of dust
 
the sounds on the television were far away
as that big caliche mound looked lake a waving man
 
the president got shot
the boards stayed together for another three days
 
it was a matter of apathy or swelling
or everyone was too hot to move"

728,A Red Tricycle in the Belly of the Pool,Karyna McGlynn,"the live oak over the nursery got a disease
they could only save one limb
it wasn’t surprising; it wasn’t that kind of nursery
 
a girl rode her red tricycle around the bottom of the pool
the pool had no water; it hadn’t rained
 
the girl kept smelling her hand
it smelled like honeywheat, or the inside of a girl’s panties
 
someone said, race you
she nodded okay and pedaled like hell
after three laps no one had passed her
 
she looked over her shoulder, lost her balance
ripped her hands & knees on the blue concrete
 
the one limb on the live oak curved like a question
would she need stitches again
 
there was already ink under her skin & iodine on her tongue
or was it the other way around
 
she could see black thread bunching
sewing centipedes under her skin
 
her throat burned and she couldn’t move her legs
it wasn’t a tricycle
it was something she couldn’t get her foot out from under
 
she hated to stop or lose her shoe and, I’m sorry
the pool was full of water"
729,"[She goes, she is, she wakes the waters]",Karen Volkman,"She goes, she is, she wakes the waters
primed in their wave-form, a flux of urge
struck into oneness, the solid surge
seeking completion, and strikes and shatters
 
and is its fragments, distinction’s daughters
and now, unholding, the cleave and merge
the hew and fusing, plundering the verge
and substance is the scheme it scatters
 
and what it numbers in substantial sun.
Her hands hold many or her hands hold none.
And diving the salt will kiss a convex eye
 
and be salt fact and be the bodied sky
and that gray weight is both or beggared one,
a dead dimensional, or blue begun."
730,[Show me the body that brides its quest],Karen Volkman,"Show me the body that brides its quest,
that sleeps its seemings, tremblant inconnue,
jeweled Ophelia of diaphanous hue
in all her slippings, weed-wedded, water-dressed,
 
the sluice and swooning of her semblant rest—
the river ruptures, the weeds branch blue—
day’s jaune eyes (wide lucencies) bleed new
hollow spaces where the breathings nest,
 
irised mnemosyne, rumored as a rune.
Oh roared red pulse, errata, when you die
maiden-postured, murmur in the wrist,
 
tendrilled syllables the waters twist,
or innered element (it is an I)
the dead girl blurring in the blooded noon."
731,[Sleeping sister of a farther sky],Karen Volkman,"Sleeping sister of a farther sky,
dropped from zenith like a tender tone,
the lucid apex of a scale unknown
whose whitest whisper is an opaque cry
 
of measureless frequency, the spectral sigh
you breath, bright hydrogen and brighter zone
of fissured carbon, consummated moan
and ceaseless rapture of a brilliant why.
 
Will nothing wake you from your livid rest?
Essence of ether and astral stone
the stunned polarities your substance weaves
 
in one bright making, like a dream of leaves
in the tree’s mind, summered. Or as a brooding bone
roots constellations in the body’s nest."
732,At the Post Office,David Hernandez,"The line is long, processional, glacial,
and the attendant a giant stone, cobalt blue
with flecks of white, I’m not so much
looking at a rock but a slab of night.
The stone asks if anything inside the package
is perishable. When I say no the stone
laughs, muted thunderclap, meaning
everything decays, not just fruit
or cut flowers, but paper, ink, the CD
I burned with music, and my friend
waiting to hear the songs, some little joy
after chemo eroded the tumor. I know flesh
is temporary, and memory a tilting barn
the elements dismantle nail by nail.
I know the stone knows a millennia of rain
and wind will even grind away
his ragged face, and all of this slow erasing
is just a prelude to when the swelling
universe burns out, goes dark, holds
nothing but black holes, the bones of stars
and planets, a vast silence. The stone
is stone-faced. The stone asks how soon
I want the package delivered. As fast
as possible, I say, then start counting the days."
733,Barn Clothes,Michael Walsh,"Same size, my parents stained and tore
alike in the barn, their brown hair

ripe as cow after twelve hours of gutters.

but no wash could wring the animal from their clothes:
one pair, two pair, husband, wife, reversible."
734,Centrifugal,Douglas S. Jones,"The spider living in the bike seat has finally spun
its own spokes through the wheels.
I have seen it crawl upside down, armored
black and jigging back to the hollow frame,
have felt the stickiness break
as the tire pulls free the stitches of last night’s sewing.
We’ve ridden this bike together for a week now,
two legs in gyre by daylight, and at night,
the eight converting gears into looms, handle bars
into sails. This is how it is to be part of a cycle—
to be always in motion, and to be always
woven to something else."
735,Finding the Scarf,Wyatt Townley,"The woods are the book
we read over and over as children.
Now trees lie at angles, felled
by lightning, torn by tornados,
silvered trunks turning back

to earth. Late November light
slants through the oaks
as our small parade, father, mother, child,
shushes along, the wind searching treetops
for the last leaf. Childhood lies

on the forest floor, not evergreen
but oaken, its branches latched
to a graying sky. Here is the scarf
we left years ago like a bookmark,

meaning to return the next day,
having just turned our heads
toward a noise in the bushes,
toward the dinnerbell in the distance,

toward what we knew and did not know
we knew, in the spreading twilight
that returns changed to a changed place."
736,My Mother Goes to Vote,Judith Harris,"We walked five blocks
to the elementary school,
my mother’s high heels
crunching through playground gravel.
We entered through a side door.

Down the long corridor,
decorated with Halloween masks,
health department safety posters—
we followed the arrows
to the third grade classroom.

My mother stepped alone
into the booth, pulling the curtain behind her.
I could see only the backs of her
calves in crinkled nylons.

A partial vanishing, then reappearing
pocketbook crooked on her elbow,
our mayor’s button pinned to her lapel.
Even then I could see—to choose
is to follow what has already
been decided.

We marched back out
finding a new way back down streets
named for flowers
and accomplished men.
I said their names out loud, as we found

our way home, to the cramped house,
the devoted porch light left on,
the customary meatloaf.
I remember, in the classroom converted
into a voting place—
there were two mothers, conversing,
squeezed into the children’s desk chairs."
737,Trick or Treat,Nancy Price,"The ghost is a torn sheet,
the skeleton’s suit came from a rack in a store

For the lady wearing the hat from Salem: gum.
And a penny for each eye, Lost Soul.
They fade away with their heavy sacks.
Thanks! I yell just in time.

739,The Answer,Sara Teasdale,"When I go back to earth
And all my joyous body
Puts off the red and white
That once had been so proud,
If men should pass above
With false and feeble pity,
My dust will find a voice
To answer them aloud:

“Be still, I am content,
Take back your poor compassion—
Joy was a flame in me
Too steady to destroy.
Lithe as a bending reed
Loving the storm that sways her—
I found more joy in sorrow
Than you could find in joy.”

741,The Cement Plant,Joshua Mehigan,"The cement plant was like a huge still
nailed in gray corrugated panels
and left out forty-five years ago
in the null center of a meadow
to tax itself to remorseless death 
near a black stream and briars, where
from the moment it began to breathe,
it began falling apart and burning.
But it still went, and the men were paid.

The plant made dust. Impalpably fine,
hung in a tawny alkaline cloud,
swept into drifts against mill room piers,
frozen by rain on silo ledges,
dust was its first and its final cause.
Pinups were traced on their car windshields.
Dust gave them jobs, and killed some of them.
Late into evening their teeth grated.
Its product was dust, its problem dust.

The thing was blind to all its own ends
but the one. Men’s ordinary lives,
measured out on a scale alien 
to that on which its life was measured,
were spent in crawling the junk machine,
fitting new gaskets, screws, and bearings,
deceiving it towards the mood required
for it to avail and pay. Somehow 
it did. None cheered it. It sustained them."
742,Down in the Valley,Joshua Mehigan,"It was her first time coming home from college.
She headed downtown for a drink or two.
Her girlfriend went home early. That was Christmas. 
Now, under sapling pine trees in the clearing,
snowdrops are coming back to their old places.
They had been gone a lifetime. Now they stand,
poised like a choir on the verge of singing: 
Nature is just. There’s nothing left to fear.
The worst thing that can happen happened here."

—but I beg my rides and oh I know
these boring roads where hundreds and hundreds
of cars fade by in hundred-hundreds
of flashing windows too bright too fast
to see my face. I am steadfast
long hours o’ the morning, I am so sad.
An old-time trap, an ancient sad
horse and his farmer stop by the way,
they’ll take me one mile on my way
—out of my way—is this the Way?
I used to think I used to be happy,
but is it possible to be happy?
What is it like?—like Plato oh
we’ll copy it at large and oh
plan a city where all the distances
(where? where?) are walking distances.

744,Elegy for a Suicide,John Poch,"She always liked to blow the candles out. Fact:
there’s only so much you can do with friction
and an intentional hand before the hand burns.
The sound that scissors make in a child’s hand 
while crunching construction paper aches when 
she grows older. Even popcorn ceilings lose that style, 
that feeling of a cereal freshly drowned in milk.
Ah, the white beneath things. And the black below that.
We come down from bunk beds. We come down from
the funky reds and yellows of the spring’s summer tanager
gone in fall. We fail to see the most vivid birds
high in the trees on the other side of leaves.

Where did those sad seeds come from or how take root? 
Her departure spun out of some samara down into a maple
shadow that shadows well into night’s sweet syrup.
O host, we don’t know the words for this country,
and this country pretends we have no knife,
no guns in the bedroom, no large car for escaping
or crashing over hard hillsides or into houses. 
We stuff our faces, blank as pills, with pills.
No one wants to open that book, but it’s a book."
745,From “Five Poems”,Edward Dahlberg,"I

     He who has never tasted the grapes of Canaan can only view them from Pisgah.

      I have my tides, O sea-foamed Venus, dearer than watercress, pipkins, thyme and clymene. You once held me by the cord of my navel, but I have not died to live in Mahomet’s paradise.

      Would that I could gather up my love to me as one does one’s fate, or measure her nature as God does the sea.

      We are a weary race that hates seedtime. Poor Persephone, who is Maying springtime, and the coming up of flowers! We remember only what we seed, and Persephone goes down into the earth after Spring and Summer vegetation only because Pluto gave her pomegranate seeds to remember him, but if the seed perish, Persephone will die, and memory shall pass from the earth.

     A man of humble blood, with a soul of Kidron, needs a Rachel, but I labored for years in the weary fields for Leah.

     The world is a wound in my soul, and I have sought the living waters in meditation, and the angelical fountains in the desert of Beersheba for solitude, for what health there is in friendship comes when one is alone.

      I shed tears on the Mount of Olives because people no longer care for each other, but my friends have lacked the character for the vigil. There is no Cana wine in human affections that are not always awake, for people who do not trouble about each other are foes.

      It is humiliating being the lamb and bleating to each passerby, “Feed me!” What is the use of saying that men are stones when I know I am going to try to turn them into bread.

      I am afraid to say that people are truthful. When a man tells me he is honest I press my hand close to my heart where I keep my miserable wallet. If he says he has any goodness in him, I avoid him, for I trust nobody who has so little fear of the evils that grow and ripen in us while we imagine we have one virtuous trait. These demons lie in ambush in the thick, heady coverts of the blood, where hypocrisy and egoism fatten, waiting to mock or betray us in any moment of self-esteem.

      I have no faith in a meek man, and regard anyone that shows a humble mien as one who is preparing to make an attack upon me, for there is some brutish, nether fault in starved vanity.

      Yet once a friend leaned as gently on my coat as that disciple had on the bosom of the Saviour, and I went away, not knowing by his affection whether I was the John Christ was said to have loved most. I whispered thanks to my soul because he leaned upon me, for I shall never know who I am if I am not loved.

     Much flesh walks upon the earth void of heart and warm liver, for it is the spirit that dies soonest.

      Some men have marshland natures with mist and sea-water in their intellects, and are as sterile as the Florida earth which De Soto found in those meager, rough Indian settlements, and their tongues are fierce, reedy arrows. They wound and bleed the spirit, and their oaks and chestnut trees and acorns are wild, and a terrible, barren wind from the Atlantic blows through their blood as pitiless as the primitive rivers De Soto’s soldiers could not ford.

     Do not attempt to cross these mad, tumid rivers, boreal and brackish, for water is unstable, and you cannot link yourself to it.

      There are also inland, domestic men who are timid pulse and vetch, and though they may appear as stupid as poultry rooting in the mire, they are housed people, and they have orchards and good, tamed wine that makes men loving rather than predatory; go to them, and take little thought of their ignorance which brings forth good fruits, for here you may eat and not be on guard for the preservation of your soul.

     People who have domestic animals are patient, for atheism and the stony heart are the result of traveling: sorrow never goes anywhere. Were we as content as our forefathers were with labor in the fallow, or as a fuller with his cloth, or a drayman with his horses and mules, we would stay where we are, and that is praying.

     There are men that are birds, and their raiment is trembling feathers, for they show their souls to everyone, and everything that is ungentle or untutored or evil or mockery is as a rude stone cast at them, and they suffer all day long, or as Paul remarks they are slain every moment.

     God forgive me for my pride; though I would relinquish my own birthright for that wretched pottage of lentils which is friendship, I mistrust every mortal.

     Each day the alms I ask of heaven is not to have a new chagrin which is my daily bread.

December 1959"
746,Game,Laura Kasischke,"I thought we were playing a game
in a forest that day.
I ran as my mother chased me.

But she’d been stung by a bee.
Or bitten by a snake. 
She shouted my name, which

even as a child I knew was not
“Stop. Please. I’m dying.” 

I ran deeper 
into the bright black trees
happily
as she chased me: How 

lovely the little bits and pieces. 
The fingernails, the teeth. Even
the bombed cathedrals
being built inside of me. 

How sweet 
the eye socket. The spine. The
curious, distant possibility that God
had given courage 
to human beings
that we might 
suffer a little longer.

And by the time 

I was willing to admit that
all along
all along
I’d known it was no game

I was a grown woman, turning 
back, too late."

this feather flapping in the high mesquite
only head-high, caught by the down,
iridescent, turkey. Another
feather hugging the ditch
along the fence line and another...
A coyote somewhere naps 
happy, grinning like the feather
evolved from a leaf. What luck. 

Clouds lift above the field
as if to swallow my eye
into hunger. Good hunger.
The greatest eye must
behold me like an ember
dropped into a finch nest,
and I smoke at the mouth
like a gun dreaming in a safe
of a war it can win by virtue
of its praise. I have lost
the killer phrase I concocted
on my country walk
with the feather in my pocket.
I cock it."
748,Heir,Josephine Miles,"This gray board fence turns blue in the evening light
And the sycamores reign down upon it their diadems,
And blue and green batter in wood and stems
The stems of light
Their green and golden gems.

At once, out of a million years of energy,
All turn to flesh,—board, gate, and branch—
With that quick sunset wrench
Which seems like chance,
Out of the fashion of an entropy.

If then the flesh is yours, as now it is,
I have lost yard, sunset, and all
Into a mild greeting, and I call
The sunset to your thought, to tell it is
Parent apparent to your rich apparel.

749,Light chaff and falling leaves or a pair of feathers,Gail Wronsky,"on the ground can spook a horse who won’t flinch when faced 
with a backhoe or a pack of Harleys. I call it “horse

ophthalmology,” because it is a different kind of system—
not celestial, necessarily, but vision in which the small,

the wispy, the lightly lifted or stirring threads of existence
excite more fear than louder and larger bodies do. It’s Matthew

who said that the light of the body is the eye, and that if
the eye is healthy the whole body will be full of light. Maybe

in this case “light” can also mean “lightness.” With my eyes of
corrupted and corruptible flesh I’m afraid I see mostly darkness

by which I mean heaviness. How great is that darkness? Not 
as great as the inner weightlessness of horses whose eyes perceive, 

correctly I believe, the threat of annihilation in every windblown 
dust mote of malignant life. All these years I’ve been watching 

out warily in obvious places (in bars, in wars, in night cities and
nightmares, on furious seas). Yet what’s been trying to destroy 

me has lain hidden inside friendly-seeming breezes, behind 
soft music, beneath the carpet of small things one can barely see. 

The eye is also a lamp, says Matthew, a giver of light, bestower 
of incandescent honey, which I will pour more cautiously 

over the courses I travel from now on. What’s that whisper? 
Just the delicate sweeping away of somebody’s life."
750,The Long Hill,Sara Teasdale,"I must have passed the crest a while ago
    And now I am going down.
Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know—
    But the brambles were always catching the hem of my gown.

All the morning I thought how proud it would be
    To stand there straight as a queen—
Wrapped in the wind and the sun, with the world under me.
    But the air was dull, there was little I could have seen.

It was nearly level along the beaten track
    And the brambles caught in my gown—
But it’s no use now to think of turning back,
    The rest of the way will be only going down.

 September 1919"
751,Moon,Kathleen Jamie,"Last night, when the moon
slipped into my attic room
as an oblong of light,
I sensed she’d come to commiserate.

It was August. She traveled
with a small valise
of darkness, and the first few stars
returning to the northern sky,

and my room, it seemed,
had missed her. She pretended
an interest in the bookcase
while other objects

stirred, as in a rock pool,
with unexpected life:
strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,
the paper-crowded desk;

the books, too, appeared inclined
to open and confess.
Being sure the moon
harbored some intention,

I waited; watched for an age
her cool gaze shift
first toward a flower sketch
pinned on the far wall

then glide down to recline
along the pinewood floor,
before I’d had enough. Moon,
I said, We’re both scarred now. 

 Are they quite beyond you,
the simple words of love? Say them.
You are not my mother;
with my mother, I waited unto death."
752,My Ambition,James Laughlin,"For Wade Hall

22nd century   not just a

erudite German who ever
lived) devotes to Alber-

hope the scholar of the

22nd will lick his schol-
arly lips when he finds me

in some forgotten source
(perhaps the Obloquies of

Dreadful Edward Dahlberg)
and think here is an odd-
ball I would have liked,
immortalizing me in six

turgid lines of footnote.

 October/November 1987"
753,Nox Borealis,Campbell McGrath,"If Socrates drank his portion of hemlock willingly,
if the Appalachians have endured unending ages of erosion,
if the wind can learn to read our minds 
and moonlight moonlight as a master pickpocket,
surely we can contend with contentment as our commission.

Deer in a stubble field, small birds dreaming
unimaginable dreams in hollow trees,
even the icicles, darling, even the icicles shame us
with their stoicism, their radiant resolve. 

Listen to me now: think of something you love 
but not too dearly, so the night will steal from us
only what we can afford to lose."
754,Pentatina for Five Vowels,Campbell McGrath,"Today is a trumpet to set the hounds baying.
The past is a fox the hunters are flaying.
Nothing unspoken goes without saying.
Love’s a casino where lovers risk playing.
The future’s a marker our hearts are prepaying.

The future’s a promise there’s no guaranteeing.
Today is a fire the field mice are fleeing.
Love is a marriage of feeling and being.
The past is a mirror for wishful sightseeing.
Nothing goes missing without absenteeing.

Nothing gets cloven except by dividing.
The future is chosen by atoms colliding.
The past’s an elision forever eliding.
Today is a fog bank in which I am hiding.
Love is a burn forever debriding.

Love’s an ascent forever plateauing.
Nothing is granted except by bestowing.
Today is an anthem the cuckoos are crowing.
The future’s a convolute river onflowing.
The past is a lawn the neighbor is mowing.

The past is an answer not worth pursuing,
Nothing gets done except by the doing.
The future’s a climax forever ensuing.
Love is only won by wooing.
Today is a truce between reaping and rueing."
755,The Professor,Joshua Mehigan,"I get there early and I find a chair.
I squeeze my plastic cup of wine. I nod.
I maladroitly eat a pretzel rod
and second an opinion I don’t share.
I think: whatever else I am, I’m there.
Afterwards, I escape across the quad
into fresh air, alone again, thank god.
Nobody cares. They’re quite right not to care.

I can’t go home. Even my family 
is thoroughly contemptuous of me.
I look bad. I’m exactly how I look.
These days I never read, but no one does,
and, anyhow, I proved how smart I was.
Everything I know is from a book."
756,Releasing the Sherpas,Campbell McGrath,"The last two sherpas were the strongest,
faithful companions, their faces wind-peeled,
streaked with soot and glacier-light on the snowfield
below the summit where we stopped to rest.

The first was my body, snug in its cap of lynx-
fur, smelling of yak butter and fine mineral dirt,
agile, impetuous, broad-shouldered,
alive to the frozen bite of oxygen in the larynx.

The second was my intellect, dour and thirsty, 
furrowing its fox-like brow, my calculating brain
searching for some cairn or chasm to explain
my decision to send them back without me.

Looking down from the next, ax-cleft serac 
I saw them turn and dwindle and felt unafraid. 
Blind as a diamond, sun-pure and rarefied,
whatever I was then, there was no turning back."
757,The Second Death,Laura Kasischke,"So like the slow moss encroaching, this
 dark anxiety. In the bricks
 by now
and all along
 the shaded left side of the house.

 And the statue, behind her knee. Her
 ankle, in the cool
 space between her breasts, spreading
 in the earliest hours
 of the morning.

 Between her fingers.
Her parted lips.
That black-green
 whispering."
758,September 2011,Elizabeth Seydel Morgan,"It keeps on happening again and it will
be forgotten again until it’s September.
We’re in the tall building paying the bill

overdue to the city for gas to fuel 
our furnace. We’re thinking November—
it keeps on happening again—and we’ll

need heat. Now it’s still summer, too hot until
fall to turn off the AC. Consider
that other cloudless day, paying the bill

in City Hall. It’s way too high now, still
we pay it. Look at the line, at him, her—
it keeps on happening again and it will.

Energy’s costly. We forget it can kill.
Though some of our children can’t remember,
we in the building paying the bill

look at the date, at the window sill,
think of their choice between jump and tinder.
It keeps on happening again and it will.
We’re in the tall building, paying the bill."
759,The Span,Elizabeth Seydel Morgan,"From the old bridge we’d been stopped on, 
a little below us, it looked like a diving board.
When the girl switched her sign from Stop to Slow
I saw across the river three men standing like old-
fashioned divers at its base, newsreels we’d seen
of men in swim caps. “Hard hats,” you literal you.

You agreed with “like a diving board,” but no spring 
to it. Something below was holding it up, something
concrete. It was the business of your life. Concrete—
but for me the men were waiting their turn over there,
each to compete for the best two-and-a-half gainer
to knife the Tye River. They’d die, you said.

“That’s a fine span,” I learned, “a very long one—
they didn’t make ’em like that back then.” Or us
either, I thought as I almost saw the Hard Hat bounce
at the tip, his one knee up to his waist.
“Inspectors,” you said as we drove across, “lolly-
gagging.” Whichever. Our span is ready."
760,The Stags,Kathleen Jamie,"This is the multitude, the beasts 
you wanted to show me, drawing me 
upstream, all morning up through wind-
scoured heather to the hillcrest. 
Below us, in the next glen, is the grave 
calm brotherhood, descended 
out of winter, out of hunger, kneeling 
like the signatories of a covenant; 
their weighty, antique-polished antlers 
rising above the vegetation 
like masts in a harbor, or city spires. 
We lie close together, and though the wind
whips away our man-and-woman smell, every
stag-face seems to look toward us, toward, 
but not to us: we’re held, and hold them, 
in civil regard. I suspect you’d 
hoped to impress me, to lift to my sight 
our shared country, lead me deeper 
into what you know, but loath
to cause fear you’re already moving 
quietly away, sure I’ll go with you, 
as I would now, almost anywhere."
761,A Visit,Marie Ponsot,"“Fine bitches all, and Molly Dance...”—Djuna Barnes

Come for duty’s sake (as girls do) we watch
The sly very old woman wile away from her pious
And stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.
She pours big drinks. We think of what
Has crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh in
And muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,
Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,
Now Babel, then of ivory, of the Shulamite,
Collapsed to this keen dame moving among
Herself. She hums, she plays with used bright
Ghosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come here
My child, and feeling it, dear. A crooking finger
Shows how hot the oven is.

(Also she is alive with hate.
Also she is afraid of hell. Also, we wish
We might, illiberal, uncompassionate,
Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)

Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still
Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.
We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.
We learn time’s pleasure, catch our future and its cure.
We’re dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kin
To any after this of those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,
Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure.

 March 1958"
762,You’ve Come Back to Me,Laura Kasischke,"For G

A small thing crawling toward me
across this dark lawn. Bright
eyes the only thing I’m sure I see.

You’ve come back to me,
haven’t you, my sweet? From
long ago, and very far. Through 

crawling dark, my sweet, you’ve
come back to me, have you? Even 
smaller this time than the stars."
763,"from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 217-221",Lord Byron (George Gordon),"217
Ambition was my idol, which was broken   Before the shrines of Sorrow and of Pleasure;And the two last have left me many a token   O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I've spoken,   'Time is, Time was, Time's past', a chymic treasureIs glittering youth, which I have spent betimes—My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.     218What is the end of Fame? 'tis but to fill   A certain portion of uncertain paper:Some liken it to climbing up a hill,   Whose summit, like all hills', is lost in vapour;For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,   And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'To have, when the original is dust,A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.
  219
What are the hopes of man? old Egypt's King   Cheops erected the first pyramidAnd largest, thinking it was just the thing   To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;But somebody or other rummaging,   Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:Let not a monument give you or me hopes,Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops. 
  220
But I being fond of true philosophy,   Say very often to myself, 'Alas!All things that have been born were born to die,   And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;You've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,   And if you had it o'er again—'twould pass—So thank your stars that matters are no worse,And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.' 
  221
But for the present, gentle reader! and   Still gentler purchaser! the bard—that's I—Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,   And so your humble servant, and good bye!We meet again, if we should understand   Each other; and if not, I shall not tryYour patience further than by this short sample—'Twere well if others follow'd my example."
764,"from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 41-42",Lord Byron (George Gordon),"41
His classic studies made a little puzzle,
   Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
   But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
   And for their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,
For Donna Inez dreaded the mythology.
 
 42
Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,
   Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
   I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
   Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'"
765,"from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 47-48",Lord Byron (George Gordon),"47
Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
   And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
   He did not take such studies for restraints;
But how faith is acquired, and then insured,
   So well not one of the aforesaid paints
As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
Which make the reader envy his transgressions.
 
 48
This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—
   I can't but say that his mamma was right,
If such an education was the true one.
   She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
Her maids were old, and if she took a new one
   You might be sure she was a perfect fright,
She did this during even her husband's life—
I recommend as much to every wife."
766,"from Don Juan: Canto 1, Stanzas 60-63",Lord Byron (George Gordon),"60
 Her eye (I'm very fond of handsome eyes)
    Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
 Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
    Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
 And love than either; and there would arise
    A something in them which was not desire,
 But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
 Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole. 

 61
 Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
    Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
 Her eyebrow's shape was like the aerial bow,
    Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
 Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
    As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
 Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
 Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman. 

62
 Wedded she was some years, and to a man
    Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
 And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
    'Twere better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
 Especially in countries near the sun:
    And now I think on't, 'mi vien in mente,'
 Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
 Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

 63
 'Tis a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
    And all the fault of that indecent sun,
 Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
    But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
 That howsoever people fast and pray,
    The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
 What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
 Is much more common where the climate 's sultry."

Blood on the night soil man en route to the country prison
Blood on the sullen chair, the one that holds you with its pleasure

Blood inside the quartz, the beauty watch, the eye of the guard
Blood on the slope of names & the tattoos hidden

Blood on the Virgin, behind the veils,
Behind—in the moon angel's gold oracle hair

                    What blood is this, is it the blood of the worker rat?
                    Is it the blood of the clone governor, the city maid?
                    Why does it course in s's & z's?

Blood on the couch, made for viewing automobiles & face cream
Blood on the pin, this one going through you without any pain

Blood on the screen, the green torso queen of slavering hearts
Blood on the grandmother's wish, her tawdry stick of Texas

Blood on the daughter's breast who sews roses
Blood on the father, does anyone remember him, bluish?

                    Blood from a kitchen fresco, in thick amber strokes
                    Blood from the baby's right ear, from his ochre nose
                    What blood is this?

Blood on the fender, in the sender's shoe, in his liquor sack
Blood on the street, call it Milagro Boulevard, Mercy Lanes #9
Blood on the alien, in the alligator jacket teen boy Juan

                    There is blood, there, he says
                    Blood here too, down here, she says
                    Only blood, the Blood Mother sings

Blood driving miniature American queens stamped into rage
Blood driving rappers in Mercedes blackened & whitened in news
Blood driving the snare-eyed professor searching for her panties
Blood driving the championship husband bent in Extreme Unction

                   Blood of the orphan weasel in heat, the Calvinist farmer in wheat
                   Blood of the lettuce rebellion on the rise, the cannery worker's prize

Blood of the painted donkey forced into prostitute zebra,
Blood of the Tijuana tourist finally awake & forced into pimp sleep again

It is blood time, Sir Terminator says,
It is blood time, Sir Simpson winks,
It is blood time, Sir McVeigh weighs.

                   Her nuclear blood watch soaked, will it dry?
                   His whitish blood ring smoked, will it foam?
                   My groin blood leather roped, will it marry?
                   My wife's peasant blood spoked, will it ride again?

Blood in the tin, in the coffee bean, in the maquila oración
Blood in the language, in the wise text of the market sausage
Blood in the border web, the penal colony shed, in the bilingual yard

                    Crow blood blues perched on nothingness again
                    fly over my field, yellow-green & opal

Who will eat this speckled corn?
Who shall be born on this Wednesday war bed?

Blood in the acid theater, again, in the box office smash hit
Blood in the Corvette tank, in the crack talk crank below

Blood boat Navy blood glove Army ventricle Marines
in the cookie sex jar, camouflaged rape whalers
Roam & rumble, investigate my Mexican hoodlum blood

                    Tiny blood behind my Cuban ear, wine colored & hushed
                    Tiny blood in the death row tool, in the middle-aged corset
                    Tiny blood sampler, tiny blood, you hush up again, so tiny

Blood in the Groove Shopping Center,
In blue Appalachia river, in Detroit harness spleen

Blood in the Groove Virus machine,
In low ocean tide, in Iowa soy bean

Blood in the Groove Lynch mob orchestra,
South of Herzegovina, south, I said

Blood marching for the Immigration Patrol, prized & arrogant
Blood spawning in the dawn break of African Blood Tribes, grimacing
& multiple—multiple, I said

Blood on the Macho Hat, the one used for proper genuflections
Blood on the faithful knee, the one readied for erotic negation
Blood on the willing nerve terminal, the one open for suicide

Blood at the age of seventeen
Blood at the age of one, dumped in a Greyhound bus

Blood mute & autistic & cauterized & smuggled Mayan
& burned in border smelter tar

                    Could this be yours? Could this item belong to you?

Bouncing like bunsens from stacks a hundred feet high.
     The stench stabs at your eyeballs.
The whole sky green and yellow backdrop for the skeleton
     steel of a bombed-out town.
 
Remember the movies in grammar school? The goggled men
     doing strong things in
Showers of steel-spark? The dark screen cracking light
     and the furnace door opening with a
Blast of orange like a sunset? Or an orange?
 
It was photographed by a fairy, thrilled as a girl, or
     a Nazi who wished there were people
Behind that door (hence the remote beauty), but Sievers,
     whose old man spent most of his life in there,
Remembers a “nigger in a red T-shirt pissing into the
     black sand.”
 
It was 5 years until I could afford to recognize the ferocity.
     Friends helped me. Then I put some
Love into my house. Finally I found some quiet lakes
     and a farm where they let me shoot pheasant.
 
Standing in the boat one night I watched the lake go
     absolutely flat. Smaller than raindrops, and only
Here and there, the feeding rings of fish were visible a hundred
     yards away — and the Blue Gill caught that afternoon
Lifted from its northern lake like a tropical! Jewel at its ear
     Belly gold so bright you’d swear he had a
Light in there. His color faded with his life. A small
     green fish . . .
 
All things considered, it’s a gentle and undemanding
     planet, even here. Far gentler
Here than any of a dozen other places. The trouble is
     always and only with what we build on top of it.
 
There’s nobody else to blame. You can’t fix it and you
     can’t make it go away. It does no good appealing
To some ill-invented Thunderer
     Brooding above some unimaginable crag . . .
 
It’s ours. Right down to the last small hinge it
     all depends for its existence
Only and utterly upon our sufferance.
 
Driving back I saw Chicago rising in its gases and I
     knew again that never will the
Man be made to stand against this pitiless, unparalleled
     monstrocity. It
Snuffles on the beach of its Great Lake like a
     blind, red, rhinoceros.
It’s already running us down.
 
You can’t fix it. You can’t make it go away.
     I don’t know what you’re going to do about it,
But I know what I’m going to do about it. I’m just
     going to walk away from it. Maybe
A small part of it will die if I’m not around
 
      feeding it anymore."
774,Circle Poems,Lew Welch,"Whenever I have a day off, I write a new poem.
Does this mean you shouldn’t work, or that you
write best on your day off?
 
For example, this is the poem I wrote today.
 
 
                                     *
 
 
When he was 20, he understood some of the secrets of
life, and undertook to write them down so simply that
even an idiot could understand.
“For,” he reasoned, “if I can’t do that, I don’t
understand it myself.”
 
He proved himself right.
When he was 50, he didn’t understand it himself.
 
 
                                      *
 
 
“Why is it,” he said, “that no matter what you say,
a woman always takes it personally?”
 
“I never do,” she said.
 
 
                                      *
 
 
John said, “Then I met that short fat guy with the
neat little beard, with a name like dawn.”
 
“You mean George Abend?”
 
“Yeah.”
 
“Abend means evening.”

 
                                     *"
775,[I Saw Myself],Lew Welch,"I saw myself
a ring of bone
in the clear stream
of all of it
 
and vowed,
always to be open to it
that all of it
might flow through
 
and then heard
“ring of bone” where
ring is what a
 
bell does"
776,"Springtime in the Rockies, Lichen",Lew Welch,"All these years I overlooked them in the
racket of the rest, this
symbiotic splash of plant and fungus feeding
on rock, on sun, a little moisture, air —
tiny acid-factories dissolving
salt from living rocks and
eating them.
 
Here they are, blooming!
Trail rock, talus and scree, all dusted with it:
rust, ivory, brilliant yellow-green, and
cliffs like murals!
Huge panels streaked and patched, quietly
with shooting-stars and lupine at the base.
 
Closer, with the glass, a city of cups!
Clumps of mushrooms and where do the
plants begin? Why are they doing this?
In this big sky and all around me peaks &
the melting glaciers, why am I made to
kneel and peer at Tiny?
 
These are the stamps of the final envelope.
 
How can the poisons reach them?
In such thin air, how can they care for the
loss of a million breaths?
What, possibly, could make their ground more bare?
 
Let it all die.
 
The hushed globe will wait and wait for
what is now so small and slow to
open it again.
 
As now, indeed, it opens it again, this
scentless velvet,
crumbler-of-the-rocks,
 
this Lichen!"
777,Wobbly Rock,Lew Welch,"for Gary Snyder

                                     and sat himself

It’s a real rock
 
        (believe this first)
 
Resting on actual sand at the surf’s edge:
Muir Beach, California
 
        (like everything else I have
        somebody showed it to me and I found it by myself)
 
Hard common stone
Size of the largest haystack
It moves when hit by waves
Actually shudders
 
        (even a good gust of wind will do it
        if you sit real still and keep your mouth shut)
 
Notched to certain center it
Yields and then comes back to it:
 
Wobbly tons
 
 
        2.
Sitting here you look below to other rocks
Precisely placed as rocks of Ryoanji:
Foam like swept stones
 
        (the mind getting it all confused again:
        “snow like frosting on a cake”
        “rose so beautiful it don’t look real”)
 
Isn’t there a clear example here
Stone garden shown to me by
Berkeley painter I never met
A thousand books and somebody else’s boatride ROCKS
 
       (garden)
  
EYE
 
        (nearly empty despite this clutter-image all
        the opposites cancelling out a
        CIRCULAR process: Frosting-snow)
 
Or think of the monks who made it 4 hundred 50 years ago
Lugged the boulders from the sea
Swept to foam original gravelstone from sea
 
        (first saw it, even then, when finally they
        all looked up the
        instant AFTER it was made)
 
And now all rocks are different and
All the spaces in between
 
        (which includes about everything)
 
The instant
After it is made

 I have been in many shapes before I attained congenial form
All those years on the beach, lifetimes . . .
 
When I was a boy I used to watch the Pelican:
It always seemed his wings broke
And he dropped, like scissors, in the sea . . .
Night fire flicking the shale cliff
Balls tight as a cat after the cold swim
Her young snatch sandy . . .
 
                       I have travelled
                       I have made a circuit
                       I have lived in 14 cities
                       I have been a word in a book
                       I have been a book originally

Yesterday the weather was nice there were lots of people
Today it rains, the only other figure is far up the beach
 
        (by the curve of his body I know he leans against
        the tug of his fishingline: there is no separation)
 
Yesterday they gathered and broke gathered and broke like
Feeding swallows dipped down to pick up something ran back to
Show it
And a young girl with jeans rolled to mid-thigh ran
Splashing in the rain creek
 
        “They’re all so damned happy—
         why can’t they admit it?”
 
Easy enough until a little rain shuts beaches down . . .
 
 
Did it mean nothing to you Animal that turns this
Planet to a smoky rock?
Back among your quarrels
How can I remind you of your gentleness?
 
        Jeans are washed
        Shells all lost or broken
        Driftwood sits in shadow boxes on a tracthouse wall
 
Like swallows you were, gathering
Like people I wish for . . .
 
 
        cannot even tell this to that fisherman
 
  
        5.
3 of us in a boat the size of a bathtub   .   pitching in
slow waves   .   fish poles over the side   .   oars
 
We rounded a point of rock and entered a small cove
 
Below us:
                 fronds of kelp
                 fish
                 crustaceans
                eels
Then us
                then rocks at the cliff’s base
                starfish
                (hundreds of them sunning themselves)
                final starfish on the highest rock then
Cliff
                4 feet up the cliff a flower
                grass
                further up more grass
                grass over the cliff’s edge
                branch of pine then
Far up the sky
 
                a hawk
 
Clutching to our chip we are jittering in a spectrum
Hung in the film of this narrow band
Green
                to our eyes only
 
  
        6.
On a trail not far from here
Walking in meditation
We entered a dark grove
And I lost all separation in step with the
Eucalyptus as the trail walked back beneath me
 
Does it need to be that dark or is
Darkness only its occasion
Finding it by ourselves knowing
Of course
Somebody else was there before . . .
 
I like playing that game
Standing on a high rock looking way out over it all:
 
                               “I think I’ll call it the Pacific”
 
 
Wind water
Wave rock
Sea sand
 
 
                  (there is no separation)
 
Wind that wets my lips is salt
Sea breaking within me balanced as the
Sea that floods these rocks. Rock
Returning to the sea, easily, as
Sea once rose from it. It
Is a sea rock
 
                  (easily)
 
 
I am
Rocked by the sea"
778,Artless,Brenda Shaughnessy,"is my heart. A stranger
berry there never was,
tartless.
 
Gone sour in the sun,
in the sunroom or moonroof,
roofless.
 
No poetry. Plain. No
fresh, special recipe
to bless.
 
All I’ve ever made
with these hands
and life, less
 
substance, more rind.
Mostly rim and trim,
meatless
 
but making much smoke
in the old smokehouse,
no less.
 
Fatted from the day,
overripe and even
toxic at eve. Nonetheless,
 
in the end, if you must
know, if I must bend,
waistless,
 
to that excruciation.
No marvel, no harvest
left me speechless,
 
yet I find myself
somehow with heart,
aloneless.
 
With heart,
fighting fire with fire,
fightless.
 
That loud hub of us,
meat stub of us, beating us
senseless.
 
Spectacular in its way,
its way of not seeing,
congealing dayless
 
but in everydayness.
In that hopeful haunting
(a lesser
 
way of saying
in darkness) there is
silencelessness
 
for the pressing question.
Heart, what art you?
War, star, part? Or less:
 
 playing a part, staying apart
from the one who loves,
loveless."
779,Liquid Flesh,Brenda Shaughnessy,"In a light chocolatine room
with blackout windows,
a loud clock drowns in soft dawn’s
 
syllables, crisscrossed
with a broken cloudiness
I’d choose as my own bedcovers
 
but cannot. My choice of sleep
or sky has no music of its own.
There’s no “its own” while the baby cries.
 
Oh, the baby cries. He howls and claws
like a wrongly minor red wolf
who doesn’t know his mother.
 
I know I am his mother, but I can’t
quite click on the word’s essential aspects,
can’t denude the flora
 
or disrobe the kind of housecoat
“mother” always is. Something
cunty, something used.
 
Whatever meaning the word itself
is covering, like underwear,
that meaning is so mere and meager
 
this morning. Mother. Baby.
Chicken and egg. It’s so obnoxious
of me: I was an egg
 
who had  an egg
and now I’m a chicken,
as usual scooping up
 
both possibilities,
or what I used to call
possibilities. I used
 
to be this way, so ontologically
greedy, wanting to be it all.
Serves me right.
 
My belief in the fluidity
of the self turns out to mean
my me is a flow of wellwater,
                                                   
without the well, or the bucket,
a hole dug and seeping.
A kind of unwell, where
 
the ground reabsorbs
what it was displaced to give.
The drain gives meaning to the sieve.
 
As I said: a chicken who still
wants to be all potential.
Someone who springs
 
and falls, who cannot see
how many of us I have
in me—and I do not like them all.
 
Do I like us? Can I love us?
If anyone comes
first it’s him, but how can that be?
 
I was here way, way first.
I have the breasts, godawful, and he
the lungs and we share the despair.
 
For we are a we, aren’t we? We split
a self in such a way that there isn’t
enough for either of us.
 
The father of the baby is sleepy
and present in his way, in the way
of fathers. He is devoted like
 
few fathers, and maybe hurts
like I hurt, like no fathers.
I don’t know what someone else
 
feels, not even these someones
who are also me. Do they hurt
like I do?  Why can’t they
 
tell me, or morse or sign: let
me know they know where and how
and why it hurts? Or something?
 
What is the point of other people,
being so separate, if we can’t
help a person get that pain
 
will stick its shiv into anything,
just to get rid of the weapon
and because it can? For if we share
 
ourselves then they, too, must
also be in so much pain.
I can hear it. Oh, my loves.
 
The wood of the crib, the white
glow of the milk (which must
have siphoned off the one
 
and only pure part of me, leaving
me with what, toxicity
or sin or mush?), the awful softness.
 
I’ve been melted into something
too easy to spill. I make more
and more of myself in order
 
to make more and more of the baby.
He takes it, this making. And somehow
he’s made more of me, too.
 
I’m a mother now.
I run to the bathroom, run
to the kitchen, run to the crib
 
and I’m not even running.
These places just scare up as needed,
the wires that move my hands
 
to the sink, to the baby,
to the breast are electrical.
I’m in shock.
 
One must be in shock to say so,
as if one’s own state is assessable,
like a car accident or Minnesota taxes.
 
A total disaster, this sack of liquid
flesh which yowls and leaks
and I’m talking about me
 
not the baby. Me, this puddle
of a middle, this utilized vessel,
cracked hull, divine
 
design. It’s how it works. It’s how
we all got here. Deform
following the function . . .
 
 But what about me? I whisper
secretly and to think,
around these parts used to be
 
the joyful place of sex,
what is now this intimate
terror and squalor.
 
My eyes burned out at three a.m. and again
at six and eleven. This is why the clock
is drowning, as I said earlier.
 
I’m trying to explain it.
I repeat myself, or haven’t I already?
Tiny self, along with a tiny self.
 
I’ll say it: he hurt me, this new
babe, then and now.
Perhaps he always will,
 
though thoughts of the future
seem like science fiction novels
I never finished reading.
 
Their ends like red nerves
chopped off by cleaver, not aliens,
this very moment, saving nothing for later.
 
He howls with such fury and clarity
I must believe him.
No god has the power
 
to make me believe anything,
yet I happen to know
this baby knows a way out.
 
This dark hole closing in on me
all around: he’ll show me
how to get through
 
the shock and the godlessness
and the rictus of crushed flesh,
into the rest of my life."
780,Magi,Brenda Shaughnessy,"If only you’d been a better mother.
 
 How could I have been a better mother?
 I would have needed a better self,
 and that is a gift I never received.
  
So you’re saying it’s someone else’s fault?
 
 The gift of having had a better mother myself,
 my own mother having had a better mother herself.
 The gift that keeps on not being given.
  
Who was supposed to give it?
 
 How am I supposed to know?
  
Well, how am I supposed to live?
 
 I suppose you must live as if you had been
 given better to live with. Comb your hair, for instance.
  
I cut off my hair, to sell for the money
to buy you what you wanted.
 
 I wanted nothing but your happiness.
 
I can’t give you that!
What would Jesus do?
He had a weird mother too . . .
 
 Use the myrrh, the frankincense, as if
 it were given unconditionally, your birthright.
  
It’s a riddle.
 
 All gifts are a riddle, all lives are
 in the middle of mother-lives.
  
But it’s always winter in this world.
There is no end to ending.
 
 The season of giving, the season
 when the bears are never cold,
 because they are sleeping.
  
The bears are never cold, Mama,
but I am one cold, cold bear."
781,Our Andromeda,Brenda Shaughnessy,"When we get to Andromeda, Cal,
you’ll have the babyhood you deserved,
all the groping at light sockets
 
and putting sand in your mouth
and learning to say Mama and I want
and sprinting down the yard
 
as if to show me how you were leaving
me for the newest outpost of Cal.
You’ll get the chance to walk
 
without pain, as if such a thing
were a matter of choosing a song
over a book, of napping at noon
 
instead of fighting it. You’ll have
the chance to fight every nap,
every grown-up decision that bugs
 
you, and it will be a fair fight, this time,
Cal, in Andromeda. You will win.
 
                        ●
 
In Andromeda there would be no
sleepy midwife who doesn’t know
her own weakness, no attending
 
nurse who defers like a serf
to the sleepy midwife, no absent
obstetrician, no fetal heart monitor
 
broken and ignored, no sloppy
hospital where everyone checks
their own boxes and only consults
 
the check marks when making
decisions that will hurt us, Cal.
None of those individual segments
 
will be there in Andromeda,
no segments to constitute the worm
that burrowed into our bodies
 
and almost killed us. The worm
that is supposed to return us back
to Earth is supposed to come after
 
we die, not when we are giving birth
and being born. But even in the Milky
Way, we did manage to get you born;
 
and I will never forget the spark,
the ping of mind, the sudden gift
from nowhere that told me what I had
 
to do to push you out. I had
no force left in me but a voice
in my head, “Love. Love!” A command.
 
The kind of love we cannot understand,
so concentrated that had it been made
of blood it would be compressed
 
into a pure black diamond
as large as a galaxy and as heavy
as a crushed star.
 
The eye would explode from looking at it.
The mouth would attach itself
like a leech and fall off, dead.
 
LOVE. Over and over that voice told me
what to think and do and what to use
and finally, it worked.
 
It cracked me open with the muscle
of a Roman god’s shattering
fist and it was the god of war or the sea
 
called in for the emergency, on alien
wires by some Andromedan operator.
This is how you were born.
 
You were hardly alive, hardly you,
horribly slim-chanced. I blacked out
hard but I heard you were blue.
 
That voice that told me what to do
came from Andromeda. It’s the only truth.
There wasn’t a soul in that hospital
 
room told me a single thing anywhere
near as true. It was Andromedan
love that delivered you.
 
                        ●
 
Wait till you see the doctors in Andromeda,
Cal. Yes, the doctors. It’s not the afterlife,
after all, but a different life.
 
The doctors are whole-organism empaths,
a little like Troi on The Next Generation
but with gifts in all areas of the sensate self.
 
Not just mental or emotional empathy
but physiological. The doctors know how
you feel. They put their hands on you
 
and their own spleen aches, or their spirit
is tired, tendon bruised, breast malignanced,
et cetera. The patient’s ills course
 
through the doctor’s body as information,
reliable at last. There are no misdiagnoses
or cursory dismissals as if the patient
 
were a whiny dog who demands another
biscuit. Or shooting in the dark like good
Dr. Shtep in the NICU, when you were
 
trying to begin living, who asked me
whether I had taken street drugs. What else
could explain your catastrophic entrance
 
into the human fold of the Milky Way
but the gross ignorance and disregard
of me, not her colleagues? Not even a god
 
we’d never share. The doctors there
are more like angels are supposed to be,
when they breathe you can sleep peacefully.
 
You might be surprised to hear that illness
occurs on Andromeda. That the field
of medicine is still a necessary patch of land.
 
Did you think I was telling you a fairy tale,
Cal? Trying to get some religious parables
into your already impassioned childhood
 
and indoctrinate you toward the obligations
of heaven? I am not. People still get sick
in Andromeda, and woe and death
 
and grief arrive each day like packets
of mail through a slot in the door.
How could it be otherwise? It is life,
 
after all. And despite what the religious
on Earth try to prove, no one can choose
life. We can only choose choices.
 
                        ●
 
People get sick in Andromeda.
The difference is that people taking
care of the sick don’t pretend
 
they know what they do not
and cannot know. In Andromeda,
everybody knows what they
 
need to know. Even doctors,
even patients. Even, yes, insurance
companies that don’t even use
 
the word “claim,” certainly not in the form
of a form, in their business,
because it’s just rude and heartless
 
to hurt further a hurt person by making
them shout in the wind, wondering
whether their pain will be approved, deemed
 
real, awarded validation in the form
of not bankrupting the sufferer instantly
with avalanching bills. They know that there.
 
We don’t even need to pack our bags,
Cal. I can’t be sure but how much
you want to bet they have better bags, too?
 
                        ●
 
You’ll learn to read so much more easily there,
Cal! You’ll be able to see the letters
better in that atmosphere.
 
Maybe their alphabet has twenty-six, or maybe
thousands like Chinese characters.
It won’t matter because your vision
 
will delineate even the finest fifteen-stroke
pictogram and you will laugh and laugh
at how the letter O looks like an open mouth
 
in your old language. How childish that will
seem! Your beautiful eyes may change color
with all the perfect seeing you do.
 
Maybe we’ll miss the aqua ring around
sandy-colored irises flecked with gray and green,
little tropical islands studded
 
with prehistoric boulders and effusive flora,
encircled by rich, bright ocean.
Perhaps the new air in Andromeda will turn
 
them into brown and gray buildings,
a city in which to flick on all the lights
in a skyscraper so you can read
 
so far into the night I call from the next room:
“That’s enough, Cal. The book will still
be there tomorrow. Time for sleep.”
 
                        ●
 
And yes, Cal, you can roll your eyes at me,
your frumpy old mom with her wacky
idea. I do believe in Andromeda.
 
You don’t have to. I’ll believe hard enough
for the both of us.
Because it’s all my fault, you see.
 
I’m the one who joined that cult
of expectant mothers
who felt ourselves too delicate
 
and optimistic to entertain the notion,
as if I were inviting it to an unpleasant
afternoon tea, of something going wrong
 
with the birth of my child. Like so many
others, I thought it wouldn’t happen
to me. In a way, it didn’t happen to me.
 
It happened to you. And because
I wouldn’t invite the terrible guests
into my psyche for goddamned tea,
 
I wasn’t careful enough. I thought
my experience of childbirth
was a consideration. I thought
 
I was playing it safe by having the Best
Midwife, one who truly understood
the beauty and horror of childbirth
 
and who would take my side
in the ordeal (I didn’t know that meant
she’d take my side against you!)
 
and who would be like a sister
to me, an expert sister and nurse and doctor
and goddess of natal wisdom
 
all in one, with the extra precaution
of planning to deliver in a hospital,
in case the tea-guests arrived
 
without invitation. I thought the hospital
was a real hospital, too. That it knew
what it was doing and had a legal
 
and moral obligation to know
what it was doing. I thought that
since I was so healthy, and you were
 
growing you beautifully, and all the tests
and charts and balances were perfect,
that I was doing everything right.
 
I was arrogant. I was selfish. I wanted
to do it all correctly as if I were building
a model birdhouse at summer camp.
 
I was wrong. I was wrong to see the other
new mothers sighing over their sore
perinea and healthy infants
 
and believe that I would be like them.
Since when have I ever believed I was like
anyone else? Only when it served me,
 
Cal. I can blame just about anyone for what
happened to you, but ultimately it was my job
to get you into this world safely. And I failed.
 
There is no other way to look at it.
The other day I was walking down Court Street
in my neighborhood and saw a mother,
 
her child in a stroller. We were all stopped at
the same corner, waiting for the light
to change, to cross the street.
 
The mother was craning her neck to the left
to watch for cars, her stroller pushed out
so far ahead of her it was already
 
in the street, ready to go, when an unseen car
zipped fast past us, dangerously close
to her child, and the first thing the mother did
 
was turn to me and say, panicked,
“Did you see that? He didn’t even have the light!”
But I couldn’t feel any sympathy for her.
 
In fact, I recoiled from her safe and lucky outrage.
It’s not the driver’s fucking job to ensure
her child grows up safely. She could be right
 
and the driver wrong and her kid dead.
Two out of three is what happened instead.
She should hold him a little tighter
 
than usual and not waste this lesson
on being angry at a car. But I said nothing,
and, disgusted, wasted my own anger on her.
 
                        ●
 
I suppose I could blame God. That’s what cowards
do, the lazy. Like people who pretend to be
so abysmally unskilled at cooking
 
that someone else feeds them throughout life.
Those people are always the pickiest eaters,
have you noticed?
 
But let’s say I won’t eat potato or dairy and I can’t
tolerate onion, eggs or wheat,
what exactly would I be blaming God for?
 
A mistake, misjudgment, an oversight (a word
that has always amused me, its simultaneously
opposite meanings) or utter cruelty?
 
Weakness? Naptime? Drunk driving?
Vengefulness? Power-madness? Experimenting
with karma, playing with matches,
 
autopilot? Stupidity, quotas, just taking
orders? Mixing up the card files Comedy
and Tragedy? An inept assistant who
 
has since been fired? Poor people-skills?
Forgetfulness? Had a headache?
A cover-up? Setting things in motion so that
 
this poem would be written? Overworked,
underpaid? The system being broken?
Technical difficulties? Couldn’t find remote?
 
Track-work, electrical storm, hurricane,
prayer-lines jammed by the devout,
new policies, change of direction within
 
the administration? On vacation, paternity
leave, sick leave, personal day, long-term
disability, short-term disability, layoffs?
 
Who am I to underestimate God in this way?
To imply he’s some bumbling Joe,
working stiff trying to do an honest day’s work?
 
I mean really. Who knows his workings?
If I don’t know what to blame him for,
how can I blame him at all?
 
Perhaps there was never a flaw in the first place,
no mistakes. Perhaps God is perfect,
utterly blameless. He is what he is. Evil.

The gods of Andromeda, however benevolent,
cannot answer unless called.
 
They don’t operate like Milky Way God,
who doesn’t answer at all,
 
who is always busy offline, jetskiing
on our waterbodies, our handsqueezed
 
oceans of salt water, competing in dressage
though he always spooks the horses.
 
In those days when I would call and call
into the stupid air, if I ate something
 
sweet I would begin to cry, overwhelmed
by how small comfort had become.
 
                        ●
 
So you see, Cal, we’re not in particularly
good hands here. Not mine, helpless
and late, not even yours,
 
tiny, graceful stations the train lines
keep skipping though we’ve all
been waiting in the rain.
 
We will find our kind in Andromeda,
we will become our true selves.
I will be the mother who
 
never hurt you, and you will have your
childhood back in full blossom,
whole hog. We might not know
 
who we are at first, there, without
our terrible pain. But no flower
knows the ocean.
 
The sea can never find the forest,
though it can see the trees.
The succulent has no bud for salt
 
but one mile away the deer lick
and lick as if the sea
were in its newborn body,
 
replenishing the kelp of the hoof.
Though a sea would as soon
drown a deer as regenerate it,
 
there’s a patch of mercy, sweetly
skewing between the two.
The new wind is already in us, older sister
 
to us all, blowing windfall and garbage
alike to those who do not deserve
either gifts or refuse.

And then of course, there were the friends.
It’s amazing how the ones without children
leapt to their feet in anguish
 
and keened, utterly genuine and broken,
made their way to our apartment with stews
and wine and tears, fruit and olive oil
 
and kindness so beautiful it wasn’t of this world.
While our own families, our parents,
seemed so stunned (as if by a stun gun)
 
by their own fear that they receded
into an ether, the veiled planet Venus
for all I understood, some bright
 
occasional visitation and months
of silence. And, oh, the friends with precious
children. The ones who withheld,
 
thin-lipped. The most articulate,
sensitive souls suddenly bumbled,
tongue-tied, unable to say anything at all
 
but the weakest thing, the things that
actually made everything worse.
 We’re so scared for you. We’re so sad for you.
  
As if our new child had died. I remembered
so vividly the ecstatic leaps of joy
I’d made without condition,
 
when their children were born. I knew
from several occasions that the most basic
thing to say was: Congratulations!
  
Because our beautiful baby boy
was in fact alive. I heard mostly silence
from the parents of those kids I’d celebrated.
 
Why on earth would it be the closest,
dearest friends to shit the most toxically
on a sad new family struggling to find
 
blessing where blessing were?
I wondered. It seemed to me that those
with children could ill afford
 
to sympathize—we were their nightmares—
how could they not be half-glad
it happened to us and not to them,
 
our misfortune statistically
tweaking the odds of misfortune
in their favor.
 
But the guilt of that relief
showed on their faces. A sight
I’ll never forget.
 
Of course, our crisis doesn’t actually
mean anything for the likelihood
of others’. It’s all a trick
 
on the parent-heart, and we all fall for it,
how else to sleep? When I was advising
a dear student about her chances
 
of becoming a Rhodes scholar,
there were many grueling numbers
and pairs of numbers meant to terrify:
 
forty thousand applicants for twenty-four scholarships,
for example. But once she was a finalist,
I told her: your odds are now 50:50.
 
Not 852:1. Either you get it or you don’t.
Yes, parents. I wish that my son’s pain
meant your child would be spared,
 
but my son is not Christ. And I am no
damn Pietà Mary. In spite of our proximity,
your kid is just as likely to be next. 50:50.
 
By the way, the student didn’t end up
a Rhodes scholar, and I told her
that, for a poet, the experience
 
of not winning the prize was going to be
more useful than anything else
thus far. Oh, but paltry usefulness!
  
The uses of disappointment are shit
when you just want the big damn prize
or want your child to be able to move
 
his limbs and talk. Back to the friends,
though, since this is the only place
I can go back to them, it seemed
 
to me that those most frightened
not only for their children but about
their places in the world, they were the most
 
grindingly inept, the least able to drum up
compassion. Those gunning for tenure
with little achievement to support it,
 
stay-at-home moms who had once
been talented but were now pretending
they were not in order to “raise a family”
 
and to slide into inanity. I don’t know what to
make of such spiritual inertia but it seems
like the same stuff racism’s made of:
 
fear of difference: As long as it’s not me,
 I don’t have to know anything about it.
 As long as they stay the hell away from me,
  
 it never has to be me. As long as they stay
weak enough they can believe they will never
be gutted by this particular pain. Not my
  
 child, hurt like that. As long as they seem
incapable of handling such trauma,
God will never force them to.
 
Secret, smug believers! God never gives you
 more than you can bear, they like to say, as if
the strong should be punished for their strength:
 
We can bear it. So we got it.
But what about my baby? How weak does
a newborn have to be to escape God’s burdens?
 
And why press down so hard on Cal when
it was I who grossly claimed superhuman strength:
 I know I can deliver him, I know I can
  
 push. I don’t care how much pain I’m in,
 I can handle it! I can do it! I’m the strongest
 fucking woman in the world!
  
When in fact, if I had let myself be weak,
a C-section would have kept Cal safe
and I’d never have seen the true spirit
 
of some of my once-close friends.
It’s like that old college saying:
Alcohol kills brain cells, but only the weak ones.
 
I’m certain that I’m merely, unadmirably,
jealous of these friends who certainly
have their own problems,
 
just not the problem of an injured child,
and I have an uncomfortable,
oozing rage, as if I’d pissed myself
 
and had to sit in it. Rage that those
who are so fearful of my pain are the ones
who will be most spared it in their own lives.
 
Let them be poor, then, let them continue
their sexless marriages! Give them
a number of “scares” after which
 
everything will be fine. A surgery or two.
Misery. Even give them the illnesses
and deaths of their own worthless
 
parents. These are the mute friends
whose children will be spared.
May they suffer every other misfortune!
 
I probably shouldn’t be telling you
such ugly, monstrous things, Cal,
and I’m not. I’m telling the Andromedans,
 
to plea for a place in their galaxy.
I want to tell them I am among weak
 people here, and I am strong,
  
 and I don’t want to be strong anymore.
 Let me be weak in your world,
 among kind people who are not afraid.
  
We’ll just have to convince them
that we belong there, Cal, though I’m worried.
I’ve become bitter and angry,
 
not at all the kind of citizen I imagine
they’d honor with a new beginning.
But then, “beginning” begins with “beg.”
 
                        ●
 
Okay, the truth?
 
I’ve been wrong or I’ve been lying
or I’ve been ignorant. It doesn’t matter
which. But now it’s time to give it up.
 
You came from Andromeda, Cal,
that other galaxy. Came to me, to us,
the moment you were born,
 
when the membrane between
worlds snapped and all that alien love
flooded my body. It came from you.
 
There was awful confusion because
you didn’t seem to be of this world
and the ordinary humans
 
didn’t know what to do. Not even me.
Mommy and her stories, those fairy
tales we have here,
 
wretched and unending, children
lost in the woods. No wonder you’ve
always looked at me so quizzically,
 
a story like that is too tiny to contain
Andromedan you, lost in the Milky Way,
magical boy weak from his first
 
intergalactic journey to my arms.
I found you, didn’t I? I am here.
We found each other, we are here.
 
And here is where we belong, for here
is where you are you. Exactly you.
Not some other boy in some other world.
 
I was wrong to mourn so, he deserves
 better and so forth. You are better.
Better than any lesser truth I could invent.
 
I opened my eyes from that long dream
to find you here, my perfect child.
You taught me the truth, Cal.
 
 Accept the truth from whoever gives it,
the ancients said to your people.
The truth is you are the truth,
 
a child born to a liar who is learning
to change. A dashing boy who may never
walk who traveled so far
 
to be here. A joyful boy who may never
talk who ruthlessly teaches
the teacher the truth
 
about where children really live.
Where you are alive. You are the most
perfect Calvin Makoto Teicher
 
of the Universe, a tough, funny
beauty of a boy who holds my hand
and blinks his eyes until I’m
 
excruciated, mad with love.
How hard it was for you to convince
me that I deserved that love.
 
My glorious son! A mother’s boast
is never merely delusion. A mother
knows, if she can forgive herself
 
for not knowing. I know now, Cal.
Your frail arms are perfect arms.
Your uncertain eyes, perfect eyes.
 
Your anguish, your illness, your pain.
Your difficulty, your discovery. Your joy
is my joy and it is a perfect, boundless joy.
 
God must exist, a God for me after all,
and he must be good, everlastingly so,
to have given you to me.
 
I don’t need any more proof than this.
You in my arms, your little searching fingers
on my face. Wistful, graceful
 
stars on a wet, clear night.
Galaxies exploding everywhere
around us, exploding in us,
 
Cal, faster than the lightest light,
so much faster than love,
and our Andromeda, that dream,
 
I can feel it living in us like we
are its home. Like it remembers us
from its own childhood.
 
Oh, maybe, Cal, we are home,
if God will let us live here,
with Andromeda inside us,
 
doesn’t it seem we belong?
Now and then, will you help me belong
here, in this place where you became
 
my child, and I your mother
out of some instant of mystery
of crash and matter
 
scattered through the cosmos,
God-scooped and poured toward
our bodies. With so much love,
 
somehow. I am so tired
I cannot beat my own heart anymore.
Cal, shall we stay? Oh let’s stay.
 
We’ve only just arrived here,
rightly, whirling and weeping,
freely, breathing, brightly born."
782,Command Filter with Negative Entailment,Steve McCaffery,A bridge is a passage between two banks. On Saturdays both banks are closed. A well is located in a wall of sound. But space is not the stake and suddenly both travellers fall in. Now draw a line between some water and their eyes. Express it as the border of a reservoir. The term ears stands ready to attack. Attach it then repeat the phrase my body lives inside a closed shed. The nose with this noise invents a scale. The cottage is attempts and tries to break at random or at noon a forest hidden by a single tree. Narrative dilates sporadic or clairvoyant in a place where bed becomes the meaning of the rest. Now say embrace me. Motors trivialize. Eighty-six windows show the noun to be a house. The heart is now a hole in space that falls across and leaves a certain number. Forget the thirds in this and the silhouettes change place. You can no longer have a choice. You start at zero by the church called word in the forest by a beach beyond the sea between a fingernail at the moment logic begins. Basic liquids add a soup. Now change it. Write down I can no longer state a model is at work. Then make filters for each body. Draw all the composition off. Forbid readers to leave. This sea as a mixture and the sand relating questions to the horizontal movements of a prebiotic plan. You are now discovering that concrete form involves both circulation and the clinamen. Start to weave and you’ll connect this space. Now try to say the eye is paradoxical so that all future lines repeat a plate. Nothing is narrative. Now alter it. The equator drops and float upstream. A pluralist sidewalk remains. Go back to the start. The Saturdays stay close to a catastrophic separation. The bridge is now a son who kills the father at a crossroad. In the well of the week drops the son’s name. Add wings to it. Now set out all the other links to constitute a set of probable ideas. The crevice of the lip connects a writing that’s as still as ink. This final switch is exactly what’s happening. The constant factor in a cloud.

the tawdry masks of women, flirting with my nephew,
 
red and green lights, shop windows piled high, gold
glistered skeletal mannequins in slips of iridescent silk.
 
At night in the wind blowing over the Pont Marie I hear
Camille Claudel crying from the walls of her studio,
 
and two days before Christmas Elliot and I stand
miraculously alone before La Gioconde, follow her eyes,
 
cracked surface of her skin like softest sand before the deep
water of her mouth, and later standing in the cold

that in all things she tries to remain neutral, neutre, neutre,
 
 neutre, the only word finally I understand in the barrage

neutral, passion welling up in my heart for the exhausted maids,
dapper men in berets, the madwoman on the PC bus,
 
screaming, Salope, salope, as she descends at the Pont d’Ivry
and everyone on the bus looking at each other, Whore?
 
 Who’s the whore here? or the chic older woman, leather pants
baggy on her skinny shanks, reading a battered paperback

the master himself as Chaucer, spinning his ribald stories
 
of human folly, each one a mirror, and when I see myself
in bus windows or store glass, the shock never wears off,

because the minutes are racing by at the speed of light,

    flower of delirious retribution. You never saw such a bird,
such a triage of blood and feathers, tongue and bone. O the world
    is a sad address, bitterness melting the tongues of babies,
breasts full of accidental milk, but I can teach the flowers to grow,
    take their tight buds, unfurl them like flags in the morning heat,
fat banners of scent, flat platters of riot on the emerald scene.
    I am the green god of pine trees, conducting the music
of rustling needles through a harp of wind. I am the heart of men,
    the wild bird that drives their sex, forges their engines,
jimmies their shattered locks in the dark flare where midnight slinks.
    I am the careless minx in the skirts of women, the bright moon
caressing their hair, the sharp words pouring from their beautiful mouths
    in board rooms, on bar stools, in big city laundrettes. I am
Lester Young’s sidewinding sax, sending that Pony Express
    message out west in the Marconi tube hidden in every torso
tied tight in the corset of do and don’t, high and low, yes and no. I am

the news, the blues, the death counts, the mothers wailing
    when everyone’s gone home. I am sweeping
through the Eustachian tubes of the great plains, transmitting
    through every ear of corn, shimmying down the spine
of every Bible-thumping banker and bureaucrat, relaying the anointed
    word of the shimmering world. Every dirty foot that walks
the broken streets moves on my wings. I speak from the golden
    screens. Hear the roar of my discord murdering the trees,
screaming its furious rag, the fuselage of my revival-tent brag. Open
    your windows, slip on your castanets. I am the flamenco

Warm dark place,
Straining to break out, clawing at strange cables
Hearing her screams, laughing
“Later we forgave ourselves, we didn’t know”
Some secret jazz
Shouted, wait, don’t go.
Impatient, we came running, innocent
Laughing blobs of blood & faith.
To this mother, father world
Where laughter seems out of place
So we learned to cry, pleased
They pronounce human.
The secret Jazz blew a sigh
Some familiar sound shouted wait
 Some are evil, some will hate.
 “Just Jazz, blowing its top again”
So we rushed & laughed.
As we pushed & grabbed
While jazz blew in the night
Suddenly they were too busy to hear a simple sound
They were busy shoving mud in men’s mouths,
Who were busy dying on the living ground
Busy earning medals, for killing children on deserted street corners
Occupying their fathers, raping their mothers, busy humans we
Busy burning Japanese in atomicolorcinemascope
With stereophonic screams,
What one hundred per cent red blooded savage, would waste precious
            time
Listening to jazz, with so many important things going on
But even the fittest murderers must rest
So they sat down in our blood soaked garments,
and listened to jazz
            lost, steeped in all our death dreams
They were shocked at the sound of life, long gone from our own
They were indignant at the whistling, thinking, singing, beating,
            swinging,
They wept for it, hugged, kissed it, loved it, joined it, we drank it,
Smoked it, ate with it, slept with it
They made our girls wear it for lovemaking
Instead of silly lace gowns,
Now in those terrible moments, when the dark memories come
The secret moments to which we admit no one
When guiltily we crawl back in time, reaching away from ourselves
They hear a familiar sound,
Jazz, scratching, digging, blueing, swinging jazz,
And listen,
And feel, & die."

Inside another house, a little girl in a pretty dress

   like schizophrenia, of a brain that grew
            too fast for its own good
and that history is a series of conspiracies
 
by accidental despots. Mrs. Bradford is
            falling asleep on the wide window ledge,
   her blue polyester pants gapped
            to reveal her white socks
and pink spotted shins. We try not to look.
 
The Mad Hatter doesn’t say that the alphabet
            was first used to keep track of property
   or that for centuries people believed
            if women learned to write
the lost world would never be recovered
 
or that the Mayans believed
            outsiders wrote things down
   not in order to remember them
            but to free themselves
into the work of forgetting.
 
That year Mrs. Bradford taught us about
            the Lewis & Clark expedition
   over and over again. We never learned
            why it mattered so much to her
or what possible use it could be to anyone.
 
The professor tells Judy about
            the thousands of words
   Arabs needed for camels and their parts,
            the dozen words Eskimos had for snow,
and a chimp who learned seven human words.
 
A voice made visible says:
            magic is a matter of fact to you,
    Every miracle has to have its qualifications,
             reservations, footnotes
and our heads rise from our desks.
 
The rest of the year will be a series of
            substitute teachers
   who teach us nothing but footnotes
            and their own reservations.
Mrs. Bradford dead of a brain tumor.
 
We sit in our sixth-grade desks with the blinds
            closed against the tree-lined streets
   as the letters of the world rise up
            and, forming a single word,
eclipse our world and fill our mouths with shadows."
790,“Altar (#3)” from “Broken Chord Sequence”,Marilyn Chin,"Why cry over dried flowers?
They’re meant to be straw.
Why cry over miniature roses?
They’re meant to be small.
 
Why cry over Buddha’s hand citron?
Why cry over the hidden flower?
Why cry over Mother’s burnt forehead?
Her votive deathglow, her finest hour."
791,The American on His First Honeymoon,Rita Mae Reese,"What we can say has already been said
about each painting in the gallery—
about the quality of light, the way she holds her head.
 
So we are silent in the subway, silent in bed.
Our bodies too are mute; we fall asleep knowing
what we could say has already been said.
 
Over toast and coffee and the newspaper thoroughly read
the day unfolds between us. I am too weak to carry
this quality of light, the way she holds her head.
 
I would vow to leave if love had left
if this were the wedding of two gypsies.
But what should I say? It has been said
 
the dead would properly bury the dead
and here I am, alive at last and buried
by the quality of light, and the way she holds her head.
 
Perhaps women, sex, love are all over-rated.
Which of us is the artist and which the light? You see,
the words I might say have been better said—
words concerning the quality of light, the way you hold your head."
792,Chinese Quatrains (The Woman in Tomb 44),Marilyn Chin,"The aeroplane is shaped like a bird
Or a giant mechanical penis
My father escorts my mother
From girlhood to unhappiness
 

A dragonfly has iridescent wings
Shorn, it’s a lowly pismire
Plucked of arms and legs
A throbbing red pepperpod

 
Baby, she’s a girl
Pinkly propped as a doll
Baby, she’s a pearl
An ulcer in the oyster of God

 
Cry little baby clam cry
The steam has opened your eyes
Your secret darkly hidden
The razor is sharpening the knife
 

Abandoned taro-leaf boat
Its lonely black sail broken
The corpses are fat and bejeweled
The hull is thoroughly rotten

 
The worm has entered the ear
And out the nose of my father
Cleaned the pelvis of my mother
And ringed around her fingerbone
 

One child beats a bedpan
One beats a fishhook out of wire
One beats his half sister on the head
Oh, teach us to fish and love
 

Don’t say her boudoir is too narrow
She could sleep but in one cold bed
Don’t say you own many horses
We escaped on her skinny mare’s back

 
Man is good said Meng-Tzu
We must cultivate their natures
Man is evil said Hsun-Tzu
There’s a worm in the human heart

 
He gleaned a beaded purse from Hong Kong
He procured an oval fan from Taiwan
She married him for a green card
He abandoned her for a blonde
 

My grandmother is calling her goslings
My mother is summoning her hens
The sun has vanished into the ocean
The moon has drowned in the fen

 
Discs of jade for her eyelids
A lozenge of pearl for her throat
Lapis and kudzu in her nostrils
They will rob her again and again"
793,Dear Reader,Rita Mae Reese,"You have forgotten it all.
You have forgotten your name,
where you lived, who you
loved, why.
                      I am simply
your nurse, terse and unlovely
I point to things
and remind you what they are:
chair, book, daughter, soup.
 
And when we are alone
I tell you what lies
in each direction: This way
is death, and this way, after
a longer walk, is death,
and that way is death but you
won’t see it
until it is right
in front of you.
 
              Once after
your niece had been to visit you
and I said something about
how you must love her
or she must love you
or something useless like that,
you gripped my forearm
in your terrible swift hand
and said, she is
 everything—you gave
me a shake—everything
 to me.
                And then you fell
back into the well. Deep
in the well of everything. And I
stand at the edge and call:
                  chair, book, daughter, soup."
794,Inside,Linda Hogan,"How something is made flesh
no one can say. The buffalo soup
becomes a woman
who sings every day to her horses
or summons another to her private body
saying come, touch, this is how
it begins, the path of a newly born
who, salvaged from other lives and worlds,
will grow to become a woman, a man,
with a heart that never rests,
and the gathered berries,
the wild grapes
enter the body,
human wine
which can love,
where nothing created is wasted;
the swallowed grain
takes you through the dreams
of another night,
the deer meat becomes hands
strong enough to work.
 
But I love most
the white-haired creature
eating green leaves;
the sun shines there
swallowed, showing in her face
taking in all the light,
 
and in the end
when the shadow from the ground
enters the body and remains,
in the end, you might say,
This is myself
still unknown, still a mystery."
795,Mules,Jane Springer,"When they told us Don’t speak until spoken to, we grew
ears the size of corn.
 
When they forced us to eat everything we swallowed
their hurt whole.
 
When they hit us for drawing on the wall we painted
doors that opened behind curtains.
 
For generations they lived like this. Wanting badly to
save us—not knowing how.
 
& all the while we found love in unlikely places: In
the ravaged church of our bodies & our faces,
 
refracted in their long faces."

I cashed my welfare check and felt good.
    I saw your mama crossing the bridge of magpies

    Your father was conspicuously absent.
Admit that you loved your mother,
    that you killed your father to marry your mother.
Suddenly, my terrible childhood made sense.
    Say: beauty and truth, beauty and truth,
all ye need to know on earth all ye need to know.
    Say: I was boogying down, boogying down
Victoria Peak Way and a slip-of-a-boy climbed off his ox:
    he importuned me for a kiss, a tiny one

797,Salt Hill,Jane Springer,"I was born in a Tennessee sanatorium hours after my mother’s father died & I know
how the womb becomes a salt-sea grave.
 
I was born in the last seconds of small crops & small change rained down on the
collection plate’s felt palate & I know
 
the soul’s barn debt to past generations, too.
 
Outside, ditchfuls of chicory flashed in the after-rain sun as melancholia’s purple
scent rose & its steepled fog distilled in Tennessee hills.
 
& I know I’m not supposed to be here on account of all those crazy aunts & I know
great grandma was five
 
when her Cherokee mother died & her daddy dumped her on the red clay curb
of an Arkansas reservation then drove away in a wagon—
 
how she just strode the fields of milkweed back to Tennessee & married her cousin.
 
When I was five I drowned a fly in a piepan of water then spooned it out & heaped
a hill of salt on its still body until I could hear a buzz again (as if within a belly)
 
& I know the rush of the resurrected.
 
I was born in the last decade of small town girls wearing white gloves to funerals.
 
As an infant my boy quit suckling long enough to wave to my mother’s ghost—
who used to drift in the doorway of the hours.
 
& at three he told me at my age he had red hair & broke his neck falling off
a runaway horse—I know
 
                                            the rocking chair’s set too close to the edge of the porch."
798,The Way In,Linda Hogan,"Sometimes the way to milk and honey is through the body.
Sometimes the way in is a song.
But there are three ways in the world: dangerous, wounding,
and beauty.
To enter stone, be water.
To rise through hard earth, be plant
desiring sunlight, believing in water.
To enter fire, be dry.
To enter life, be food."
799,A Brief History of My Life Part VII,Leigh Stein,"I can’t go to the east village anymore
because it is like going on a tour

of my worst dates. I get older, my heart
leaps at the sight of children

who don’t belong to me, I pronounce
everything like an Italian opera title.

I used to listen to songs and have someone
in mind for the you parts, now I just want

to be where the light is intense, I want
the kind of heat that kills you

if you drive into it unprepared. This
isn’t a metaphor for anything else.

When I speak of the light, I mean the light.
I go to church and sing along and feel

just as moved as if my faith were blind.
When I speak of the blind, I mean

the light. Truly the only things Lindsay Lohan and I
have in common are our preoccupations

with fame and weight loss, and yet I recognize
a kinship there, as if those two things mattered

more than anything. When I speak of
the darkness, I mean this living.

In a restaurant called Caracas,
I once spent fifteen minutes arguing

about an Ayn Rand book because
every time he said Anthem I thought

he meant We the Living and I said
what dystopia, what about the woman,

and he said what about the Home
of the Infants and I said what

Home of the Infants? What about
loving a man so much you’ll sleep

with another man in order to finance
the first man’s tuberculosis treatment?

Welcome to Russia, I said, and we
were looking at each other and then

not. I tried to picture Caracas, tried
to leave him for elsewhere, a fever."
800,Immortality,Leigh Stein,"At the gym, they told me I would not die,
I would only get sexier, and I believed them.

I spent my nights wondering if this was going to turn
into something long-term, if this was what is meant by casual,

or if this was just my annual catastrophic disappointment
because if it wasn’t, then I would have to brace

myself. I took my medication and looked at pictures
of people who were not in love with me. I deleted

their names from my cache, said hello to my cat
over the phone, took more medication. Days

passed. I learned it’s hard to measure your own increasing
sexiness. I enlisted bystanders. I passed mirrors

and pretended they were not mirrors, but clean
windows, and I was not myself, I was

a clean stranger. Some days I was sure
she wanted to come home with me, and

I had to let her down easy, through the window,
like a priest. Once I’d been unleashed

from thoughts of my own death I was free
to be loved in the way I always knew I’d deserved:

reciprocally, in Fiji, our bodies lithe and bronzed
like gods, but at the same time I felt like a vampire,

and none of my friends could relate. They were jealous
of my book deal, my time spent at the ashram

while they were here, suffering another winter,
their unsexiness a flourescent sign that blinks all night."
801,Marooned,Leigh Stein,"Mother, I have been devastated all my life. I never said anything. 
That’s why I wear a parachute. Why I tiptoed from my bedroom
to yours, and lay my head on the beige carpet for fear of worse.
Were there sirens? There were. Were there familiar songs? Yes.
I am afraid of the beds I have been in. In the morning there was
the heel of your boot sharper than before. Mother, what do I do
with your mail? Do you want to keep this snake in the basement?
What about the kitten? Do you want all these photographs of other
people’s children? The temperature in the lizard’s cage is dropping.
Let’s be realistic. If I open the windows the birds will come in and
eat out the eyes. Mother, I am bereft. Mother, I wear your necklace
and nothing else. Mother, I never. Nevermind. Let’s be fatalistic.
The neighbors know I’m down here. I can hear them watching.
Mother, after they take your eyes I will sew the lids myself."
802,Zelda,Leigh Stein,"I want Rattawut Lapcharoensap to write my biography.
I want him to come to my apartment when my boyfriend’s

not home. I want to make him coffee. I know that he
will want to tape record all of our sessions, and

after I die I want these tapes catalogued and archived
in the temperature controlled basement of an ivy league

university library. Additionally, I would like
my biography to have a neon purple dust jacket and

I would like Nancy Milford to grant us permission
to call the book Zelda even though there is already

a book called Zelda because it is about the life of Zelda
Fitzgerald. Maybe because it is just one word and

that word is a name we won’t need permission; I’m
not a lawyer. Also: I would like Martin Scorsese to direct

the movie based on the book based on my real life.
I don’t know if any of you have seen The Departed yet, but

I just saw it last night and my life is almost exactly like that
except instead of Boston I grew up in Chicago, and instead

of going to police academy I toured with Cirque du Soleil.
If Rattawut could just get a hold of a copy of the screenplay

and make Matt Damon a female trapeze artist
who was born to Prussian immigrant parents in 1984,

I’m sure he’d have a good three, four chapters right there, easy.
Have any of you ever tried to think of all the different ways

you could disappoint your parents and then done them?
I chose the calliope over the violin; I ran with gypsies;

I dated a boy three years younger than me just because
he had an apartment and I didn’t want to live

with my parents anymore. I want Rattawut to tell me
he likes my blue sweater. Maybe I’ll sit next to him

while I show him old photographs and wait to see
if he puts his hand on my leg. I don’t know what will happen

to me after I turn 23, but when my biography comes out
I will have to avoid the reviews and the interviews

and any website that gives away the ending.
I will probably have to spend a few weeks in a cabin

in Minnesota. By then, I will have broken up 
with my boyfriend in order to marry Rattawut

beneath a chuppah in the western suburbs of Chicago
because even though I’m not technically Jewish,

my father is, and any tradition is better than none.
When Rattawut gives me my autographed copy,

I’ll stay inside my childhood, making daisy chains,
enrolled in summer programs for the gifted and talented.

I’ll concentrate on the photos of myself holding prize ribbons,
playing leapfrog, dressed up like Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

I won’t read the chapters about my future addiction
to pain medication, my lepidopterophobia,

my failed marriages, my miscarriages, the fire
that will destroy all my manuscripts, my fall

down the stairs. I won’t ever read the last chapter, 
the one that describes in vivid detail the flames

that will erupt from my fatal motorcycle accident
somewhere in the Badlands, how it will take weeks

for them to discover my body. I am only 22 years old. 
I want to fake my death on Facebook. I want a pony."
803,"Believe, Believe",Bob Kaufman,"Believe in this. Young apple seeds,
In blue skies, radiating young breast,
Not in blue-suited insects,
Infesting society’s garments.
 
Believe in the swinging sounds of jazz,
Tearing the night into intricate shreds,
Putting it back together again,
In cool logical patterns,
Not in the sick controllers,
Who created only the Bomb.
 
Let the voices of dead poets
Ring louder in your ears
Than the screechings mouthed
In mildewed editorials.
Listen to the music of centuries,
Rising above the mushroom time."
804,Book X,John Koethe,"In the last book of 
The Republic
 Plato turns to poetry, implicitly contrasts it with philosophy, and argues that it shouldn’t even exist in the ideal city he’s meticulously constructed. His reasoning is liable to strike us now as quaint: poets traffic in appearances, not essences, and write of things they don’t know anything about, like military strategy and battles; they portray heroic figures in the grip of powerful, deranged emotions, to which their readers must inevitably succumb; and there’s a metaphysical complaint: all art, including poetry, is essentially mimetic, and representations are inherently inferior to what they represent. You need to make some changes if you want to know what’s going on. Poetry for Plato wasn’t what you’d probably think of if you’re reading this, a marginalized enactment of experience and subjectivity in which the medium itself is half the point. Nor was philosophy the systematic study of the possibility of meaning we’ve become accustomed to, but sought instead to penetrate the veil of appearances, arriving at a vision of the good that shows us how we ought to try to live. It’s been suggested that to understand him, think of movies and TV instead of poetry, for they’re what occupy the space that poetry occupied in Athens. I agree, but then the question ultimately becomes: Should how we try to live be based on fantasies and feelings, or known facts and reason? And the suspicion that the latter aren’t much fun shows just how troubling the question really is.

 Yet even in their late, attenuated forms philosophy and poetry pose a problem, Plato’s problem. 
Write what you know
: an admonition that concedes the point that poets usually don’t. And what exactly 
does
 one know, in the intended sense? I guess what’s meant is something like a lived identity within a social world, and yet behind those limited identities lies something larger, something commonplace and ordinary, but at the same time utterly unique. Like the hedgehog, each of us knows just one big thing, a thing philosophy can’t capture and that poetry can at best remind us of or intimate, but can’t describe. As it extends itself in time the individual life remains a captive of its point of view, confined to what it knows, cut off from all those others that resemble it in all respects but one. It’s what I know and everything I know, it’s something that I know so thoroughly I can’t imagine or describe it, though it fills my eyes. But there’s no need for imagery or words: you know it too, for it lies floating in 
your 
eyes. Would Plato even recognize a poetry of consciousness? And what of consciousness itself? It’s sometimes said to have a history, a recent one, and to have been unknown to Homer’s Greeks. But that’s a fallacy, inferring how you feel from what you write; moreover, Bernard Williams showed that what they wrote shows that they felt like us. And yet the poems of the articulated consciousness lay in the blank, unwritten future, poised to spring from Hamlet’s mind, not Oedipus’s; and their challenge to Book X was still to be imagined, still to come. 

“There’s the part where you say it, and the part where you take it back” (J.L. Austin). I say these things because I want to, and sometimes even think they’re true; but now I want to take them back. Knowledge is factive, meaning one can’t know what isn’t true, and truth is simply correspondence with the facts. What are the facts of consciousness? They’re all analogies and metaphors, a feeling of existence but without reality’s defining contours, like a sense of something hesitating on the brink of being said, or hiding in the shadows of an inner room. They’re all appearances, but appearances of 
what
? Something that wanders up your limbs and nerves and blossoms in your brain? They’re all just figments of perspective, of a point of view from which the time is always 
now
, the place is always 
here
, and the thought of something hiding underneath the surface a seductive spell. The harder I try to pin them down the more elusive they become, as gradually the shadows disappear, the words turn into syllables, the face becomes anonymous and leaves me staring at a silver sheet of glass. What starts out as self-scrutiny becomes a study in self-pity, and instead of something tangible and true one winds up chasing the chimeras of Book X: the fruitless quarrel between philosophy and poetry, reason and unreason, and that tedious myth about the soul, of what becomes of it at death, then of its journey and rebirth. I’m tired, I’m far from home, I’m waiting in a chamber in a castle on a mountaintop in Umbria (poets get to do this), seven hundred miles from Athens as the crow flies, where perhaps “the sun still shines upon the hills and has not yet set.” I write the way I do because I want it to exist, but then the spell breaks and it dries up like a dream, leaving me with just this smooth, unvariegated surface, which remains.

“His words made us ashamed, and we checked our tears. He walked around, and when he said his legs were heavy he lay on his back as he had been told to do, and the man who had given him the poison touched his body, and after a while tested his feet and legs, pressed hard upon his foot and asked him if he felt this, and Socrates said no. Then he pressed his calves, and made his way up his body and showed us that it was cold and stiff. He felt it himself and said that when the cold reached his heart he would be gone. As his belly was getting cold Socrates uncovered his head—he had covered it—and said—these were his last words—‘Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius; make this offering to him and do not forget.’—‘It shall be done,’ said Crito, ‘tell us if there is anything else.’ But there was no answer. Shortly afterwards Socrates made a movement; the man uncovered him and his eyes were fixed. Seeing this Crito closed his mouth and his eyes.”"
805,Buried,Patricia Smith,"“We do not dig graves or put caskets into graves any longer. The decision was made and funeral homes were notified that families and funeral homes would have to supply grave-digging personnel.”

There’s nothing but mud. The ground looks dry and firm,
but underneath is a stew of storm. Stout shovels, rusted,
grow gummed and heavy with what I heft and rearrange.
 
Progress is slow.
 
The sun so often steams me shut, and I have to stop
to gulp sugared bites of tea,
flick away sweat with my swollen fingers,
swat hard at sluggish flies who hover,
 
like they know.
 
And when I start again, there’s a rhythm to it,
some ticking jazz that gets my square hips involved.
I craft a chant purely for downbeat:
 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss it.
 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss it.
My untried muscles blaze,
joints click,
pulse clutches my chest.
 
Whole clocks later, I pause to relish the feat,
to marvel at the way I’ve compromised the earth,
how I’ve been that kind of God for a minute.
But only time has moved.
It’s like trying to reach the next world with a spoon.
 
My boy would have laughed.
 Daddy, you better sit down and watch some ball game,
and we’d settle, Sunday lazy,
his squirm balanced on my belly.
 
He needed what I was and what I wasn’t.
Giggling in little language, he lobbed me the ball soft,
walked slower when I was at his side,
shared puffed white bread and purple jelly.
He waited patiently for me after dark
while I shuffled piles of books, looking for
a bedtime drama of spacemen or soldiers,
some crayoned splash to wrap his day around.
 
But every night, when I opened the door to his room,
all I saw
was a quivering mountain of Snoopys, Blues, and Scoobys.
Underneath them, his happy body could barely cage breath.
Giggles unleashed his toes. My line, then: Where are yoooou?

 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss it.
 
 Plunge.   Push.   Lift.   Toss—
 
With the dirt balanced high, screaming my shoulder,
I think hard on those nights of tussle and squeal.
I want to feel his heat and twist in my arms again.
 
I have to dig."
806,By the Same Author,James Longenbach,"Today, no matter if it rains,
It’s time to follow the path into the forest.

The same people will be walking the same dogs,
Or if not the same dogs, dogs that behave in similar fashions,
Some barking, some standing aloof.
The owners carry plastic bags.

But this is the forest, they complain, we must do as we like.
We must let the dogs run free,
We must follow their example,
The way we did when we were young.

Back then we slept, watched TV—
We were the dogs.
By the time the screen door slammed, we were gone.

Nobody really talks like that in the forest.
They’re proud of their dogs,
Proud especially of the ones who never bark.
They’re upset about the Norway maple, it’s everywhere,
Crowding out the hickories and oaks.

Did you know it takes a million seeds to make one tree?
Your chances of surviving in the forest,
Of replicating yourself, are slim. 

Today, the smaller dogs are wearing raincoats,
The bigger ones are stiffing it out.
They’re tense, preoccupied,
Running in circles,
Getting tangled in the leash—

It’s hard remaining human in the forest.
To move the limbs of the body,
To speak intelligible words,
These things promise change."
807,The Change,Allison Adelle Hedge Coke,"Thirteen years ago,    before bulk barns    and
fifth gear diesel tractors,    we rode royal blue tractors with
toolboxes big enough    to hold a six pack on ice.
In the one hundred fifteen degree    summer
heat    with air    so thick with moisture
you drink as you breathe.
Before the year dusters sprayed
malathion over our clustered bodies,    perspiring
while we primed bottom lugs,
those ground level leaves of tobacco,
and it clung to us with black tar so sticky we rolled
eight-inch balls off our arms at night    and
Cloroxed our clothes for hours and hours.
Before we were poisoned    and
the hospital thought we had been burned in fires,
at least to the third degree,
when the raw, oozing hives that
covered ninety-eight percent of our bodies
from the sprays ordered by the FDA
and spread by     landowners,
before anyone had seen
automated machines that top and prime.
While we topped the lavender
blooms of many tiny flowers
gathered into one,    gorgeous.
By grasping hold below the petals
with our bare, calloused hands
and twisting downward, quick, hard,
only one time,    snapped them off.
Before edgers and herbicides took
what they    call weeds,
when we walked for days
through thirty acres    and
chopped them out with hoes.
Hoes,    made long before    from wood and steel
and sometimes (even longer ago)
from wood and deer scapula.
Before the bulk primers came
and we primed all the leaves by hand,
stooped over at the waist for the
lower ones    and    through the season
gradually    rising higher     until    we stood
and worked simultaneously,
as married to the fields as we were to each other,
carrying up to fifty pounds of fresh
leaves under each arm    and    sewing them onto
sticks four feet long on a looper
under the shade of a tin-roofed barn,    made of shingle,
and poking it up through the rafters inside
to be caught by a hanger    who
poked it up higher in the rafters    to another
who held a higher position
and    so    they filled the barn.
And the leaves hung down
like butterfly wings,    though
sometimes the color of
luna moths,    or Carolina parakeets,    when just
an hour ago    they had been
laid upon    the old wooden
cart trailers pulled behind
the orange Allis-Chalmers tractor
with huge, round fenders and only
a screwdriver and salt in the toolbox,
picked by primers    so hot
we would race through the rows
to reach the twenty-five gallon
jugs of water placed throughout
the field to encourage    and    in attempt to
satisfy our insatiable thirsts
from drinking air    which poured
through our pores without breaking
through to our need    for more
water    in the sun.
Sun we imagined to disappear
yet respected    for growing all things on earth
when quenched with rains called forth
by our song     and drumming.
Leaves, which weeks later,    would be
taken down and the strings pulled
like string on top of a large dog-food bag
and sheeted up into burlap sheets
that bundled over a hundred pounds
when we smashed down with our feet,
but gently smashing,
then thrown up high    to
a catcher    on a big clapboard trailer
pulled behind two-ton trucks and
taken to market in Fuquay-Varina
and sold to Philip Morris    and
Winston-Salem    for around    a buck a pound.
Leaves cured to a bright leaf,
a golden yellow with the strongest
aroma of tobacco barn curing
and hand grown quality
before the encroachment of
big business in the Reagan era
and the slow murder of method
from a hundred years before.
When the loons cried out in
laughter by the springs and
the bass popped the surface on
the pond, early on, next to
the fields, before that time
when it was unfashionable to
transplant each individual baby plant,
the infant tobacco we nurtured, to
transplant those seedlings to each hill
in the field, the space for that particular plant
and we watched    as    they would grow.
Before all of this new age, new way,
I was a sharecropper in Willow Springs, North Carolina,
as were you    and we were proud to be Tsa la gi
wishing for winter    so we could make camp
at Qualla Boundary    and Oconaluftee
would be free of tourists and filled with snow
and those of us who held out forever
and had no CIBs would be home again
with our people, while the BIA forgot to watch.
When we still remembered before even the Europeans,
working now shoulder to shoulder with descendants
of their slaves they brought from Africa
when they sold our ancestors as slaves in the Middle East,
that then the tobacco was sacred to all of us and we
prayed whenever we smoked and
did not smoke for pleasure    and
I    was content and free.
Then they came and changed things
and you left me for a fancy white girl
and I waited on the land
until you brought her back
in that brand new white Trans Am,
purchased from our crop,    you gave her
and left her waiting in a motel.
The nearest one was forty miles away,
but    near enough    for you
and    for her    and I knew    though
I never spoke a word to you
about it,    I knew and I kept it to
myself    to this day    and time    and
I never let on
until I left    on our anniversary.
I drove the pick-up
down the dirt path    by the empty fields
and rented a shack for eighty dollars,
the one with cardboard windows
and a Gillespie house floor design,
with torn and faded floral paper on walls
and linoleum so thin over rotted board
that the floor gave if you weighed over
a hundred pounds.    I did not.
And with no running water of any kind,    or bathroom.
The one at hilltop,    where I could
see out across all the fields
and hunt for meat when I wanted
and find peace.
I heard you remarried
and went into automated farming
and kept up with America.
I watched all of you    from the hill
and I waited for the lavender blooms
to return    and when it was spring
even the blooms    had turned white.
I rolled up my bedroll,    remembering before,
when the fields were like waves on a green ocean,
and turned away,    away from the change
and corruption    of big business on small farms
of traditional agricultural people,    and sharecroppers.
Away,    so that I could always    hold this concise image
of before    that    time    and it
floods    my memory."
808,Cheerios,Billy Collins,"One bright morning in a restaurant in Chicago
as I waited for my eggs and toast,
I opened the Tribune only to discover
that I was the same age as Cheerios.

Indeed, I was a few months older than Cheerios
for today, the newspaper announced,
was the seventieth birthday of Cheerios
whereas mine had occurred earlier in the year.

Already I could hear them whispering
behind my stooped and threadbare back,
Why that dude’s older than Cheerios
the way they used to say

Why that’s as old as the hills, 
only the hills are much older than Cheerios
or any American breakfast cereal,
and more noble and enduring are the hills,

I surmised as a bar of sunlight illuminated my orange juice."
809,El Poema de lo Reverso,Victor Hernández Cruz,"In which everything goes backwards
in time and motion
Palm trees shrink back into the ground
Mangos become seeds
and reappear in the eyes of Indian
women
The years go back
cement becomes wood
Panama hats are seen upon skeletons
walking the plazas
Of once again wooden benches
The past starts to happen again
I see Columbus’s three boats
going backwards on the sea
Getting smaller
Crossing the Atlantic back to the
ports of Spain    Cadiz    Dos Palos    Huelva
Where the sailors disembark
and go back to their towns
To their homes
They become adolescents again
become children                infants
they re-enter the wombs of their mothers
till they become glances
Clutching a pound of bread
through a busy plaza
that becomes the taste
of the sound of church bells
in reverberation."
810,Fado,Jane Hirshfield,"A man reaches close
and lifts a quarter 
from inside a girl’s ear,
from her hands takes a dove
she didn’t know was there.
Which amazes more,
you may wonder:
the quarter’s serrated murmur
against the thumb
or the dove’s knuckled silence?
That he found them, 
or that she never had,
or that in Portugal,
this same half-stopped moment,
it’s almost dawn, 
and a woman in a wheelchair
is singing a fado 
that puts every life in the room
on one pan of a scale, 
itself on the other, 
and the copper bowls balance."
811,From “Critical Opalescence and the Blueness of the Sky”,John De Stefano,"Shrugging shallowly down, burrowing
in beneath the heaps of plumped cork- and sallow-
brown leaf, beneath the oak and the brittle bean-

dripping locust and the still so innocent fruit 
trees—bare-boughed and newly blossoming—skinnily
shadowing the frost-seared grasses, I and my 

“now” [in this pictured perfect] four-
year-old daughter, huddled, hidden, lie
low. I remember hiding in the fort

too: bedtimes once how snug among books and the plush 
beasts we spoke the speech of angels. Now the world is huge-
ly hushed. The winter sky is hard, kiln-fired

blue. The cherry wood retouched with buds. And small,
untimely flowers like blood-drops on the snow.

 • 

Time lapsed. Time dwelt. There was nothing 
apparently to those rumors of rescue 
or reprisals. Absence only

emptied the mind. The fond heart felt
light—likewise lifted right and justly up
to praise the day as it was to high

heaven. You were a “find”: rare, rose-
lipped, hennaed, ochred, kohled, long black-
stockinged O like one of Schiele’s urewig
girls, flashing a shy semaphore—

spelling eloquently out the f-
word, tenderly revisiting its history.
Lust—like love lost—was the catalyst:
exquisitely expedient, unchanged."
812,The Grind,Ange Mlinko,"Three mini ciabattini for breakfast
where demand for persnickety bread
is small, hence its expense, hence my steadfast
recalculation of my overhead,

which soars, and as you might expect
the ciabattini stand in for my fantasy
of myself in a sea-limned prospect,
on a terrace, with a lemon tree...

Not: Assessed a fee for rent sent a day late.
Not: Fines accrued for a lost library book.
Better never lose track of the date.
Oversleep, and you’re on the hook.

It’s the margin for error: shrinking.
It’s life ground down to recurrence.
It’s fewer books read for the thinking
the hospital didn’t rebill the insurance;

the school misplaced the kids’ paperwork.
Here’s our sweet pup, a rescue
which we nonetheless paid for, and look:
he gets more grooming than I do.

When I turn my hand mill, I think of the dowager
who ground gems on ham for her guests; 
the queen who ground out two cups of flour 
on the pregnant abdomen of her husband’s mistress;

I think of a “great rock-eating bird” 
grinding out a sandy beach, 
the foam said to be particulate matter 
of minute crustaceans, each

brilliantly spooning up Aphrodite 
to Greek porticoes, and our potatoes,
and plain living which might be
shaken by infinitesimal tattoos."
813,"The Gulf, 1987",Deborah Paredez,"The day upturned, flooded with sunlight, not
a single cloud. I squint into the glare,
cautious even then of bright emptiness.
We sit under shade, Tía Lucia
showing me how white folks dine, the high life.
I am about to try my first oyster,
Tía spending her winnings from the slots
on a whole dozen, the glistening valves
wet and private as a cheek’s other side, 
broken open before us. Don’t be shy.
Take it all in at once. Flesh and sea grit,
sweet meat and brine, a taste I must acquire. 
In every split shell, the coast’s silhouette: 
bodies floating in what was once their home."
814,His Suicide,May Swenson,"He looked down at his withering body and saw a hair
near his navel, swaying.
 
And now he saw his other hairs rise up.
 
He felt a hectic current in his veins.
Looking within, he saw the bubbling of his blood.
 
He cursed his fever, saying:
“It is the chemistry of prayer.
It increases in frequency,
seeding panic to all my being.
My cells swell with the liquid of guilt they fabricate,
juices of hatred eat my belly
my corpuscles make war in me as they devour each other.
My head heats in the combustion of anxiety,
I am polluted by the secretions of my soul’s decay,
while my brain wears away
with the scratching night and day
on the encephalograph of prayer.
I grow monstrous with the leukemia of the world.”
 
And he heard the hair say: “Hear me.”
And he saw it grow gray as it waved.
All his hairs he saw whiten,
and, numberless, wilt from their erect electric listening.
He saw them topple from their roots.
“How dare you!” he cursed them.
There surged a brief resuscitation to his body.
His heart took heart and pounded twice
with the health of fear
But then the plague of prayer redoubled and overwhelmed him.
 
In his feebleness he raged, and said:
“I will tear out this evil and free it.”

With his withered hands he tore the remaining hairs
from his body and head.
With his nails he opened his breast,
and with his fist he exploded his heart,
which erupted, a black and red volcano.
 
As his brain tasted, for the first time,
the birth of his doom,
he came a rolling tide, a floating mountain of ecstasy.
“I see you! I love you!” his eyes cried,
overflowing with his bright blood.
“You were the light of the world
that are now my gushing tears—
the kind and fiery tears of chaos, that wash my eyes
with the cure of oblivion.”
 
“He hears us!” cried his sick blood
pouring from his ears.
“Even as of old he heard our hair before it perished.”
 
With his last strength, the chemistry of prayer,
a few drops of his blood coagulated.
That clot whirled out, free, in the vortex of the universe."
815,The History of Red,Linda Hogan,"First
there was some other order of things
never spoken
but in dreams of darkest creation.
 
Then there was black earth,
lake, the face of light on water.
Then the thick forest all around
that light,
and then the human clay
whose blood we still carry
rose up in us
who remember caves with red bison
painted in their own blood,
after their kind.
 
A wildness
swam inside our mothers,
desire through closed eyes,
a new child
wearing the red, wet mask of birth,
delivered into this land
already wounded,
stolen and burned
beyond reckoning.
 
Red is this yielding land
turned inside out
by a country of hunters
with iron, flint and fire.
Red is the fear
that turns a knife back
against men, holds it at their throats,
and they cannot see the claw on the handle,
the animal hand
that haunts them
from some place inside their blood.
 
So that is hunting, birth,
and one kind of death.
Then there was medicine, the healing of wounds.
Red was the infinite fruit
of stolen bodies.
The doctors wanted to know
what invented disease
how wounds healed
from inside themselves
how life stands up in skin,
if not by magic.
 
They divined the red shadows of leeches
that swam in white bowls of water:
they believed stars
in the cup of sky.
They cut the wall of skin
to let
what was bad escape
but they were reading the story of fire
gone out
and that was a science.
 
As for the animal hand on death’s knife,
knives have as many sides
as the red father of war
who signs his name
in the blood of other men.
 
And red was the soldier
who crawled
through a ditch
of human blood in order to live.
It was the canal of his deliverance.
It is his son who lives near me.
Red is the thunder in our ears
when we meet.
Love, like creation,
is some other order of things.
 
Red is the share of fire
I have stolen
from root, hoof, fallen fruit.
And this was hunger.
 
Red is the human house
I come back to at night
swimming inside the cave of skin
that remembers bison.
In that round nation
of blood
we are all burning,
red, inseparable fires
the living have crawled
and climbed through
in order to live
so nothing will be left
for death at the end.
 
This life in the fire, I love it.
I want it,
this life."
816,Katrina,Patricia Smith,"I was birthed restless and elsewhere
 
gut dragging and bulging with ball lightning, slush,
broke through with branches, steel
 
I was bitch-monikered, hipped, I hefted
a whip rain, a swirling sheet of grit.
 
Scraping toward the first of you, hungering for wood, walls,
unturned skin. With shifting and frantic mouth, I loudly loved
the slow bones
 
of elders, fools, and willows."
817,La Lupe,Victor Hernández Cruz,"Her voice comes out of her knees,
her fingernails are full of sound,
Birds are in her lungs,
which gives her gargantuan flight,
A florescence through ether waves,
like ancestral Morse codes.
 
Oriente province de Cuba
her first steps.
At nineteen she dismantled retinas—
roosters blew themselves inside out,
When she swayed by cathedrals they folded,
guayacan trees fell to their knees,
Mountains bowed with the contents
for ajiaco.
She filled the horizon with kerchiefs,
gypsies danced behind her,
Her bracelets were snakes,
forces were captured in her gold chains,
The moon was in her silver,
there were reptiles stationed
In her Afro-Siboney cheeks,
there were in her Asian eyes
Radars picking up the fingertips
of the piano player—
The language of the trumpet—
black changos landing upon
The shelf of her eyelids.
 
She motioned in songs to live them.
Her passion destroyed the container,
She blew up into false promises,
romantic lyrics tied her in knots,
Broken into pieces of kisses,
she knew it was “theater”
That you offered,
A landscape hanging in the
museums of desire,
Rows of guayava paste,
stories that according
To your point of view,
salons of dried roses.
Illusions.
 
Her songs became the windows
of the city,
In the distance a hurt bellows
from a bird locked in a radio.
 
Classroom teacher of tropical children,
reading to them native flora—
A wind entered her and she flew to
New York,
eating the skyline,
Bridges of electric lights,
conduits to the house of the Saints.
At the Jefferson Theater
she melted the microphone
Into liquid mercury,
and an ambulance had to
Get her off the stage.
 
She embodied in gowns, capes,
dresses, necklaces, bonnets,
Velvets, suedes, diamond-studded,
flowers, sequins,
All through which
she wanted to eat herself
She salvaged us all,
but took the radiation.
Each time she sang
she crossed the sea.
From the Bronx
she went back to Cuba,
Adrift on the sails
of a song."
818,Like the Small Hole by the Path-Side Something Lives in,Jane Hirshfield,"Like the small hole by the path-side something lives in,
in me are lives I do not know the names of,

nor the fates of,
nor the hungers of or what they eat.

They eat of me.
Of small and blemished apples in low fields of me 
whose rocky streams and droughts I do not drink.

And in my streets—the narrow ones, 
unlabeled on the self-map—
they follow stairs down music ears can’t follow,

and in my tongue borrowed by darkness,
in hours uncounted by the self-clock,
they speak in restless syllables of other losses, other loves. 

There too have been the hard extinctions, 
missing birds once feasted on and feasting.

There too must be machines 
like loud ideas with tungsten bits that grind the day.

A few escape. A mercy.

They leave behind 
small holes that something unweighed by the self-scale lives in."
819,Like Two Negative Numbers Multiplied by Rain,Jane Hirshfield,"Lie down, you are horizontal. 
Stand up, you are not.

I wanted my fate to be human.

Like a perfume 
that does not choose the direction it travels,
that cannot be straight or crooked, kept out or kept.

Yes, No, Or
—a day, a life, slips through them,
taking off the third skin, 
taking off the fourth.

And the logic of shoes becomes at last simple,
an animal question, scuffing.

Old shoes, old roads—
the questions keep being new ones.
Like two negative numbers multiplied by rain 
into oranges and olives."
820,Mount Street Gardens,Frederick Seidel,"I’m talking about Mount Street.
Jackhammers give it the staggers.
They’re tearing up dear Mount Street.
It’s got a torn-up face like Mick Jagger’s.

I mean, this is Mount Street!
Scott’s restaurant, the choicest oysters, brilliant fish;
Purdey, the great shotgun maker—the street is complete
Posh plush and (except for Marc Jacobs) so English.

Remember the old Mount Street,
The quiet that perfumed the air
Like a flowering tree and smelled sweet
As only money can smell, because after all this was Mayfair?

One used to stay at the Connaught
Till they closed it for a makeover.
One was distraught
To see the dark wood brightened and sleekness take over.

Designer grease
Will help guests slide right into the zone.
Prince Charles and his design police
Are tickled pink because it doesn’t threaten the throne.

I exaggerate for effect—
But isn’t it grand, the stink of the stank,
That no sooner had the redone hotel just about got itself perfect
Than the local council decided: new street, new sidewalk, relocate the taxi rank!

Turn away from your life—away from the noise!—
Leaving the Connaught and Carlos Place behind.
Hidden away behind those redbrick buildings across the street are serious joys:
Green grandeur on a small enough scale to soothe your mind,

And birdsong as liquid as life was before you were born.
Whenever I’m in London I stop by this delightful garden to hear
The breeze in the palatial trees blow its shepherd’s horn.
I sit on a bench in Mount Street Gardens and London is nowhere near."
821,Mountain Building,Victor Hernández Cruz,"The mountain have changed to buildings
Is this hallway the inside of a stem
That has a rattling flower for a head,
Immense tree bark with roots made out of
Mailboxes?
In the vertical village moons fly out of
Apartment windows and though what you
See is a modern city
The mountain’s guitars pluck inside
It’s agriculture taking an elevator
Through urban caves which lead to
Paths underground They say Camuy
To Hutuado
Taino subground like the IRT in
Constant motion
 
The streets take walks in your dark eyes
Seashell necklaces make music in the
Origin of silence
What are we stepping on? Pineapple
Fields frozen with snow
Concrete dirt later the rocks of the
Atlantic
The sculpture of the inner earth
Down there where you thought only worms
And unnamed crocodiles parade
Lefty stands on a corner
Analyzing every seed
Squeezing the walls as he passes
Through at the bottom of the basement
Where the boiler makes heat
The flesh arrives out of a hole
In the mountain that goes up like a
Green wall
Bodies come in making maraca sounds
An invisible map out of the flora
Bees arrive in the vicinity and sing
Chorus while woody woodpeckers make
Women out of trees and place flowers
On their heads
Waterfalls like Hurakan’s faucets
Caress the back of Yuquiyu
God to all whose tongues have the
Arawak’s echoes
 
Hallway of graffiti like the master
Cave drawings made by owls when they
Had hands
You see the fish with pyramids inside
Their stomachs
Hanging near the doorways where
San Lazaro turns the keys
Villa Manhattan
Breeze of saint juice made from
Coconuts
Slide down the stairs to your
Belly and like a hypnotized guanabana
You float down the street
And win all your hands at dominoes
 
The Moros live on the top floor eating
Roots and have a rooster on the roof
Africans import okra from the bodega
The Indians make a base of guava
On the first floor
The building is spinning itself into
a spiral of salsa
Heaven must be calling or the
Residents know the direction
Because there is an upward pull
If you rise too quickly from your seat
You might have to comb a spirit’s
Hair
They float over the chimneys
Arrive through the smog
Appear through the plaster of Paris
It is the same people in the windowed
Mountains."

825,Oedipal Strivings,Frederick Seidel,"A dinosaur egg opens in a lab
And out steps my paternal grandfather, Sam,
Already taller than a man,
And on his way to becoming a stomping mile-high predator, so I ran.
I never knew my mother’s father, who may have been a suicide.
He was buried in a pauper’s grave my mother tried
To find, without success. Jews grab
The thing they love unless it’s ham,
And hold it tightly to them lest it die—
Or like my mother try
To find the ham they couldn’t hold.
A hot ham does get cold.
Grampa, monster of malevolence,
I’m told was actually a rare old-fashioned gentleman of courtly benevolence.

At night the thing to do was drive to Pevely Dairy
And park and watch the fountain shooting up and changing colors.
The child sat in the back, finishing his ice-cream soda,
Sucking the straw in the empty glass as a noisy coda.
Sometimes on Sunday they drove to the Green Parrot.
There was the sideways-staring parrot to stare at.
The chickens running around were delicious fried, but nothing was sanitary.
B.O. was the scourge of the age—and polio—and bathroom odors.
If you didn’t wash your hands,
It contributed—as did your glands!
His father always had gas for their cars from his royal rationing cards.
The little boy went to see the king at one of the king’s coal yards.
The two of them took a trip and toured the dad’s wartime coal mine.
It was fun. It was fine.

The smell of rain about to fall,
A sudden coolness in the air,
Sweetness wider than the Mississippi at its muddy brownest.
I didn’t steal his crayon, Mrs. Marshall, honest!
It’s captain midnight...brought to you by ovaltine!
I travel backwards in a time machine
And step inside a boy who’s three feet tall.
How dare he have such curly hair!
A boy and his dog go rafting down the Mississippi River.
They have a message to deliver
To the gold-toothed king.
Sire, we have a message that we bring.
Little boy, approach the throne.
Ow! I hit my funny bone.

The British consul was paid extra because it was a hardship post.
The weather was Antarctica/equatorial extreme.
Surely summer was in error.
Winter was terror.
White snowflakes the size of dinosaur eggs
Versus humidity that walked across your face on housefly legs.
I loved both the most.
Radio made women dream
Of freedom from oppression and the daily nonsense.
Hairy tarantulas in boatloads of bananas made the lazy heat immense
In the heart. Blizzards didn’t stop my father’s big blue coal trucks so why bother.
Why bother, father?

There’s moss on my stoop, a little mildew 
In the shower but you’ve never seen my shower.

I can sleep in the barn.

Suits the earth to which it belongs."

828,The Plan,Joan Hutton Landis,"For Ann Forsythe Irwin Bourgois

Remembering Ann
Whose beauty began
At the crown of her head
And ran to the deep underneath
Of her feet—
Never aware of her own élan.
Now, half mad with pain, 
She crawls through her rooms,
Calling for doctors,
Falling,
Forgetting,
Consumed,
Trepanned.

Ever since the world began—
Star fall
Nightfall
Bomb fall
Downfall...
Read the scan:
Every woman and every man,
Once a flowered Palestine,
Falls blindly toward the Nakba—
Bald catastrophe,
Prescription—
According to the
Plan."
829,Poem for My Father,Quincy Troupe,"for Quincy T. Trouppe Sr.
  

father, it was an honor to be there, in the dugout
with you, the glory of great black men swinging their lives
as bats, at tiny white balls
burning in at unbelievable speeds, riding up & in & out
a curve breaking down wicked, like a ball falling off a table
moving away, snaking down, screwing its stitched magic
into chitlin circuit air, its comma seams spinning
toward breakdown, dipping, like a hipster
bebopping a knee-dip stride, in the charlie parker forties
wrist curling, like a swan’s neck
behind a slick black back
cupping an invisible ball of dreams
 
& you there, father, regal, as an african, obeah man
sculpted out of wood, from a sacred tree, of no name, no place, origin
thick branches branching down, into cherokee & someplace else lost
way back in africa, the sap running dry
crossing from north carolina into georgia, inside grandmother mary’s
womb, where your mother had you in the violence of that red soil
ink blotter news, gone now, into blood graves
of american blues, sponging rococo
truth long gone as dinosaurs
the agent-oranged landscape of former names
absent of african polysyllables, dry husk, consonants there
now, in their place, names, flat, as polluted rivers
& that guitar string smile always snaking across
some virulent, american, redneck’s face
scorching, like atomic heat, mushrooming over nagasaki
& hiroshima, the fever blistered shadows of it all
inked, as etchings, into sizzled concrete
but you, there, father, through it all, a yardbird solo
riffing on bat & ball glory, breaking down the fabricated myths
of white major league legends, of who was better than who
beating them at their own crap
game, with killer bats, as bud powell swung his silence into beauty
of a josh gibson home run, skittering across piano keys of bleachers
shattering all manufactured legends up there in lights
struck out white knights, on the risky edge of amazement
awe, the miraculous truth sluicing through
steeped & disguised in the blues
confluencing, like the point at the cross
when a fastball hides itself up in a slider, curve
breaking down & away in a wicked, sly grin
curved & posed as an ass-scratching uncle tom, who
like old sachel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch
before coming back with a hard, high, fast one, is slicker
sliding, & quicker than a professional hitman—
the deadliness of it all, the sudden strike
like that of the “brown bomber’s” crossing right
of sugar ray robinson’s, lightning, cobra bite
 
& you, there, father, through it all, catching rhythms
of chono pozo balls, drumming, like conga beats into your catcher’s mitt
hard & fast as “cool papa” bell jumping into bed
before the lights went out
 
of the old, negro baseball league, a promise, you were
father, a harbinger, of shock waves, soon come"
830,The President Flies Over,Patricia Smith,"Aloft between heaven and them,
  
I babble the landscape—what staunch, vicious trees,
what cluttered roads, slow cars. This is my
  
country as it was gifted me—victimless, vast.
The soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears
continually loops ditties of eagles and oil.
I can’t choose. Every moment I’m awake,
aroused instrumentals channel theme songs,
speaking
what I cannot.
  
I don’t ever have to come down.
I can stay hooked to heaven,
dictating this blandness.
My flyboys memorize flip and soar.
They’ll never swoop real enough
to resurrect that other country,
  
won’t ever get close enough to give name
to tonight’s dreams darkening the water.
  
I understand that somewhere it has rained."
831,Prologue—And Then She Owns You,Patricia Smith,"This is not morning. There is a nastiness
slowing your shoes, something you shouldn’t step in.
It’s shattered beads, stomped flowers, vomit—
such stupid beauty,
 
beauty you can stick a manicured finger
into and through, beauty that doesn’t rely
on any sentence the sun chants, it’s whiskey
swelter blown scarlet.
 
Call this something else. Last night it had a name,
a name wedged between an organ’s teeth, a name
pumping a virgin unawares, a curse word.
Wail it, regardless,
 
Weak light, bleakly triumphant, will unveil scabs,
snippets of filth music, cars on collapsed veins.
The whole of gray doubt slithers on solemn skin.
Call her New Orleans.
 
Each day she wavers, not knowing how long she
can stomach the introduction of needles,
the brash, boozed warbling of bums with neon crowns,
necklaces raining.
 
She tries on her voice, which sounds like cigarettes,
pubic sweat, brown spittle lining a sax bell
the broken heel on a drag queen’s scarlet slings.
Your kind of singing.
 
Weirdly in love, you rhumba her edges, drink
fuming concoctions, lick your lukewarm breakfast
directly from her crust. Go on, admit it.
You are addicted
 
to her brick hips, the thick swerve she elicits,
the way she kisses you, her lies wide open.
She prefers alleys, crevices, basement floors.
Hell, let her woo you.
 
This kind of romance dims the worth of soldiers,
bends and breaks the back, sips manna from muscle,
tells you Leave your life. Pack your little suitcase,
flee what is rigid
 
and duly prescribed. Let her touch that raw space
between cock and calm, the place that scripts such jazz.
Let her pen letters addressed to your asking.
You s-s-stutter.
 
 New Orleans’s, p-please. Don’t. Blue is the color
stunning your tongue. At least the city pretends
to remember to be listening.
She grins with glint tooth,
  
wiping your mind blind of the wife, the children,
the numb ritual of job and garden plot.
Gently, she leads you out into the darkness
and makes you drink rain."
832,Read These,Mary Karr,"The King saith, and his arm swept the landscape’s foliage into bloom
where he hath inscribed the secret mysteries of his love
before at last taking himself away. His head away. His
recording hand. So his worshipful subjects must imagine
themselves in his loving fulfillment, who were no more
than instruments of his creation. Pawns.
Apparati. Away, he took himself and left us
studying the smudged sky. Soft pencil lead.

Once he was not a king, only a pale boy staring down
from the high dive. The contest was seriousness
he decided, who shaped himself for genus genius
and nothing less. Among genii, whoever dies first wins.
Or so he thought. He wanted the web browsers to ping
his name in literary mention everywhere on the world wide web.

He wanted relief from his head, which acted as spider
and inner web weaver. The boy was a live thing tumbled in its thread 
and tapped and fed off, siphoned from. His head kecked back
and howling from inside the bone castle from whence he came
to hate the court he held.

He was crowned with loneliness 
and suffered for friendship, for fealty 
of the noblest sort. The invisible crown
rounded his temples tighter than any turban,
more binding than a wedding band, 
and he sat in his round tower
on the rounding earth. 
                                                     Read these, 
saith the King, and put down his pen, hearing 
himself inwardly holding forth on the dullest 
aspects of the human heart 
with the sharpest possible wit. Unreadable
as Pound on usury or Aquinas on sex.

I know the noose made an oval portrait frame for his face. 
And duct tape around the base of the Ziploc 
bag was an air-tight chamber
for the regal head—most serious relic, 
breathlessly lecturing in the hall of silence."
833,Red Beans,Victor Hernández Cruz,"Next  to white rice
it looks like coral
sitting next to snow
 
Hills of starch
border
The burnt sienna
of irony
 
Azusenas being chased by
the terra cotta feathers
of a rooster
 
There is a lava flow
through the smoking
white mounds
 
India red
spills on ivory
 
Ochre cannon balls
falling
next to blanc pebbles
 
Red beans and milk
make burgundy wine
 
Violet pouring
from the eggshell

834,Report from the Subtropics,Billy Collins,"For one thing, there’s no more snow 
to watch from an evening window, 
and no armfuls of logs to carry into the house
so cumbersome you have to touch the latch with an elbow,

and once inside, no iron stove waiting like an old woman
for her early dinner of wood.

No hexagrams of frost to study carefully
on the cold glass pages of the bathroom. 

And there’s no black sweater to pull over my head
while I wait for the coffee to brew.

Instead, I walk around in children’s clothes—
shorts and a T-shirt with the name of a band
lettered on the front, announcing me to nobody.

The sun never fails to arrive early 
and refuses to leave the party
even after I go from room to room,
turning out all the lights, and making a face.

And the birds with those long white necks?
All they do is swivel their heads 
to look at me as I walk past
as if they all knew my password 
and the name of the city where I was born."
835,Siblings,Patricia Smith,"Hurricanes, 2005
  
  
Arlene learned to dance backwards in heels that were too high.
Bret prayed for a shaggy mustache made of mud and hair.
Cindy just couldn’t keep her windy legs together.
Dennis never learned to swim.
Emily whispered her gusts into a thousand skins.
Franklin, farsighted and anxious, bumbled villages.
Gert spat her matronly name against a city’s flat face.
Harvey hurled a wailing child high.
Irene, the baby girl, threw pounding tantrums.
José liked the whip sound of slapping.
Lee just craved the whip.
Maria’s thunder skirts flew high when she danced.
Nate was mannered and practical. He stormed precisely.
Ophelia nibbled weirdly on the tips of depressions.
Philippe slept too late, flailing on a wronged ocean.
Rita was a vicious flirt. She woke Philippe with rumors.
Stan was born business, a gobbler of steel.
Tammy crooned country, getting the words all wrong.
Vince died before anyone could remember his name.
Wilma opened her maw wide, flashing rot.
  
None of them talked about Katrina.
She was their odd sister,

It melts and it is here somewhere.
We all will get there."
837,The State of New York,Frederick Seidel,"I like the part I play.
They’ve cast me as Pompeii
The day before the day.
It’s my brilliant performance as a luxury man because I act that way.
They say: Just wait, you’ll see, you’ll pay,
Pompeii.

You’re a miracle in a whirlpool
In your blind date’s vagina
At your age. Nothin could be fina.
You eat off her bone china.
Don’t be a ghoul. Don’t be a fool,
You fool.

In the lifelong month of May,
Racing joyously on his moto poeta to the grave,
He’s his own fabulous slave.
He rides his superbike faster and faster to save
His master from the coming lava from China, every day,
But especially today, because it’s on its way.

Fred Astaire is about to explode
In his buff-colored kidskin gloves, revolving around
The gold knob of his walking stick, with the sound
Of Vesuvia playing,
And the slopes of Vesuvia saying
Her effluvia are in nearly overflowing mode.

Freud had predicted Fred.
In The Future of an Illusion he said:
“Movies are, in other words, the future of God.”
Nothing expresses ordinary wishes more dysplastically than current
American politics do. Breast augmentation as a deterrent
To too much government is odd.

Korean women in a shop on Madison give a pedicure to Pompeii.
Fred only knows that he’s not getting old.
Pompeii doesn’t know it’s the day before the day.
The governor of New York is legally blind, a metaphor for his state of mind.
He ought to resign, but he hasn’t resigned.
Good riddance, goodbye. The bell has tolled."
838,Suicide’s Note: An Annual,Mary Karr,"I hope you’ve been taken up by Jesus
though so many decades have passed, so far apart we’d grown
     between love transmogrifying into hate and those sad letters
           and phone calls and your face vanishing into a noose that
I couldn’t 
     today name the gods
           you at the end worshipped, if any, praise being
impossible for the devoutly miserable. And screw my church who’d 
     roast in Hell poor suffering
           bastards like you, unable to bear the masks 
of their own faces. With words you sought to shape
     a world alternate to the one that dared
           inscribe itself so ruthlessly across your eyes, for you
could not, could never
     fully refute the actual or justify the sad heft of your body, earn
           your rightful space or pay for the parcels of oxygen you 
inherited. More than once you asked
     that I breathe into your lungs like the soprano in the opera
           I loved so my ghost might inhabit you and you ingest my belief 
in your otherwise-only-probable soul. I wonder does your 
     death feel like failure to everybody who ever
           loved you as if our collective cpr stopped
too soon, the defib paddles lost charge, the corpse
     punished us by never sitting up. And forgive my conviction 
           that every suicide’s an asshole. There is a good reason I am not 
God, for I would cruelly smite the self-smitten. 
     I just wanted to say ha-ha, despite
           your best efforts you are every second
alive in a hard-gnawing way for all who breathed you deeply in, 
     each set of lungs, those rosy implanted wings, pink balloons.
          We sigh you out into air and watch you rise like rain."
839,Tear,Linda Hogan,"It was the time before
I was born.
I was thin.
I was hungry. I was
only a restlessness inside a woman’s body.
 
Above us, lightning split open the sky.
Below us, wagon wheels cut land in two.
Around us were the soldiers,
young and afraid,
who did not trust us
with scissors or knives
but with needles.
 
Tear dresses they were called
because settler cotton was torn
in straight lines
like the roads we had to follow
to Oklahoma.
 
But when the cloth was torn,
it was like tears,
impossible to hold back,
and so they were called
by this other name,
for our weeping.
 
I remember the women.
Tonight they walk
out from the shadows
with black dogs,
children, the dark heavy horses,
and worn-out men.
 
They walk inside me. This blood
is a map of the road between us.
I am why they survived.
The world behind them did not close.
The world before them is still open.
All around me are my ancestors,
my unborn children.
I am the tear between them
and both sides live."
840,A Terror is More Certain . . .,Bob Kaufman,"A terror is more certain than all the rare desirable popular songs I


know, than even now when all of my myths have become . . . , & walk


around in black shiny galoshes & carry dirty laundry to & fro, & read


great books & don’t know criminals intimately, & publish fat books of


the month & have wifeys that are lousy in bed & never realize how


bad my writing is because i am poor & symbolize myself.


 


A certain desirable is more terror to me than all that’s rare. How


come they don’t give an academic award to all the movie stars that


die? they’re still acting, ain’t they? even if they are dead, it should


not be held against them, after all they still have the public on their


side, how would you like to be a dead movie star & have people sit-


ting on your grave?


 


A rare me is more certain than desirable, that’s all the terror, there


are too many basketball players in this world & too much progress


in the burial industry, lets have old fashioned funerals & stand


around & forgive & borrow wet handkerchiefs, & sneak out for


drinks & help load the guy into the wagon, & feel sad & make a


date with the widow & believe we don’t see all of the people sink-


ing into the subways going to basketball games & designing baby


sitters at Madison Square Garden.


 


A certain me is desirable, what is so rare as air in a Poem, why can’t


i write a foreign movie like all the other boys my age, I confess to all


the crimes committed during the month of April, but not to save


my own neck, which is adjustable, & telescopes into any size noose,


I’m doing it to save Gertrude Stein’s reputation, who is secretly


flying model airplanes for the underground railroad stern gang of


oz, & is the favorite in all the bouts . . . not officially opened yet


Holland tunnel is the one who writes untrue phone numbers.


 


A desirable poem is more rare than rare, & terror is certain, who


wants to be a poet & work a twenty four hour shift, they never ask


you first, who wants to listen to the radiator play string quartets all


night. I want to be allowed not to be, suppose a man wants to


swing on the kiddie swings, should people be allowed to stab him


with queer looks & drag him off to bed & its no fun on top of a


lady when her hair is full of shiny little machines & your ass


reflected in that television screen, who wants to be a poet if you


fuck on t.v. & all those cowboys watching."
841,Things keep sorting themselves.,Jane Hirshfield,"Does the butterfat know it is butterfat,
milk know it’s milk?
No.
Something just goes and something remains.

Like a boardinghouse table:
men on one side, women on the other.
Nobody planned it.

Plaid shirts next to one another,
talking in accents from the Midwest.

Nobody plans to be a ghost.

Later on, the young people sit in the kitchen.

Soon enough, they’ll be the ones 
to stumble Excuse me and quickly withdraw.
But they don’t know that.
No one can ever know that."
842,Three Songs from the 50s,Victor Hernández Cruz,"Song 1
 
Julito used to shine the soul
of his shoes before he left for
the Palladium to take the wax
off the floor while Tito Rodriguez
flew around the walls like a
parakeet choking maracas
It was around this time that
Julito threw away his cape
because the Umbrella Man and the
Dragons put the heat on all the
Ricans who used to fly around
in Dracula capes swinging canes
or carrying umbrellas
Even if there was no rain
on the horizon
That same epoca my mother
got the urge to paint the
living room pink and buy a
new mirror with flamingoes
elegantly on the right hand
corner because the one we had
was broken from the time that
Carlos tried to put some respect
Into Julito and knock the
party out of him.
 
 
 Song 2
 
All the old Chevies that the
gringoes from upstate New York
wore out
Were sailing around the neighborhood
with dices and San Martin de Porres
el negrito who turned catholic
Hanging in the front windows.
 
 
 Song 3
 
There was still no central heating
in the tenements
We thought that the cold was
the oldest thing on the planet earth
We used to think about my Uncle Listo
Who never left his hometown
We’d picture him siting around
cooling himself with a fan
In that imaginary place
called Puerto Rico."
843,Time Zones,Victor Hernández Cruz,"Time is crying upon the backs of lizards,
Through the white stone of the medieval city
They dash.
The houses that are walking up the stairs,
Flowers out of ruins,
Further into the fortress,
The sounds of a language registers
In our dreams.
 
Words which are my hat in the city,
Coming through the bamboo
The shadows of lost meaning—
Tilted light making slivers
Through the forest of the mambo
Behind the eyes.
 
Time will shine your head into skull
The circle song will come again and again,
If we forget how to lay out a village,
Just open a guayaba in half,
These seeds are perfect,
And can guide you back,
Your hands the electric of the ghosts.
 
In the Persia of shining alfombras,
A belly button silks upon a horse,
Enters a tent of rhythms,
Makes the trees dance into shape,
Rubén Darío saw them in the river,
Bathing in the echoes of the castles,
His Indio head,
Clean enough to measure
The tempo of a camel,
The first string that vibrated
The Rock of Gibraltar,
To sway Greco-Roman lips,
Arising fire of Gypsy song,
Was making Castile dress and undress,
With the sounds that were hitting the moon
And falling down unto earth as colors.
 
Of boats that were my shoes.
Atlantic chachachá.
Splicing through 101st Street brick.
Which covered dancing verdure green
Rectangular mangos,
Cylindric bananas
Sounds in the sky blue tropic: mind.
 
Trees are making maracas
That will soon make you dance.
 
Water is their god of cadence,
As I sea walk through coconut heights,
Legs of tamarind,
Purple orchids arranged like syllables,
Insects of the morning dew sting verses on café.
In embroidery of Italians,
Garcilaso came to José Martí,
Who ducked Spanish spies
In Manhattan
And hugged Walt Whitman’s beard in Philadelphia
As the Cuban Habaneras’ Shango
Made it south to tango.
 
Boats are ages sailing on water,
Parrots are flying out of castanets,
Flamenco peeling pineapples
That go up the river,
The water that became El Quijote’s language,
As a cane field disappears into a bottle,
To awake in a little town
With molasses orbiting the cathedral,
A wooden saint slicing through the
Mountain full of potassium radiation,
Slanted plátanos pointing into medieval
Liturgy,
Bongo and ocean waves carving
Phantasmal antiquity
Through the fabulous language
That has taken the shape of
An Andalusian rhyming door,
One after the other.
Perfume pagano
Sailing out of the archways,
As Ricardo Ray turns into a centipede,
Marching across a Brooklyn piano,
For dancers to Sanskrit their
Gypsy feet,
Upon Albaicín ceramic tile.
Caribbean sun melts the caramel,
Making our first national flag:
White skirts waving  in the air.
Machetes taking off like helicopters
Chopping off branches for timbale sticks,
The hands of the sun hitting the
Moon like a drum—
Making the atmosphere of moisture
Heat up,
For the chorus of the song
To come back down upon us polinizando
The carnival flower,
A serenade walkilipiando.
 
Sliding upon seashells,
That disappear into the foam of time,
One age living next to another,
We are both living things at once,
We are the cadaver that is
About to be born."
844,Two,Linda Hogan,"The weight of a man on a woman
is like falling into the river without drowning.
 
Above, the world is burning and fighting.
Lost worlds flow through others.
 
But down here beneath water’s skin,
river floor, sand, everything
 
is floating, rocking.
Water falls through our hands as we fall through it.
 
And when a woman and a man come up from water
they stand at the elemental edge of difference.
 
Mirrored on water’s skin,
they are fired clay, water evaporating into air.
 
They are where water turns away from land
and goes back to enter a larger sea.
 
A man and a woman are like those rivers,
entering a larger sea
 
greater than the sum of all its parts."

Urgent Care. That was pretty
               multivalent. As in:

846,Victory Parade,Frederick Seidel,"My girlfriend is a miracle.
She’s so young but she’s so beautiful.
So is her new bikini trim,
A waxed-to-neatness center strip of quim.

Now there’s a word you haven’t heard for a while.
It makes me smile.
It makes me think of James Joyce.
You hear his Oirish voice.

It’s spring on Broadway, and in the center strip mall
The trees are all
Excited to be beginning.
My girlfriend’s amazing waxing keeps grinning.

It’s enough to distract
From the other drastic act
Of display today—Osama bin Laden is dead!
One shot to the chest and one to the head,

SEAL Team 6 far away from my bed
Above Broadway—in Abbottabad, Pakistan, instead.
Bullets beyond compare
Flew over there,

Flew through the air
To above and below the beard of hair,
A type of ordnance that exploded
Inside the guy and instantly downloaded

The brains out the nose. Our Vietnam
Is now radical Islam.
I tip my hat and heart to the lovely tiny lampshade
Above her parade."
847,What Next,Frederick Seidel,"So the sun is shining blindingly but I can sort of see.
It’s like looking at Mandela’s moral beauty.
The dying leaves are sizzling on the trees
In a shirtsleeves summer breeze.

But daylight saving is over.
And gaveling the courtroom to order with a four-leaf clover
Is over. And it’s altogether November.
And the Pellegrino bubbles rise to the surface and dismember."
848,Wife’s Disaster Manual,Deborah Paredez,"When the forsaken city starts to burn,
after the men and children have fled,
stand still, silent as prey, and slowly turn

back. Behold the curse. Stay and mourn 
the collapsing doorways, the unbroken bread 
in the forsaken city starting to burn.

Don’t flinch. Don’t join in. 
Resist the righteous scurry and instead
stand still, silent as prey. Slowly turn

your thoughts away from escape: the iron
gates unlatched, the responsibilities shed.
When the forsaken city starts to burn,

surrender to your calling, show concern 
for those who remain. Come to a dead
standstill. Silent as prey, slowly turn

into something essential. Learn
the names of the fallen. Refuse to run ahead
when the forsaken city starts to burn.
Stand still and silent. Pray. Return."

850,Inheriting My Grandmother's Nightmare,Anne Stevenson,"Consider the adhesiveness of things 
       to the ghosts that prized them, 
the ""olden days"" of birthday spoons 
       and silver napkin rings. 
Too carelessly I opened 
       that velvet drawer of heirlooms. 
There lay my grandmother's soul 
begging under veils of tarnish to be brought back whole. 

She who was always a climate in herself, 
       who refused to vanish 
as the nineteen-hundreds grew older and louder, 
       and the wars worse, 
and her grandchildren, bigger and ruder 
       in her daughter's house. 
How completely turned around 
her lavender world became, how upside down. 

And how much, under her ""flyaway"" hair, 
       she must have suffered, 
sitting there ignored by the dinner guests 
       hour after candlelit hour, 
rubbed out, like her initials on the silverware, 
       eating little, passing bread, 
until the wine's flood, the smoke's blast, 
the thunderous guffaws at last roared her to bed. 

In her tiny garden of confidence, 
       wasted she felt, and furious. 
She fled to church, but Baby Jesus 
       had grown out of his manger. 
She read of Jews in the New Haven Register 
       gassed or buried alive. 
Every night, at the wheel of an ambulance, 
she drove and drove, not knowing how to drive. 

She died in '55, paralyzed, helpless. 
       Her no man's land survived. 
I light my own age with a spill 
       from her distress. And there it is, 
her dream, my heirloom, my drive downhill 
       at the wheel of the last bus, 
the siren's wail, the smoke, the sickly smell. 
The drawer won't shut again. It never will."
851,Self-Portrait at 38,Jennifer Tonge,"Hair still Titian,
but Botticelli's grip has loosened—

not now Rubenesque,   
and probably never;

Ingres approaches,   
but Courbet might capture me.

Could I be surreal?
It seems almost likely—

bells in my ears
and fortresses under;

cones have been set on my eyes.
My spring is gone

and summer's upon me,
rude in its ripening.

I'm espaliered, strung wide and tied,   
pinioned, and thus can I fly."
852,The New-England Boy's Song about Thanksgiving Day,Lydia Maria Child,"Over the river, and through the wood,
    To grandfather's house we go;
        The horse knows the way,
        To carry the sleigh,
    Through the white and drifted snow.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    To grandfather's house away!
        We would not stop
        For doll or top,
    For 't is Thanksgiving day.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    Oh, how the wind does blow!
        It stings the toes,
        And bites the nose,
    As over the ground we go.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    With a clear blue winter sky,
        The dogs do bark,
        And children hark,
    As we go jingling by.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    To have a first-rate play —
        Hear the bells ring
        Ting a ling ding,
    Hurra for Thanksgiving day!

Over the river, and through the wood —
    No matter for winds that blow;
        Or if we get
        The sleigh upset,
    Into a bank of snow.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    To see little John and Ann;
        We will kiss them all,
        And play snow-ball,
    And stay as long as we can.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    Trot fast, my dapple grey!
        Spring over the ground,
        Like a hunting hound,
    For 't is Thanksgiving day!

Over the river, and through the wood,
    And straight through the barn-yard gate;
        We seem to go
        Extremely slow,
    It is so hard to wait.

Over the river, and through the wood,
    Old Jowler hears our bells;
        He shakes his pow,
        With a loud bow wow,
    And thus the news he tells.

Over the river, and through the wood —
    When grandmother sees us come,
        She will say, Oh dear,
        The children are here,
    Bring a pie for every one.

Over the river, and through the wood —
    Now grandmother's cap I spy!
        Hurra for the fun!
        Is the pudding done?
    Hurra for the pumpkin pie!"
853,The Peacock at Alderton,Geoffrey Hill,"Nothing to tell why I cannot write 
in re Nobody; nobody to narrate this 
latter acknowledgement: the self that counts 
words to a line, accountable survivor 
pain-wedged, pinioned in the cleft trunk, 
less petty than a sprite, poisonous as Ariel 
to Prospero's own knowledge. In my room 
a vase of peacock feathers. I will attempt 
to describe them, as if for evidence 
on which a life depends. Except for the eyes 
they are threadbare, the threads hanging 
as from a luminate tough weed in February. 
But those eyes—like a Greek letter, 
omega, fossiled in an Indian shawl; 
like a shaved cross section of living tissue, 
the edge metallic blue, the core of jet, 
the white of the eye in fact closer to beige, 
the whole encircled with a black-fringed green. 
The peacock roosts alone on a Scots pine 
at the garden end, in blustery twilight 
his lambent cloak stark as a warlock's cape, 
the maharajah-bird that scavenges 
close by the stone-troughed, stone-terraced, stone-ensurfed 
Suffolk shoreline; at times displays his scream."
854,Book Three: 1,Srikanth Reddy,"It was a forlorn eve,
                            my descent wintry.
                                                        In that foreign midnight,
 
 
I sounded
                            the chanceries of doubt
                                                        as day drove up
 
 
in an ordinary yellow cab.
                            To my astonishment,
                                                        I seemed to be blindfolded

                                                        continuing called me,
 
 
a voice ever stranger
                            in complaint.
                                                        With my staff I came
 
 
to the first step,
                            sanguine indeed,
                                                        and dressed in a well-cut Western suit
 
 
—quite the best I saw on anybody
                            during my whole stay
                                                        in that unstable regime.
 
 
There were people in plots
                            bowing to creation.
                                                        Please I protested,
 
 
I had not come to stay,

 all will be quiet.
                            I looked down
                                                        and could see thousands
 
 
crowding into the grounds
                            —my     my—
                                                        and climbed into the burial site.
 
 
Within the twisted
                            rows of graves,
                                                        the teeth of under,
 
 
some spoke of hatred
                            and some of hope.
                                                        Blind, they wept on command,
 
 
in wheelchairs,
                            on crutches,
                                                        waving stumps.
 
 
It was rather haunting—
                            the gates of shadows,
                                                        the path unlit,
 
 
and ahead,
                            also dark,
                                                        an abandoned fortress.
 
 
Carried along by the crowd,
                            our way lit by flashlights
                                                        through dim corridors,

                                                        Ahead, a door opened.
 
 
I recognized the old council
                            sitting round a table,
                                                        some in religious collars,
 
 
the atmosphere a court.
                            Chairing the proceeding,
                                                        a tall, bearded figure
 
 
uttered a few words in German,
                            for my benefit.
                                                        He had lived for a time
 
 
and remarked
                            that I needed
                                                        to be dealt with.
 
 
Listening quietly,
                            I tried to avoid
                                                        any show of emotion.
 
 
This clearly displeased him.
                            He seemed to expect me
                                                        to present my own commentary.
 
 
I said in reply
                            the following,
                                                        shaken and uneasy,
 
 
the slim thread of truth but little help . . ."
855,Book Three: 16,Srikanth Reddy,"I tried to cut through

 is perfectly clear in the pit

                                                        to such classical concepts
 
 
as freedom and necessity,
                            laboriously continued
                                                        in the traditional way—

859,Aphrodisia,Richard Hoffman,"Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered,
sibilant similes and promises sotto voce.
It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard,
 
the form and content clash, create this weird
distortion like an echo or a tape delay.
Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered.
 
On which do you place emphasis: The words?
Or the breath? The farfetched or the foreplay?
It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard
 
when objectivity has disappeared
and your lover is getting further carried away.
Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered
 
vows? It’s hard to take him at his word,
or hers: Speak up! Proclaim! you want to say.
It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard,
 
hard to admit one sharp as you is stirred.
You need to back off, cool down, act blasé.
Love’s language is hyperbole, but whispered.
It’s easy to imagine you’ve misheard."
860,December 31st,Richard Hoffman,"All my undone actions wander
naked across the calendar,
 
a band of skinny hunter-gatherers,
blown snow scattered here and there,
 
stumbling toward a future
folded in the New Year I secure
 
with a pushpin: January’s picture
a painting from the 17th century,
 
a still life: Skull and mirror,
spilled coin purse and a flower."
861,II. The Mermaid (from The Sea Cabinet),Caitríona O'Reilly,"Between the imaginary iceberg and the skeletal whale
is the stuffed and mounted mermaid in her case,
the crudely-stitched seam between skin and scale
 
so unlike Herbert Draper’s siren dreams, loose
on the swelling tide, part virgin and part harpy.
Her post-mortem hair and her terrible face
 
look more like P.T. Barnum’s Freak of Feejee,
piscene and wordless, trapped in the net of a stare.
She has the head and shrivelled tits of a monkey,
 
the green glass eyes of a porcelain doll, a pair
of praying-mantis hands, and fishy lips
open to reveal her sea-caved mouth, her rare
 
ivory mermaid-teeth. Children breathe and rap
on the glass to make her move. In her fixity
she’s as far as can be from the selkie who slips
 
her wet pelt on the beaches of Orkney
and walks as a woman, pupils widened in light,
discarding the stuffed sack of her body.
 
Without hearing, or touch, or taste, or smell, or sight
she echoes the numb roll of the whale
in a sea congealed with cold, when it was thought
 
no beast could be as nerveless as the whale."
862,IV. The Curée (from A Quartet For the Falcon),Caitríona O'Reilly,"The secretive hart turns at bay,
lowers his tines to the hounds’ cry.
The sword enters the bull’s heart—
                        still he stands,
            amazed on the red sand
as the stony unbeliever might,
 
who has seen God. Soon now
horns will sound dedow
for the unmaking. Beaters flush
                        the grey heron
            like a coney from its warren,
the peregrine’s jet eyes flash.
 
They go ringing up the air,
each in its separate spiral stair
to the indigo rim of the skies,
                        then descend
            swift as a murderer’s hand
with a knife. Death’s gesture liquefies
 
in bringing the priestly heron down.
Her prize, the marrow from a wing-bone
in which she delights, her spurred
                        fleur-de-lys tongue
            stained gold-vermilion—
little angel in her hangman’s hood."
863,Long Enough,Richard Hoffman,"You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,
but I have lived two decades longer now than you
and all this time I have carried you in my head
 
so I think I have the right to question what you said,
dear teacher. My religious upbringing’s residue,
you would have thought it foolish. To speak to the dead,
 
however, is sometimes necessary, especially haunted
by all the things I know you hoped I’d do
with all this time that I have carried you in my head.
 
In a dream last night I followed where you led
until you asked me in a loud voice what I knew.
(You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,
 
but I was dreaming and could not refuse.) I said
that you were wrong, that I could see your bitter view
(since all this time I have carried you in my head)
 
for what it was, and you for who you were. Instead
of dreaming your reply I woke as you withdrew.
You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead
but all this time I have carried you in my head."
864,An Old Story,Richard Hoffman,"A few days after my mother died
the furnace went out, and my father,
who had been sitting in his chair
across from hers since the funeral,
 
his unshaven chin on his chest,
heaved himself up and went down
the cold gray cellar stairs to see if
he could relight the pilot himself
 
or would have to call for help.
I know what it must have been like
because I remember him other times
on his back down there, cursing
 
match after match, god damning
each for burning his fingers, as he
reached through the tiny metal door
as many times as it took. This time
 
it lit, caught, and roared back to life.
When my father sat up he faced
the washer, the dryer, the empty
laundry basket, the ironing board,
 
and my mother’s radio above the sink,
her absence so vivid that climbing
the stairs he thought he heard her
behind him, and he turned around."
865,Winter Psalm,Richard Hoffman,"Boston snowbound, Logan closed, snowplows
and salt-trucks flashing yellow, drifts
tall as a man some places, visibility poor,
I sit by the window and watch the snow
 
blow sideways north-northeast, hot cup
in hand, robe over pajamas.
You have made me to seek refuge
and charged me to care for my brothers.
 
How cruel. That could be You out there
howling, cracking the trees, burying everything.
What could I possibly want from You
that would not undo the whole world as it is?"
866,Spelt from Sibyl’s Leaves,Gerard Manley Hopkins,"Earnest, earthless, equal, attuneable, ' vaulty, voluminous, . . . stupendous
 Evening strains to be time’s vást, ' womb-of-all, home-of-all, hearse-of-all night.
 Her fond yellow hornlight wound to the west, ' her wild hollow hoarlight hung to the height
 Waste; her earliest stars, earl-stars, ' stárs principal, overbend us,
 Fíre-féaturing heaven. For earth ' her being as unbound, her dapple is at an end, as-

 With: Óur évening is over us; óur night ' whélms, whélms, ánd will end us.

 Ever so black on it. Óur tale, O óur oracle! ' Lét life, wáned, ah lét life wind

867,The Song of Wandering Aengus,William Butler Yeats,"I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And someone called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done,
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun."
868,Breakfast for Supper,Christine Stewart-Nuñez,"At IHOP, after the skinny brunette
with a band-aid covering her hickey
comes to whisk away burnt toast,
Mom mentions Theresa, face
brightening. She had a dream
about her—80s flip hair, smooth
complexion. I’ve been living
in Tulsa for eighteen years,
Theresa said. I understand.
Even as I watched men lower
her casket, I fantasized the witness
protection program had resettled her.

How funny we look, mother
and daughter laughing over
scrambled eggs, tears dripping
onto bacon, hands hugging
coffee mugs. For a moment Mom felt
Theresa there. Such faith. Freshen
your cup? the waitress asks me, poised
to pour. Cloudy in the cold coffee,
my reflection. I offer the mug."
869,Elegy with Oil in the Bilge,Patrick Phillips,"By the time we got out on the water
the sun was so low, it wasn’t like water

but a field of gray snow that we plowed
in one endless white furrow of water

as I skirted the rocks and wrecked trawlers
and abandoned old jetties just under the water,

while you moaned in the bow, slick with fever,
whispering back to whatever the water

chattered and hissed through the hull—
until at last there were lights on the water

and I let the old Mercury rattle and sputter
its steaming gray rainbows out onto the water

as we drifted, at idle, for the last time in your life,
through that beloved, indifferent harbor."
870,"Flathead Lake, October",Geraldine Connolly,"The eagle floats and glides,
circling the burnished aspen,

then takes the high pines
with a flash of underwing.

As surely as the eagle sails
toward the bay’s open curve,

as surely as he swoops and seizes
the struggling fish, pulling

it from an osprey’s beak;
so too, autumn descends,

to steal the glistening
summer from our open hands."
871,Mockingbird II,Carol V. Davis,"How perfectly he has mastered
the car alarm, jangling us from sleep.
    Later his staccato scatters smaller birds
that landed on the wire beside him.
    Perhaps the key to success
is imitation, not originality.
    Once, when the cat slinked up
the orange tree and snatched a hatchling,
    the mockingbird turned on us,
marked us for revenge.
    For two whole weeks he dive bombed
whenever I ventured out the screen door
    lured by his call: first tricked into thinking
the soft coo was a mourning dove courting,
    next drawn by the war cry of a far larger animal.
He swooped from one splintered eave, his mate from the other,
    aiming to peck out my eyes, to wrestle
the baby from my arms, to do God knows what
    with that newborn."
872,School,Daniel J. Langton,"I was sent home the first day
with a note: Danny needs a ruler.
My father nodded, nothing seemed so apt.
School is for rules, countries need rulers,
graphs need graphing, the world is straight ahead.

It had metrics one side, inches the other.
You could see where it started
and why it stopped, a foot along,
how it ruled the flighty pen,
which petered out sideways when you dreamt.

I could have learned a lot,
understood latitude, or the border with Canada,
so stern compared to the South
and its unruly river with two names.
But that first day, meandering home, I dropped it."
873,Telling Time,Jo McDougall,"My son and I walk away
from his sister’s day-old grave.
Our backs to the sun,
the forward pitch of our shadows
tells us the time.
By sweetest accident
he inclines
his shadow,
touching mine."
874,Temporary Job,Minnie Bruce Pratt,"Leaving again. If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t be
grieving. The particulars of place lodged in me,
like this room I lived in for eleven days,
how I learned the way the sun laid its palm
over the side window in the morning, heavy
light, how I’ll never be held in that hand again."
875,Writing,Judson Mitcham,"But prayer was not enough, after all, for my father.
His last two brothers died five weeks apart.
He couldn’t get to sleep, had no appetite, sat
staring. Though he prayed,
he could find no peace until he tried
to write about his brothers, tell a story
for each one: Perry’s long travail
with the steamfitters’ union, which he worked for;
and Harvey—here the handwriting changes,
he bears down—Harvey loved his children.

I discovered those few sheets of paper
as I looked through my father’s old Bible
on the morning of his funeral. The others
in the family had seen them long ago;
they had all known the story,
and they told me I had not, most probably, because
I am a writer,
and my father was embarrassed by his effort. Yet
who has seen him as I can: risen

in the middle of the night, bending over
the paper, working close
to the heart of all greatness, he is so lost."
876,from The Lost Letters of Frederick Douglass,Evie Shockley,"June 5, 1892
 
Dear Daughter,
                             Can you be fifty-three this
month? I still look for you to peek around
my door as if you’d discovered a toy
you thought gone for good, ready at my smile
to run up and press your fist into my
broken palm. But your own girls have outgrown
such games, and I cannot pilfer back time
I spent pursuing Freedom. Fair to you,
to your brothers, your mother? Hardly.
 
                                                                       But
what other choice did I have? What sham,
what shabby love could I offer you, so
long as Thomas Auld held the law over
my head? And when the personal threat was
ended, whose eyes could mine enter without
shame, if turning toward my wife and children
meant turning my back?
 
                                               Your mother’s eyes stare
out at me through yours, of late. You think I
didn’t love her, that my quick remarriage
makes a Gertrude of me, a corseted
Hamlet of you. You’re as wrong as you are
lucky. Had Anna Murray had your
education as a girl, my love for
her would have been as passionate as it
was grateful. But she died illiterate,
when I had risked my life to master language.
The pleasures of book and pen retain
the thrill of danger even now, and you
may understand why Ottilie Assing,
come into our house to translate me into
German, could command so many hours,
years, of my time—or, as you would likely
say, of your mother’s time.
 
                                                Forgive me,
Rosetta, for broaching such indelicate
subjects, but as my eldest child and
only living daughter, I want you to
feel certain that Helen became the new
Mrs. Douglass because of what we shared
in sheaves of my papers: let no one
persuade you I coveted her skin.
I am not proud of how I husbanded
your mother all those years, but marriage,
too, is a peculiar institution.
I could not have stayed so unequally yoked
so long, without a kind of Freedom in
it. Anna accepted this, and I don’t
have to tell you that her lot was better
and she, happier, than if she’d squatted
with some other man in a mutual
ignorance.
 
                 Perhaps I will post, rather
than burn, this letter, this time. I’ve written it
so often, right down to these closing lines,
in which I beg you to be kinder, much
kinder, to your step-mother. You two are
of an age to be sisters, and of like
temperament—under other circumstances,
you might have found Friendship in each other.
 
With regards to your husband—I am, as
ever, your loving father—
 
 
                                               Frederick Douglass"
877,The Golden Shovel,Terrance Hayes,"after Gwendolyn Brooks

I. 1981
 
When I am so small Da’s sock covers my arm, we
cruise at twilight until we find the place the real
 
men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.
His smile is a gold-plated incantation as we
 
drift by women on bar stools, with nothing left
in them but approachlessness. This is a school
 
I do not know yet. But the cue sticks mean we
are rubbed by light, smooth as wood, the lurk
 
of smoke thinned to song. We won’t be out late.
Standing in the middle of the street last night we
 
watched the moonlit lawns and a neighbor strike
his son in the face. A shadow knocked straight
 
Da promised to leave me everything: the shovel we
used to bury the dog, the words he loved to sing
 
his rusted pistol, his squeaky Bible, his sin.
The boy’s sneakers were light on the road. We
 
watched him run to us looking wounded and thin.
He’d been caught lying or drinking his father’s gin.
 
He’d been defending his ma, trying to be a man. We
stood in the road, and my father talked about jazz,
 
how sometimes a tune is born of outrage. By June
the boy would be locked upstate. That night we
 
got down on our knees in my room. If I should die
 before I wake. Da said to me, it will be too soon.
 
 
II. 1991
 
Into the tented city we go, we-
akened by the fire’s ethereal
 
afterglow. Born lost and cool-
er than heartache. What we
 
know is what we know. The left
hand severed and school-
 
ed by cleverness. A plate of we-
ekdays cooking. The hour lurk-
 
ing in the afterglow. A late-
night chant. Into the city we
 
go. Close your eyes and strike
a blow. Light can be straight-
 
ened by its shadow. What we
break is what we hold. A sing-
 
ular blue note. An outcry sin-
ged exiting the throat. We
 
push until we thin, thin-
king we won’t creep back again.
 
While God licks his kin, we
sing until our blood is jazz,
 
we swing from June to June.
We sweat to keep from we-
 
eping. Groomed on a die-
t of hunger, we end too soon."
878,her tin skin,Evie Shockley,"i want her tin skin. i want
       her militant barbie breast,
resistant, cupped, no, cocked
       in the V of her elbow. i want
my curves mountainous
 
and locked. i want her
       arabesque eyes, i want her
tar markings, her curlicues,
       i want her tin skin. she
is a tree, her hair a forest
 
of strength. i want to be
       adorned with bottles. i
want my brownness

sculptor should have made

maker hewed her: with chain-

                                                          —after alison saar’s “compton nocturne”"
879,on new year’s eve,Evie Shockley,"we make midnight a maquette of the year:
frostlight glinting off snow to solemnize
       the vows we offer to ourselves in near
silence: the competition shimmerwise
 
       of champagne and chandeliers to attract
laughter and cheers: the glow from the fireplace
       reflecting the burning intra-red pact
between beloveds: we cosset the space
 
       of a fey hour, anxious gods molding our
hoped-for adams with this temporal clay:
       each of us edacious for shining or
rash enough to think sacrifice will stay
 
       this fugacious time: while stillness suspends
vitality in balance, as passions
       struggle with passions for sway, the mind wends
towards what’s to come: a callithump of fashions,
 
       ersatz smiles, crowded days: a bloodless cut
that severs soul from bone: a long aching
       quiet in which we will hear nothing but
the clean crack of our promises breaking."
880,The Sonnets: I,Ted Berrigan,"His piercing pince-nez. Some dim frieze
Hands point to a dim frieze, in the dark night.
In the book of his music the corners have straightened:
Which owe their presence to our sleeping hands.
The ox-blood from the hands which play
For fire for warmth for hands for growth
Is there room in the room that you room in?
Upon his structured tomb:
Still they mean something. For the dance
And the architecture.
Weave among incidents
May be portentous to him
We are the sleeping fragments of his sky,
Wind giving presence to fragments."
881,The Sonnets: III,Ted Berrigan,"Stronger than alcohol, more great than song,
deep in whose reeds great elephants decay,
I, an island, sail, and my shoes toss
on a fragrant evening, fraught with sadness
bristling hate.
It’s true, I weep too much. Dawns break
slow kisses on the eyelids of the sea,
what other men sometimes have thought they’ve seen.
And since then I’ve been bathing in the poem
lifting her shadowy flowers up for me,
and hurled by hurricanes to a birdless place
the waving flags, nor pass by prison ships
O let me burst, and I be lost at sea!
and fall on my knees then, womanly."
882,The Sonnets: L,Ted Berrigan,"I like to beat people up
absence of passion, principles, love. She murmurs
What just popped into my eye was a fiend’s umbrella
and if you should come and pinch me now
as I go out for coffee
. . . as I was saying winter of 18 lumps
Days produce life locations to banish 7 up
Nomads, my babies, where are you? Life’s
My dream which is gunfire in my poem
Orange cavities of dreams stir inside “The Poems”
Whatever is going to happen is already happening
Some people prefer “the interior monologue”
I like to beat people up"
883,The Sonnets: XLI,Ted Berrigan,"banging around in a cigarette      she isn’t “in love”
my dream a drink with Ira Hayes we discuss the code of the west
my hands make love to my body when my arms are around you
you never tell me your name
and I am forced to write “belly” when I mean “love”
Au revoir, scene!
I waken, read, write long letters and
wander restlessly when leaves are blowing
my dream a crumpled horn
in advance of the broken arm
she murmurs of signs to her fingers
weeps in the morning to waken so shackled with love
Not me. I like to beat people up.
My dream a white tree"
884,[We are the knife people . . .],John Spaulding,"We are the knife people, iron men, coat people
       and he-lands-sailing.
Souse eaters, house makers, husbands
       of kine and goat and swine, farm builders
       and keepers of kettle and scummer, word
       scratchers, corn stealers and bad sleepers.
 
As if towns could build themselves.
As if stumps jumped from the ground or
       flesh of beasts fell into trenchers.
As if paradise prevailed on earth.
To come to rich moulds and lush plantings,
       long-necked trees and tongues of land,
 
to redd the wild for the unborn.
       To reck not the peril.
Suffering snakes that may fly, wolves
       that may ravish. Kingdom
       of sachem and sagamore.
Kingdom of corn and thorny promise.
 
To satisfy our appetite of spirit,
       our thirst of property.
To seek not the opera of war but
       belittled by the possibilities
to stand silenced by the task before us—
 
these be my sudden and undigested thoughts."
885,where you are planted,Evie Shockley,"he’s as high as a georgia pine, my father’d say, half laughing. southern trees
as measure, metaphor. highways lined with kudzu-covered southern trees.
 
fuchsia, lavender, white, light pink, purple : crape myrtle bouquets burst
open on sturdy branches of skin-smooth bark : my favorite southern trees.
 
 one hundred degrees in the shade : we settle into still pools of humidity, moss-
dark, beneath live oaks. southern heat makes us grateful for southern trees.
 
the maples in our front yard flew in spring on helicopter wings. in fall, we
splashed in colored leaves, but never sought sap from these southern trees.
 
 frankly, my dear, that’s a magnolia, i tell her, fingering the deep green, nearly
plastic leaves, amazed how little a northern girl knows about southern trees.
 
i’ve never forgotten the charred bitter fruit of holiday’s poplars, nor will i :
it’s part of what makes me evie :  i grew up in the shadow of southern trees."
886,The Blight,James Lasdun,"What’s there to say? We didn’t care for him much,
and you can’t exactly commiserate
with someone you don’t just not love
but almost (admit it) hate.
So the news just hung over us
like the dud summer weather we’d had—
rain since June, the lawn sodden,
garden a bog, all slugs, late blight so bad
our sickened Beefsteak vines, our Sweet One Hundreds,
San Marzanos, the lot,
yellowed half black before the fruit had set,
which, when it did, began to bloat and rot
before it ripened—but like I say
(and not to speak ill of the dead)
we just didn’t care for him,
which is probably all there is to be said."
887,Blues for Samson,James Lasdun,"My stylist
calls me darling,
says Hi I’m Dee, and asks what I’d like today, smiling.
My hair back, I tell her, my precious locks,
thick and unruly and glossy as they were
before I was fleeced.

Her laughter
as she switches
the clippers on, brings back that sweet-throated witch’s
who comforted me as only your enemy can
in the days of my strength, when I smote
hip and thigh in a great slaughter.

Her nice eyes
by and by rest
on mine in the mirror. She leans in, letting her breast
brush against me. She knows her middle-aged man;
playing me like some trailer Delilah,
and I feel it rise;

the old blunt
want-instrument
that always and only wanted what it shouldn’t;
Gaza, Timna, my Valley girl
who spilled me in broad daylight. I must have reckoned
the sun shone out of her cunt.

Too long now
bereft of it,
a woman’s hands in my hair, or what’s left of it,
is all I seem to require of love, 
and all I’ll spill is a tip, Dee; big as my straitened
circumstances allow,

for Dee, once 
my head wasn’t bare
as that cornfield after the foxes I set on fire
rampaged through it, or the orchards and olive groves
I flattened with my slat-armored D9 ’dozer,
but maned like a lion’s."
888,The Death of Silence,Robin Ekiss,"A car’s backfire 
rifles the ear 

with skeleton clatter, 
the crowd’s walla walla

draws near, caterwaul 
evaporating in thin air. 

Silence is dead. 
(Long live silence.)

Let’s observe a moment 
of it, call it what it’s not: 

splatter of rain 
that can’t soothe

the window’s pane, 
dog barking 

up the wrong tree. 
Which tree, which air 

apparent is there to hear 
a word at its worth? 

Hammer that drums 
its water-logged warning 

against the side 
of the submarine: 

I’m buried to the hilt
like the knife, 

after it’s thrown, 
continues to bow

to the apple
it’s split."
889,Don’t Tell Anyone,Tony Hoagland,"We had been married for six or seven years 
when my wife, standing in the kitchen one afternoon, told me
that she screams underwater when she swims—

that, in fact, she has been screaming for years
into the blue chlorinated water of the community pool
where she does laps every other day.  

Buttering her toast, not as if she had been 
concealing anything, 
not as if I should consider myself

personally the cause of her screaming,
nor as if we should perform an act of therapy  
right that minute on the kitchen table,

—casually, she told me, 
and I could see her turn her square face up 
to take a gulp of oxygen,

then down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious.
For all I know, maybe everyone is screaming 
as they go through life, silently,

politely keeping the big secret 
that it is not all fun
to be ripped by the crooked beak

of something called psychology,
to be dipped down 
again and again into time;

that the truest, most intimate 
pleasure you can sometimes find
is the wet kiss 

of your own pain.
There goes Kath, at one pm, to swim her twenty-two laps
back and forth in the community pool; 

—what discipline she has!
Twenty-two laps like twenty-two pages, 
that will never be read by anyone."
890,End of Side A,Adrian Matejka,"It ends because the beginning won’t jumpstart 
again: red smudge of a mouth, lipstick everywhere

the afterthought a comet leaves on its way 
out. What makes this moment unfold like a fine 

woman raising herself up from the bathroom floor? 
Honky-tonk in the honeyed brown of an eyeball? 

Perfume & its circus of heart-shaped introductions? 
It ends because the needle always winds up in 

the lead-out, like a man pawing around for broken 
spectacles after he wakes in the world’s rubble. 

Hand over hand he paws, through stilted guitar 
picks & abandoned stilettos, raised skirts & rocks, 

glasses as chipped & smudged as the topography 
of a skipping record. He could be Albright 

himself, foraging the still-life swish of low-rise 
tutus & skyscrapers cracked in the twisted 

aftermath of a smile. Even without glasses, 
he remembers her in high style: magnanimously 

coming down the blue & violet threads of night, 
her green dress clashing with the bathroom tile."
891,Epilogue,Steve Gehrke,"For my daughter

If the body is primal, if the body is performed,
if the body is a city made of matches, 
something the self burns as it retreats,

if death is a victory, if death is a cascade,
if death is the moment when the pianist rises 
from the piano and the piano plays on,

if you are a theater, if you are the wandering 
troupe, if you have checked, lost traveler,
into the softest of hotels, if you already existed, 

in endless repetitions, like an echo which,
biopsied, grows to completion, like the flames 
on a candelabra, not just born from a single 

match, but wavering in the tip before it’s 
struck, the whole hive singularized, a queen 
subject to her ovaries, if the same horses 

grazing in me are grazing in you, if the body 
is a field written in hoofprints, the whole 
ghostly herd passing through, then I’ll meet you 

where the generations end, where the last gene 
evaporates, my invisible, my twin...And 
Fortinbras enters, followed closely by the wind."
892,For You Today,Jessica Greenbaum,"Of course there is a jackhammer. And a view, like Hopper,
but happier. Of course there is the newspaper—the daily
herald of our powerlessness. Easy go, easy come: thwash,
the next day another, an example of everything that gets done
in the dark. Like the initiative of the crocuses from a snow 
that was, as it works out, warming them. Or in this case,
the strange October weather warming them. There were the
conclusions we jumped to. To which we jumped. There was
pain, and then there was suffering. Of course there was my
ambition to offer you the world, but one that I have rearranged 
to make sense. Here are all the sensations of being alive
at the turn of the twenty-first century, here’s how they ring out
against each other, here’s how one brings out the sense of 
another, here is the yellow next to the fathomless blue."
893,I Had Just Hung Up from Talking to You,Jessica Greenbaum,"I had just hung up from talking to you
and we had been so immersed in the difficulty
you were facing, and forgive me,
I was thinking that as long as we kept talking,
you in your car in the parking lot of the boys’ school
as the afternoon deepened into early evening,
and me in the study, all the books around
that had been sources of beauty to us,
as long as we stayed in the conversation
padded with history like the floor of the pine forest, 
as long as I thought out loud, made a joke
at my own expense, you would be harbored in that exchange, 
but the boys were leaving the track
and after we hung up I looked out the window 
to see the top of the bare January trees spotlit to silvery red, 
massive but made from the thinnest
twigs at the ends of the branches at the ends of the limbs
they were waving and shining in a light
like no other and left only to them."
894,I Love You More Than All the Windows in New York City,Jessica Greenbaum,"The day turned into the city 
and the city turned into the mind
and the moving trucks trumbled along 
like loud worries speaking over
the bicycle’s idea
which wove between 
the more armored vehicles of expression
and over planks left by the construction workers
on a holiday morning when no work was being done
because no matter the day, we tend towards 
remaking parts of it—what we said 
or did, or how we looked—
and the buildings were like faces
lining the banks of a parade
obstructing and highlighting each other
defining height and width for each other
offsetting grace and function
like Audrey Hepburn from 
Jesse Owens, and the hearty pigeons collaborate 
with wrought iron fences
and become recurring choruses of memory
reassembling around benches
we sat in once, while seagulls wheel 
like immigrating thoughts, and never-leaving
chickadees hop bared hedges and low trees
like commas and semicolons, landing
where needed, separating 
subjects from adjectives, stringing along
the long ideas, showing how the cage
has no door, and the lights changed
so the tide of sound ebbed and returned
like our own breath
and when I knew everything
was going to look the same as the mind
I stopped at a lively corner
where the signs themselves were like
perpendicular dialects in conversation and
I put both my feet on the ground
took the bag from the basket
so pleased it had not been crushed
by the mightiness of all else
that goes on and gave you the sentence inside."
895,In the Corridor,Saskia Hamilton,"I passed through, I should have paused,
there were a hundred doors. One opened. 
In there, someone whose name 
is not yet known to me lived out 

his middle years in simple terms, two chairs, 
one place laid for early breakfast, one plate 
with dry toast and butter softening. There 
his mind raced through writings 

he had memorized long ago while he tried 
to get hold of himself. Once 
in his youth he had studied with love 
in the corners of old paintings 

matrices of fields and towns, 
passages intricate and particular, wheat, 
columns, figures and ground,
classically proportioned 

in lines that were meant 
to meet, eventually,
at vanishing point. They continued,
nevertheless; they troubled the eye.

He collected sets of books printed
in the nineteenth century, unyielding
pages, memoirs of the poets,
engravings of rurified private subjects 

in times of public sector unhappiness,
frescoes of human oddity in gatefold printing.
Why does it continue
to chasten me, he says to no one. 

It does. It is a painful mistaking,
this setting something down,
saying aloud, “it is nothing yet”
when he’d meant, not anything— 

but then nothing peered 
through the keyhole, nothing
took possession. Snow on the roofs,
snow in traces on the ground, 

passersby with wet trouser-cuffs 
looking to the pavement as the hill rises,
light gathering in the river 
and gradually spreading."
896,Map to the Stars,Adrian Matejka,"A Schwinn-ride away: Eagledale Plaza. Shopping strip of busted 
walkways, crooked parking spaces nicked like the lines 
on the sides of somebody’s mom-barbered head. Anchored 
by the Piccadilly disco, where a shootout was guaranteed every 
weekend, those gun claps: coughing stars shot from sideways
guns shiny enough to light the way for anyone willing to keep 
a head up long enough to see. Not me. I bought the Star Map 
Shirt for 15¢ at the Value Village next to the Piccadilly during
the daytime. The shirt was polyester with flyaway collars, 
outlined in the forgotten astronomies of disco. The shirt’s 
washed-out points of light: arranged in horse & hero shapes 
 & I rocked it in places neither horse nor hero hung out. 
Polyester is made from polyethylene & catches fire easily 
like wings near a thrift store sun. Polyethylene, used in shampoo 
bottles, gun cases, & those grocery sacks skidding like upended 
stars across the parking lot. There are more kinds of stars 
in this universe than salt granules on drive-thru fries. Too many 
stars, lessening & swelling with each pedal pump away from 
the Value Village as the electric billboard above flashes first 
one dui attorney, then another who speaks Spanish so the sky 
above is constantly chattering, like the biggest disco ball ever."
897,Miser Time,Kay Ryan,"Miser time grows
profligate near the 
end: unpinching 
and unplanning,
abandoning the
whole idea of
savings. It’s hard
to understand
but time apparently
expands with its
diminishing. The 
door thrown wide
on sliding hills of high-
denomination bills and 
nothing much to buy."
898,New Rooms,Kay Ryan,"The mind must
set itself up
wherever it goes
and it would be
most convenient
to impose its
old rooms—just
tack them up
like an interior
tent. Oh but
the new holes 
aren’t where 
the windows
went."
899,The New Self,Steve Gehrke,"Are you of or not of brain, matter’s boss 
              or its crevasse, are you the body itself, 
or more than that, immortal you, crouched
             in flesh, like a vampire packed into a bat? 

Are you housed in me or not? The tenant 
             or the landlord of my skin? Am I your 
avatar? Are you my East Berlin? Are we an I
             or each other’s synonym? Last night, 

the train I was on dimmed then re-electrified, 
             and I thought again that we are conscious 
a lot less often than we suppose, that half the time 
             in us you’re half reposed. I was in 

South Orange again, city of my former self’s last 
             stand. Do you remember him, your swallowed 
twin, the child king whom you deposed? Oh, 
             I know: you think you’re the buried light, 

the jeweled glow, the sunlight falling through 
             the falling snow. But I’ve seen the uranium 
laced through your walls: you’re an equation only 
             destruction solves. Who else but you

starts each day with masturbation and ends 
             each night with gin? And so how 
should I begin? Four years ago, you rose 
             in me like a fin. It started as an overflow, 

a drop of go, some royal beast in me, all gasoline 
             and yeast, unhinging its own jaw 
to accelerate the feast, the rails of thought so greased 
             that the outer world began to skew, 

as in that moment on a train when the view 
             becomes a wash of hues. There were clues. 
Phantom music in the air. At times, I’d look down 
             at my body and think, “How’d you get there?” 

One day, I de-napped to find myself entrapped 
             within the tangled logic of a subway 
map. All day, I’d refrain, I’d double-track. 
             I’d talk to myself and myself talked back. 

Was it you? That tick I felt within the trick 
             of thought? That wick that curled itself 
around me, not exploding, just making a constant 
             tick-tick-tick that finally convinced me 

that I was sick, that there was a cascade of toxins
             in the air, that there 
was something queer about the neighbor’s 
             stare, that charade of signals everywhere, 

an air raid in the brain, something in me
             left unpaid, a cosmic debt in arrears. 
Some nights, I’d hear the voices of my parents coming 
             near, like waves that overlapped—

she’d slap him, he’d slap her back—their rage 
             a single note that climbed its staff for years, 
my siblings and I in the closet with our fingers 
             in our ears, though still I heard one night 

the knife drawer heaved back, as if they really 
             might slice each other or the house in half, 
and then my thoughts unweaved and I began 
             to laugh. And it is funny, isn’t it,

the way that which starts as confession ends 
             in blame, this constant search 
for the marionettist of your brain, the ghost 
             who stole the controls to your soul.

The truth is: we embrace the past that keeps 
             us whole. Again, I feel that treble in the skin, 
something at the edge of sight but closing in, 
             the world a picture that won’t hang on the wall 

quite right. Again, the double agent of the heart 
             tries to take the past apart, but now I sense 
that the investigation is the crime, that it may be time 
             to give up on this which-is-which, 

this who-is-who, this endless voodoo in which the self 
             I am keeps evading the curses of the self 
I mean to be, or to admit at least that the lyric cracks 
             its voice trying to sing what’s ugly into praise, 

and this language is the jeweler’s bluff, a diamond 
             that scuffs between the teeth, a perfume misting 
foul air. Admit, admit, that what you craved 
             was sex those days, and after a one-night tryst,

you became convinced you’d contracted aids. 
             Say it plain: you thought you’d passed the disease 
on to your wife. In longhand, you wrote statistics 
             across the page, Googled infection rates, 

a one-in-a-million chance the battalion of hotline 
             workers liked to say, but they couldn’t smudge 
that chance away. And did you let this madness in
             to build a drama around your sin, 

to become valedictorian of the damned, to turn 
             from lion into lamb, as the murderer longs 
to be the murdered one, and the king to swap 
             places with the fool, the self you thought 

you were so undone that you could only blame it 
             on a coup, on a malignant growth, or on you, 
my patsy, my herring, my phantom non grata, my ghoul, 
             you who I insist must exist, because, if not, 

who else was it that could have been so cruel?"
900,Note to Reality,Tony Hoagland,"Without even knowing it, I have 
believed in you for a long time.

When I looked at my blood under a microscope
                I could see truth multiplying over and over.

—Not police sirens, nor history books, not stage-three lymphoma
                                                                                     persuaded me

but your honeycombs and beetles; the dry blond fascicles of grass 
                                                              thrust up above the January snow. 
Your postcards of Picasso and Matisse,
                                         from the museum series on European masters. 

When my friend died on the way to the hospital
                                           it was not his death that so amazed me

but that the driver of the cab 
                                              did not insist upon the fare.

Quotation marks: what should we put inside them? 

Shall I say “I”  “have been hurt” “by”  “you,”  you neglectful monster?

I speak now because experience has shown me
                                 that my mind will never be clear for long.

I am more thick-skinned and male, more selfish, jealous, and afraid
                                   than ever in my life.

“For my heart is tangled in thy nets;
                              my soul enmeshed in cataracts of time...”

The breeze so cool today, the sky smeared with bluish grays and whites.

The parade for the slain police officer
goes past the bakery

and the smell of fresh bread 
makes the mourners salivate against their will."
901,On the Ground,Saskia Hamilton,"When the collie saw the child
break from the crowd,

he gave chase, and since they both
were border-crossers,

they left this world. 
We were then made of—

affronted by—silence.
The train passed Poste 5, Paris,

late arrival, no luck, no
enlarging commentary

magnified in any glass.
“The ineffable

is everywhere in language”
the speaker had said 

in the huge hall where 
I sat amongst coughers, 

students, in the late 
February of that year,

at the end of a sinuous 
inquiry on sense and sound—

“and very close to the ground,” he’d said. 
Like mist risen above

the feet of animals
in a far field north of here."
902,A Poem for S.,Jessica Greenbaum,"Because you used to leaf through the dictionary,
Casually, as someone might in a barber shop, and
Devotedly, as someone might in a sanctuary,
Each letter would still have your attention if not
For the responsibilities life has tightly fit, like
Gears around the cog of you, like so many petals
Hinged on a daisy. That’s why I’ll just use your
Initial. Do you know that in one treasured story, a
Jewish ancestor, horseback in the woods at Yom
Kippur, and stranded without a prayer book,
Looked into the darkness and realized he had
Merely to name the alphabet to ask forgiveness—
No congregation of figures needed, he could speak
One letter at a time because all of creation
Proceeded from those. He fed his horse, and then
Quietly, because it was from his heart, he
Recited them slowly, from aleph to tav. Within those
Sounds, all others were born, all manner of
Trials, actions, emotions, everything needed to
Understand who he was, had been, how flaws
Venerate the human being, how aspirations return
Without spite. Now for you, may your wife’s
X-ray return with good news, may we raise our
Zarfs to both your names in the Great Book of Life."
903,Slugs,Brian Swann,"Who could have dreamed them up? At least snails
have shells, but all these have is—nothing.
Small black antennae like fat pins wave
as if they could take in enough to get them through.
Turn them over, they’re the soles of new shoes,
pale and unmarked as babies. They flow,
the soil itself learning how to move and, moving,
almost staying still, their silver monorail
the only evidence of where they’d been.
And they die quiet, or at least (thankfully)
out of the human ear’s range, between two stones,
under heels, shriveling in salt or piss, at the tips
of sharp sticks. Fight back, I hear myself say,
do something. Don’t just take it. But they die
as they had lived, exuding slime, like
the smaller boys, who’d just
stand there, miserable in short pants,
school socks down to their ankles,
school tie unknotted and askew, and flowing
from noses slow cauls of snot that
from time to time they’d lick or sniff back up
part way, until it flowed again, coating
the upper lip, falling into the mouth, mixing
with tears before anything had been done,
the fear itself enough, so even if we wanted
we couldn’t let them off. Sometimes it was
the knee “where you daren’t show your mother,”
other times the kick in the shins, the stick over
the head, the punch in the mouth, while they
just stood there, or double up, gasping
for breath, and we did it again."
904,Tempo for a Winged Instrument,Katharine Coles,"Full of light and music, the beating air.  

Light like a bird, Calvino says, not a feather.  

Over the water the shags come in to land

All wings, uh-ohing over the cliffs.

Rock, their nests, and bare the rookeries.  

Blue eye, blue eye, the wind plays fast and sharp.

They lift and ride and do not pick their fights.  

Oh, blue sky, blue day. Heart

Of muscle, thrumming down, and swift."
905,There Is No Word,Tony Hoagland,"There isn’t a word for walking out of the grocery store
with a gallon jug of milk in a plastic sack 
that should have been bagged in double layers

—so that before you are even out the door
you feel the weight of the jug dragging 
the bag down, stretching the thin

plastic handles longer and longer
and you know it’s only a matter of time until
bottom suddenly splits. 

There is no single, unimpeachable word 
for that vague sensation of something
moving away from you

as it exceeds its elastic capacity        
—which is too bad, because that is the word
I would like to use to describe standing on the street

chatting with an old friend 
as the awareness grows in me that he is
no longer a friend, but only an acquaintance, 

a person with whom I never made the effort—
until this moment, when as we say goodbye 
I think we share a feeling of relief,  

a recognition that we have reached
the end of a pretense,   
though to tell the truth 

what I already am thinking about
is my gratitude for language—
how it will stretch just so much and no farther;

how there are some holes it will not cover up;
how it will move, if not inside, then 
around the circumference of almost anything—

how, over the years, it has given me
back all the hours and days, all the 
plodding love and faith, all the

misunderstandings and secrets
I have willingly poured into it."
906,Turkey Fallen Dead from Tree,Dore Kiesselbach,"Startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor’s mutt, 
it banged its buzzard’s head then couldn’t solve 
the problem of the white pine’s limbs 
with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent. 
Somewhere an awkward angel knows 
whether it was dead before it hit the ground.
Any sinner could tell it was dead after—
eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids,
feet drawn up almost as high as hands.
I loved to watch thistle and millet 
disappear beneath it in the yard.
As snow covers feathers that will still be 
iridescent in the spring I remember seeing 
a businessman take a dripping handful 
of pocket change and throw it down 
a subway grate beside a homeless man. 
The coins bounced and clattered, vanishing 
in the humid dark. The rich man said 
now you’re having a shitty day too. 
But it’s not a shitty day and won’t be 
when I retrieve the bird and walk it—
toes curling stiff from a shopping bag—
to a houseless scrap of oak savannah 
birdseed drew it from and dig it 
into deeper snow so what was hoarded 
by a man may by the thaw be doled."
907,Unemployment (1),Mark Levine,"I had a calling.
I took the call.
It was all I could do to follow the voice streaming into me
Like traffic on the runway where I lay
Down to gather.
I had a calling. I heard the geese bleat
In the firmament as they migrated
Into the jet’s jets.
And could I have foreseen that falling
I could have fallen too
Rather than being sutured to the bottomless
Freeze-out lake.
For it is fine to lie within one’s borrowed blankets
Looking up at the 
Dropped ceiling coming down.
For at the moment I am employed counting the holes
In the sound absorbing tiles
Keeping a running record of the interlocutor’s 
Chides.
I feel at one with extinction
By my own hand
(Inner hand)
Though once there were many of my kind
Flocking inland, or perhaps
It felt that way."
908,Unemployment (2),Mark Levine,"Another day come, add it 
To the list, the
Not to do list.
Son of mine,
I was rambling across the undercarpeting
Strewn with imperceptible tacks
In one shapeless slip-on
When a pain rang out in my flank
And I fell to,
Braying,
But who should answer but no one.
I lost good cause that day, don’t ask,
Let us sit a bit in this ill-starred
Suit in the form-filling
Chamber of subtraction,
Listing.
I haven’t another trip around the sun 
Left in me. Speak to me
Son, vague one. 
For this is where it thickens,
Me here and it there and me there and them here
And you with the soul.
I’ll cross that gravid boneyard 
All the day poking 
Radishes for remembrance.
For this is a private matter 
Between a man and his scaffolding
And it shall remain so 
Privation permitting."
909,Unemployment (3),Mark Levine,"Out of cash, out of well-fitting trousers,
Out of soap and apples,
Out of pencils, out of my keeper’s
Reach. 

I wish to set myself afire
But may not. This morning
(Last night) in the common room 
I watched the administration
Of oxygen to one who had none

And I would not sit down, demanding
To do so.

Later I happened on a man
At the piano, and though I have happened five or six times 
On men at the piano,
None moved his hand like this
Within the keys.

I sat beside him, looking for a sound
A chest sound. Not listening; I don’t listen
Anymore. I make music
But I don’t listen."
910,Your Other Heart,Natalie Shapero,"Mossy and thumping, bare of logic, red:
             why do they say your other head

                          and not your other heart? 

The snack cakes of Smut Wonderland
turn Alice smaller than her dress. She stirs,
nude in the folds of so much baby blue. 

             To think, they called this lesser art.

I ate mostly orders then, and you—
you were thinking with your other heart. 

I took in a dog the way some might take in
             a dress (I had become just skin).

                          It coughed. I cried for it

to stop, I fed it meat, its malady
recurrent and untreatable. I had 
to give it up, like some bum body part 

             whose incidental benefit

the human form has out-evolved. Don’t start.
That dog: I called it Help, and I cried for it."
911,Zwijgen,Saskia Hamilton,"I slept before a wall of books and they
calmed everything in the room, even
their contents, even me, woken
by the cold and thrill, and still
they said, like the Dutch verb for falling 
silent that English has no accommodation for
in the attics and rafters of its intimacies."
912,Dirty Face,Shel Silverstein,"Where did you get such a dirty face,
My darling dirty-faced child?
 
I got it from crawling along in the dirt
And biting two buttons off Jeremy’s shirt.
I got it from chewing the roots of a rose
And digging for clams in the yard with my nose.
I got it from peeking into a dark cave
And painting myself like a Navajo brave.
I got it from playing with coal in the bin
And signing my name in cement with my chin.
I got it from rolling around on the rug
And giving the horrible dog a big hug.
I got it from finding a lost silver mine
And eating sweet blackberries right off the vine.
I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears
And from having more fun than you’ve had in years."
913,Openin’ Night,Shel Silverstein,"She had the jitters
She had the flu
She showed up late
She missed her cue
She kicked the director
She screamed at the crew
And tripped on a prop
And fell in some goo
And ripped her costume
A place or two
Then she forgot
A line she knew
And went “Meow”
Instead of “Moo”
She heard ‘em giggle
She heard ‘em boo
The programs sailed
The popcorn flew
As she stomped offstage
With a boo-hoo-hoo
The fringe of the curtain
Got caught in her shoe
The set crashed down
The lights did too
Maybe that’s why she didn’t want to do
An interview."
914,When I Am Gone,Shel Silverstein,"When I am gone what will you do?
Who will write and draw for you?
Someone smarter—someone new?
Someone better—maybe YOU!"
915,Be Someone,Rita Ann Higgins,"For Christ’s sake,
learn to type
and have something
to fall back on.
 
Be someone,
make something of yourself,
look at Gertrudo Ganley.
 
Always draw the curtains
when the lights are on.
 
Have nothing to do
with the Shantalla gang,
get yourself a right man
with a Humber Sceptre.
 
For Christ’s sake
wash your neck
before going into God’s house.
 
Learn to speak properly,
always pronounce your ings.
Never smoke on the street,
don’t be caught dead
in them shameful tight slacks,
 
spare the butter,
economise,
 
and for Christ’s sake
at all times,
watch your language."
916,Lament for the Feet,H. L. Hix,"Except a six-year pony penned from birth
 inside a barn, I never seen anything worse.
Eleven dobermans and mixed breeds, some still pups,
removed from a residence after anonymous tips
about a dead dog decomposing on the porch.
 Still and yet, this many dogs almost beats that one horse.
The problem of human freedom one might couch
in other terms than Kant’s. It’s nasty in there.
 Dog shit everywhere. I don’t see how she could breathe.
The woman, nearly ninety, wept and pleaded
with the workers. I’ve been raising dogs right here
 in this very house since before your mothers were born.
 If I’m treating these dogs as bad as you say,
 how come you need those chokers to drag them away?
The Humane Society truck’s radio, left on,
played “Me and Bobby McGee.” They were strays, unwanted.
 I fed them and gave them a home. Now you’ll kill them
 and call me cruel. And who will protect me?
 How will I sleep? When asked, the welfare worker
said the woman cannot be forced from her home.
But freedom of will is not freedom from necessity
and obligation. The neighbors lost interest soon
and left her lawn. Meanwhile a breeze blows in
from the Gulf on a girl showing her friends the spot where
she lost her left foot to a shark. He kept twisting it
 like a dog with a rag, she says just to hear them squeal.
 Really, he only managed to take a chunk and maul
 the rest, but the doctors had to amputate.
She had to learn to trust loss. And in Houston
a boy tries to jimmy a padlock with a broom
to free his six-year-old sister from the storage shed
their parents told them was “the naughty room.”
 She was causing trouble at school, wetting her bed,
 and threatening to run away. We made a decision.
 We thought a few hours here was best for her.
Police said the girl had been left water.
A person may purchase the wind and the sun
at the price of perpetual peregrination."
917,Philomena’s Revenge,Rita Ann Higgins,"As a teenager
she was like any other,
boys, the craic,
smoking down the backs.
 
Later there was talk
she broke things,
furniture and glass,
her mother’s heart.
 
‘Mad at the world,’
the old women nod,
round each other’s faces.
 
But it was more
than that
and for less
she was punished.
 
That weekend
she didn’t leave a cup alone
every chair hit the wall,
Philomena’s revenge.
 
Soon after
she was shifted
and given the shocks.
 
Round each other’s faces
the old women nod
‘Treatment, treatment
they’ve given her the treatment.’
 
These days
she gets on with the furniture,
wears someone else’s walk,
sees visions in glass.
 
She’s good too
for getting the messages;
small things, bread and milk
sometimes the paper,
 
and closing the gate
after her father drives out,
she waits for his signal
he always shouts twice,
 
‘Get the gate Philo,
get the gate, girl.’"
918,The Arrival,Patricia Goedicke,"Luggage first, the lining of his suit jacket dangling
As always, just when you’d given up hope
Nimbly he backs out of the taxi

Eyes nervously extending, like brave crabs
Everywhere at once, keeping track of his papers
He pilots himself into the home berth

Like a small tug in a cloud of seagulls
Worries flutter around him so thick
It takes him some time to arrive

And you wonder if he’s ever really been happy:
When the blue eyes blur
And stare out to sea

Whether it’s only a daydream
Or a long pain that silences him
In such gray distances

You’ll never know, but now
Turning to you, the delicate mouth
Like a magician

Is curious, sensitive, playing tricks,
Pouting like a wise turtle
It seems he has a secret

With the driver,
With the stewardess on the airplane
So that even when he opens his arms

When the warm voice surrounds you,
Wraps you in rough bliss,
Just before you go under

Suddenly you remember:
The beloved does not come
From nowhere: out of himself, alone

Often he comes slowly, carefully
After a long taxi ride
Past many beautiful men and women

And many dead bodies,
Mysterious and important companions."
919,And the Gauchos Sing,Mike Puican,"For Barry Silesky

Catalpas blooming up and down Catalpa Street, car alarms blooming 
up and down Waveland Avenue—an instant of nature without the narrative. 
O face-in-your-morning-juice, swimmer-in-an-old-wool-suit, 
we sit side by side on the steps smoking the same cigarette, 
watching children who live alone, women married to the wrong men.  

Here is your little dog roaming the alley. What will he do for love this time? 
The gauchos sing: “The silver lights of stars hurl themselves 
against the open pampas of Clark Street” O tomato-in-a-woman’s-palm, 
one millisecond following the next millisecond, “Heal thyself,” 
the poem says, “Pick up your beggar’s mat and walk.” 

You hurl yourself into traffic. You talk to cops and street thugs;
they smile at their smartphones.  They strut in the sun like jackals 
after a kill. And the gauchos sing: “Everyone will finally leave you, fugitive.” 
A cloud of pigeons cuts through the smog. Everyone will finally leave you.

When the bus comes we sing like sailors. A red sky presses you to its lips. 
I tell you that everything has already been written. You say 
on a long, difficult pilgrimage Basho wrote on his hat."
920,Big City Speech,W. S. Di Piero,"Use me
Abuse me
            Turn wheels of ﬁre
            on manhole hotheads

Sing me
Sour me
            Secrete dark matter’s sheen
            on our smarting skin

Rise and shine
In puddle shallows
            under every Meryl Cheryl Caleb Syd
            somnambulists and sleepyheads

Wake us
Speak to us
            Bless what you’ve nurtured in your pits
            the rats voles roaches and all outlivers
            of your obscene ethic and politics

Crawl on us 
Fall on us
            you elevations that break and vein
            down to sulfuric ﬁber-optic wrecks
            through drill-bit dirt to bedrock

Beat our brows
Flee our sorrows

            Sleep tight with your ultraviolets
            righteous mica and drainage seeps

your gorgeous color-chart container ships
and cab-top numbers squinting in the mist"
921,Christmas Trees,William Logan,"How should I now recall
the icy lace of the pane
like a sheet of cellophane,
or the skies of alcohol

poured over the saltbox town?
On that stony New England tableau,
the halo of falling snow
glared like a waxy crown.

Through blue frozen lots
my giant parents strolled,
wrapped tight against the cold
like woolen Argonauts,

searching for that tall
perfection of Scotch pine
from the hundreds laid in line
like the dead at Guadalcanal.

The clapboard village aglow
that starry stark December
I barely now remember,
or the brutish ache of snow

burning my face like quicklime.
Yet one thing was still missing.
I saw my parents kissing,
perhaps for the last time."
922,Desert,Josephine Miles,"When with the skin you do acknowledge drought,
The dry in the voice, the lightness of feet, the fine
Flake of the heat at every level line;

When with the hand you learn to touch without
Surprise the spine for the leaf, the prickled petal,
The stone scorched in the shine, and the wood brittle;

Then where the pipe drips and the fronds sprout
And the foot-square forest of clover blooms in sand,
You will lean and watch, but never touch with your hand.

 September 1934"
923,Dusting,Rita Dove,"Every day a wilderness—no
shade in sight. Beulah
patient among knickknacks,
the solarium a rage
of light, a grainstorm
as her gray cloth brings
dark wood to life.

Under her hand scrolls
and crests gleam
darker still. What
was his name, that
silly boy at the fair with
the rifle booth? And his kiss and
the clear bowl with one bright
fish, rippling
wound!

Not Michael—
something finer. Each dust
stroke a deep breath and
the canary in bloom.
Wavery memory: home
from a dance, the front door
blown open and the parlor
in snow, she rushed
the bowl to the stove, watched
as the locket of ice
dissolved and he
swam free.

That was years before
Father gave her up
with her name, years before
her name grew to mean
Promise, then
Desert-in-Peace.
Long before the shadow and
sun’s accomplice, the tree.

Maurice.

 November 1981"
924,Early Elegy: Headmistress,Claudia Emerson,"The word itself: prim, retired, its artifact 
her portrait above the fireplace, on her face 
the boredom she abhorred, then perfected, 
her hands held upward—their emptiness 
a revision, cigarette and brandy snifter 
painted, intolerably, out, to leave her this 
lesser gesture: What next? or shrugged Whatever.
From the waist down she was never there."
925,Early Elegy: Smallpox,Claudia Emerson,"The world has certified itself rid of 
all but the argument: to eradicate or not 
the small stock of variola frozen, 
quarantined—a dormancy it has 
refused, just once, for a woman behind a sterile 
lens, her glass slide a clearest, most 
becoming pane. How could it resist slipping 
away with her, that discrete first pock?"
926,From “The Hollow Hill”,Kathleen Raine,"Smaller than pollen-grain, smaller than seed
Of bitter berry red—
Do not look for the small,
The door has no size at all.

Some of sorrow have made a well
And deep have seen
In daylight far stars glimmer pale
In a nether heaven.

April 1963"
927,Girl with Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer,W. S. Di Piero,"He put the spirit essence
the light pip not only
in each eye’s albumen
concentrate of starlight
but must have been taught
how to do that by first
finding it in the pearl
he posed then corrected
in dusty studio light
that pounced on the window
behind which sits the cheeky girl
pear- and apple-blossom cheeks
a fake description naturally
of their plain fleshiness
drably golden and her lips
from Haight Street’s darlings
nose studs jacket studs
girls with that kind of eye
one by the atm machine
casual juicy and so fair
a Netherlandish type
panhandling strangers
pomegranate seed ball
bearings agleam in her nose
pearls not sea-harvested
but imagined seen put there
by a certain need and fancy
because love says it’s so
picture that picture this."
928,Gooseberry Fool,Amy Clampitt,"The gooseberry’s no doubt an oddity,
an outlaw or pariah even—thorny
and tart as any
kindergarten martinet, it can harbor
like a fernseed, on its leaves’ under-
side, bad news for pine trees,
whereas the spruce
resists the blister rust
it’s host to. That veiny Chinese
lantern, its stolid jelly
of a fruit, not only has 
no aroma but is twice as tedious
as the wild strawberry’s sunburst
stem-end appendage: each one must
be between-nail-snipped at both extremities.

Altogether, gooseberry virtues
take some getting
used to, as does trepang,
tripe à la mode de Caen,
or having turned thirteen.
The acerbity of all things green
and adolescent lingers in 
it—the arrogant, shrinking,
prickling-in-every-direction thorn-
iness that loves no company except its,
or anyhow that’s what it gets:
bristling up through gooseberry ghetto sprawl
are braced thistles’ silvery, militantly symmetrical
defense machineries. Likewise inseparably en-
tangled in the disarray of an
uncultivated childhood, where gooseberry bushes (since
rooted out) once flourished, is
the squandered volupté of lemon-
yellow-petaled roses’ luscious flimflam—
an inkling of the mingling into one experience
of suave and sharp, whose supremely im-
probable and far-fetched culinary
embodiment is a gooseberry fool.

Tomorrow, having stumbled into
this trove of chief ingredients
(the other being very thickest cream)
I’ll demonstrate it for you. Ever since,
four summers ago, I first brought you,
a gleeful Ariel, the trophy
of a small sour handful,
I’ve wondered what not quite articulated thing
could render magical 
the green globe of an unripe berry.
I think now it was simply
the great globe itself’s too much to carry.

December 1981"
929,The Green Man,W. S. Di Piero,"rumdumb from last night’s shrubbery tryst
exhales soot, fernseed, shoots and vines,
brings his hot breath from the city park’s wood,
saying a song we don’t understand
through the briar and bay leaves of his beard.
And in Philadelphia, 1954,
out of late autumn’s darkening he came,
a junkman lugging a Penn Fruit cart,
straw bristling his face, crying a name.
Or from manholes in other cities,
his holographic ectoplasm greets us
when traffic lights turn green.
Uncover and there he is, membranous
Caliban alone with sewer rats,
or stumblebum Puck, unnameable solids
crusting nails and toes, bringing us his dark.
Or our neighborhood’s soused John-John,
cobra down-at-heel boots skidding
at my feet among the maddening jasmine,
when I grab too late to save him growls:
“I can save you darling pigs.
Behold, behold, and maybe I’ll help.”"
930,Heraclitean,Kim Addonizio,"In goes the cafeteria worker in her hairnet.
In goes the philosophy teacher
explaining the theory of eternal
return, and Anton Stadler with his clarinet,
still owing money to Mozart. In
goes Mozart. Everyone flopped into the creel
of the happy fisherman, everyone eaten.
Every river is Lethean,
so why should we care 
if it’s not the same river? I hate
how everything changes, tree
to failing term paper, chatelaine
to beheaded plotter, drug dealer to narc.
The heart softening faster than cereal
but then hardening to a relic
which turns into another line
of depressed poetry to recite
to the next eager trainee
anxious to be more than lint.
Going up, you’re also going down, so either
way, as your mother said, Be nice.
When she went in, she was very thin.
Earth, air, fire, water, mother.
Fish pulse slowly under the river ice."
931,Increment,Josephine Miles,"So populous the region
That from the next region
The crowing of children, barking of cars could be heard,
So that a continuous linkage
Of sounds of living ran
In the limber air,
District to district, Woodlake to Montclair,
Freestone to Smithfield, and one child’s cry
Was not concealed from any trade route,
Or passer by,
Or upstairs island of thought withdrawn, 
Or basement of submerged magnificence.
One crow
Welkened the evening sky,
Bark blasted the dark,
Like an assertion in a time of assent,
Or an increase to astonishment.

June 1958"
932,Invocation,Denise Levertov,"Silent, about-to-be-parted-from house.
Wood creaking, trying to sigh, impatient.
Clicking of squirrel-teeth in the attic.
Denuded beds, couches stripped of serapes.

Deep snow shall block all entrances
and oppress the roof and darken
the windows.    O Lares,
don’t leave.
The house yawns like a bear.
Guard its profound dreams for us,
that it return to us when we return.

November 1969"
933,Knowledge,Louise Bogan,"Now that I know
That passion warms little
Of flesh in the mold, 
And treasure is brittle,

I’ll lie here and learn
How, over their ground,
Trees make a long shadow
And a light sound.

August 1922"
934,"Miss Snooks, Poetess",Stevie Smith,"Miss Snooks was really awfully nice
And never wrote a poem
That was not really awfully nice
And fitted to a woman,

She therefore made no enemies
And gave no sad surprises
But went on being awfully nice
And took a lot of prizes.

November 1964"
935,The Mother,Ruth Stone,"Here where the rooms are dryly still
Who is this dustily asleep
While juicy children run the field?

Where is her ever deepening well
Whose buckets to a fullness dip
For needs compassion must fulfill?

Like freshets they themselves may yield
A little to the turned up cup,
But death is in the long dry spell.

Run children, run, the light grows dull,
And she who keeps the well must sleep,
And rain is unpredictable.

December 1951"
936,Moving Things,W. S. Di Piero,"My aunts mentioned her just once,
calling her my aunt, their sister,
though she wasn’t. They mentioned
the vinyl recliner in the kitchen,
the “I Like Ike” poster, the Sacred Heart,
cabbage smells, sulfur, and shame.

Before jolted by the gift that called
through but never really for her,
she became unpleasantly calm.
Moments later, after she said
“I don’t want this please,” God’s love
raced down the pulse into her look.

It was as if her things spoke back:
a table leg scraped the floor, a fork
wobbled in a drawer, knickknacks fell.
She nearly died each time it happened.
They said her mind just wasn’t there,
or she wasn’t in it anymore.

She sat helpless afterward,
papery when they lifted her
from vision seat to bed. The might
to move what her eye fell upon
is the image of her I keep,
her iridescent readiness."
937,New Endymion,W. S. Di Piero,"She visits still too much, dressed in aromas
of fir needles, mango, mold: I still get lost
knowing she’s close, me not getting younger
or more conscious. Sometimes I fantasticate
I’m broad awake: her witchy presence waits
for me to jump into her arms, but then she’s just
an incoherent ache in sleep’s freaked scenes.
I feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wrists
vaporing nooses around my head and feet
and genitals, conjuring my drab hair
into a party bowl of oiled, desirable locks.
She makes me nervous, but what would I do
without her? So long as I can’t have her,
I want her and this alarming manic frequency.
Then again, who wants to wake to change,
its pulped, smelly suit of meat, drawing flies?
My night-watch hot girl, moon-maiden, mom,
let me get just one night’s sleep without regret,
released from your foxy ticklish fondlings,
your latest smell of windblown fresh-cut grass."
938,Northumberland House,Stevie Smith,"I was always a thoughtful youngster,
Said the lady on the omnibus,
I remember Father used to say,
You are more thoughtful than us.

I was sensitive too, the least thing
Upset me so much,
I used to cry if a fly
Stuck in the hatch.

Mother always said,
Elsie is too good,
There’ll never be another like Elsie,
Touch wood. 

I liked to be alone,
Sitting on the garden path,
My brother said he’d never seen a
Picture more like Faith in the Arena.

They were kindly people, my people,
I could not help being different,
And I think it was good for me
Mixing in a different element.

The poor lady now burst out crying
And I saw her friend was not a friend but a nurse
For she said, Cheer up duckie the next stop is ours,
They got off at Northumberland House.

This great House of the Percies
Is now a lunatic asylum,
But over the gate there still stands
The great Northumberland Lion.

This family animal’s tail
Is peculiar in that it is absolutely straight,
And straight as a bar it stood out to drop after them
As they went through the gate.

November 1964"
939,November for Beginners,Rita Dove,"Snow would be the easy
way out—that softening
sky like a sigh of relief
at finally being allowed
to yield. No dice.
We stack twigs for burning
in glistening patches
but the rain won’t give.

So we wait, breeding
mood, making music
of decline. We sit down
in the smell of the past
and rise in a light
that is already leaving.
We ache in secret,
memorizing

a gloomy line
or two of German.
When spring comes
we promise to act
the fool. Pour,
rain! Sail, wind,
with your cargo of zithers!

November 1981"
940,On a Picture by Cézanne,W. S. Di Piero,"There’s no description in the braided stone,
the pear, the stone in the pear, the birchbark,
bread hills on the snowfall tablecloth.
The dog of work gnaws the day’s short bone,
snarls a mountainside into lavender and green.
In the mind where objects vanish, almost is all.
Element of pitcher, sky, rockface, blank canvas
plastic and vast in one off-center patch.
To copy what’s invisible, to improvise
a soul of things and remake solid life
into fresh anxious unlifelike form."
941,Peach Farm,Dean Young,"I’m thinking it’s time to go back
to the peach farm or rather
the peach farm seems to be wanting me back
even though the work of picking, sorting,
the sticky perils and sudden swarms are done.
Okay, full disclosure, I’ve never
been on a peach farm, just glimpsed
from a car squat trees I assumed
were peach and knew a couple in school
who went off one summer, so they said, 
to work on a peach farm. She was pregnant,
he didn’t have much intention, canvases
of crushed lightbulbs and screws in paste.
He’d gotten fired from the lunch counter
for putting too much meat
on the sandwiches of his friends
then ended up in Macy’s in New York
selling caviar and she went home
I think to Scranton, two more versions
of never hearing from someone again.
I’d like to say the most important fruits
are within but that’s the very sort of bullshit
one goes to the peach farm to avoid,
not just flight from quadratic equations,
waiting for the plumber,
finding out your insurance won’t pay.
Everyone wants out of the spider’s stomach.
Everyone wants to be part of some harvest
and stop coughing to death and cursing 
at nothing and waking up nowhere near
an orchard. Look at these baskets,
bashed about, nearly ruined with good employ.
Often, after you’ve spent a day on a ladder,
you dream of angels, the one with the trumpet
and free subscriptions to the New Yorker
or the archer, the oink angel, angel
of ten dollar bills found in the dryer
or the one who welcomes you in work gloves
and says if you’re caught eating a single peach,
even windfall, you’ll be executed.
Then laughs. It’s okay, kiddo,
long as you’re here, you’re one of us."
942,The Pear,Ruth Stone,"There hangs this bellied pear, let no rake doubt,
Meat for the tongue and febrile to the skin,
Wasting for the mildew and the rot, 
A tallow rump slow rounded, a pelt thin
And for the quickest bite; so, orchard bred,
Heaviest downward from the shaking stem.
Whose fingers curve around the ripened head
Lust to split so fine a diadem.

There is the picker, stretches for the knife,
There are the ravening who claw the fruit,
More, those adjuring wax that lasts a life,
And foxes, freak for cunning, after loot.
For that sweet suck the hornet whines his wits, 
But husbandman will dry her for the pits.

December 1951"
943,Scythe,Stuart Dybek,"In the barn demoted to garage,
the ax in a cherry stump can’t be budged.

Daylight perforates siding despite
the battered armor of license plates—

corroded colors, same state: decay,
their dates the only history 

of whoever tilled the soil 
and left, as a welcome, the skull 

of a possum nailed to the door, and the trail
of lime to the torn sack  

in a corner where cobwebs festoon a scythe.
Rusted sharp, it sings 

when he grips its splintery handle, swings, 
and crowns topple from Queen Anne’s lace."
944,The Shoe Box,W. S. Di Piero,"A high school mash note’s stammering lust.
Father and me, shirts and ties, snapshot glare,
and somehow graphed into that air
a young man’s foolscap poem when a just,
loose joinery of words was all that mattered.
But then in last night’s dream, she (mother, wife,
mash note’s love?) tells me a box holding secret life
has been shipped, enclosing sounds I haven’t heard:
a wind-harp’s warp, words yarding across staves,
fluty sounds ribboned to sad, screechy tunes.
And things: a wishbone, ring, whatever I crave,
the heart-hollows, the cannot-do-withouts, the whens
and whos, the frayed veils between death and here...
I packed this box myself. I packed it full of fear."
945,Solo R&B Vocal Underground,W. S. Di Piero,"It seems to head from its last stop too fast,
my transbay train’s strung-out hoo, deep
inside the tunnel, and starts to bleed
into the baritone wail of that guy
at platform’s end, a sort of lullaby
rubbed against the wall then caught in a squall
of wind darkening toward us, his whippy voice
skinning its tired song off the tiled dome:
he’s determined, the silky lyric says,
to be independently blue, while we all
wait to be chuted to car lot or home,
closer to love, or farther, and sooner to loss,
our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed,
every plural presence now some thing alone,
thanks to our singer-man. We wait for the train,
patient with hope, a hope that’s like complaint."
946,The Supplicant,Stuart Dybek,"prays for birds before an ancient icon— a stray cat. The inbred need to pray is what makes God necessary, and not, she says, the other way around; beyond that it’s all mystery, so don’t question why Man creates gods that demand sacrifice, condemning mortals to spend their lives trying to praise godhead into mercy. Better instead to ask the frog to bless the fly, and, once the cheese is in the trap, to beg forgiveness from the rat."
947,Their Story,Stuart Dybek,"They were nearing the end of their story.
The fire was dying, like the fire in the story.
Each page turned was torn and fed
to flames, until word by word the book 
burned down to an unmade bed of ash. 
Wet kindling from an orchard of wooden spoons,  
snow stewing, same old wind on the Gramophone,
same old wounds. Turn up the blue dial
under the kettle until darkness boils
with fables, and mirrors defrost to the quick
before fogging with steam, and dreams
rattle their armor of stovepipes and ladles.
Boots in the corner kick in their sleep.
A jacket hangs from a question mark."
948,Campaign,Ciaran Carson,"They had questioned him for hours. Who exactly was he? And when
He told them, they questioned him again. When they accepted who he was, as
Someone not involved, they pulled out his fingernails. Then
They took him to a waste-ground somewhere near the Horseshoe Bend, and told him
What he was. They shot him nine times.
 
A dark umbilicus of smoke was rising from a heap of burning tyres.
The bad smell he smelt was the smell of himself. Broken glass and knotted Durex.
The knuckles of a face in a nylon stocking. I used to see him in the Gladstone Bar,
Drawing pints for strangers, his almost perfect fingers flecked with scum."
949,Collaboration,Ciaran Carson,"I am being paraded through the streets with my head shaved,
with no memory of what I have done to deserve this.
 
I run a gauntlet of women who call me slut and whore,
staggering under their fusillade of accusation:
 
What stories did I tell, what lies? What names did I reveal?
What men did I sleep with? What did I do? For what reward?
 
Or in a catacomb deep under Paris they press gloves
of barbed wire on to my bare hands, and when the wounds have healed
 
they point to the brambles left on my palms, saying, Surely
these lines of head and heart and mind are those of a traitor.
 
When you wake I hold you tight, saying, It’s only a dream,
the language of dream has nothing to do with that of life.
 
And as eventually you sink back into the deep well
of sleep, I wonder if by my words I have betrayed you."
950,Family Stories,Dorianne Laux,"I had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family,
how an argument once ended when his father
seized a lit birthday cake in both hands
and hurled it out a second-story window. That,
I thought, was what a normal family was like: anger
sent out across the sill, landing like a gift
to decorate the sidewalk below. In mine
it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexus,
and nobody ever forgave anyone. But I believed
the people in his stories really loved one another,
even when they yelled and shoved their feet
through cabinet doors, or held a chair like a bottle
of cheap champagne, christening the wall,
rungs exploding from their holes.
I said it sounded harmless, the pomp and fury
of the passionate. He said it was a curse
being born Italian and Catholic and when he
looked from that window what he saw was the moment
rudely crushed. But all I could see was a gorgeous
three-layer cake gliding like a battered ship
down the sidewalk, the smoking candles broken, sunk
deep in the icing, a few still burning."
951,The Fetch,Ciaran Carson,"I woke. You were lying beside me in the double bed,
prone, your long dark hair fanned out over the downy pillow.
 
I’d been dreaming we stood on a beach an ocean away
watching the waves purl into their troughs and tumble over.
 
Knit one, purl two, you said. Something in your voice made me think
of women knitting by the guillotine. Your eyes met mine.
 
The fetch of a wave is the distance it travels, you said,
from where it is born at sea to where it founders to shore.
 
I must go back to where it all began. You waded in
thigh-deep, waist-deep, breast-deep, head-deep, until you disappeared.
 
I lay there and thought how glad I was to find you again.
You stirred in the bed and moaned something. I heard a footfall
 
on the landing, the rasp of a man’s cough. He put his head
around the door. He had my face. I woke. You were not there."
952,H,Ciaran Carson,"The Powers-that-Be decreed that from the—of—the sausage rolls, for reasons
Of security, would be contracted to a different firm. They gave the prisoners no reasons.
 
The prisoners complained. We cannot reproduce his actual words here, since their spokesman is alleged
To be a sub-commander of a movement deemed to be illegal.
 
An actor spoke for him in almost-perfect lip-synch: It’s not the quality
 We’re giving off about. Just that it seems they’re getting smaller. We’re talking quantity. 
 
His ‘Belfast’ accent wasn’t West enough. Is the H in H-Block aitch or haitch?
Does it matter? What we have we hold? Our day will come? Give or take an inch?
 
Well, give an inch and someone takes an effing mile. Everything is in the ways
You say them. Like, the prison that we call Long Kesh is to the Powers-that-Be The Maze."
953,[In the very night of movement where I],E. Tracy Grinnell,"In the very night of movement where I
sought a sequential self –
The sea as blood, thought as
Earth that changes the sea
 
Changes the fishes in it

954,"Kaymakamlar Gezi Evi, Selamlik Odasi",Sasha Steensen,"This is the room.
Where mole guests are welcomed.
At this moment you see the wedding table prepared for the mole guests.
 
Rooms are heated with stoves.
Rooms have been designed according to the patriarchal way of living.
The family has, consists of, father, mather, sons and brides.
There is no sex discrimination within the family.
They artogether, have meal and altogether chat, but when the doors are clased.
 
Mole guests are welcomed in “Selamlik” part.
Femole guests are welcomed in “Harem” part.
On such occasions mole guests are served via the cupboard in the wall
               which turns on its axis."
955,Labuntur et Imputantur,Ciaran Carson,"It was overcast. No hour at all was indicated by the gnomon.
With difficulty I made out the slogan, Time and tide wait for no man.
 
I had been waiting for you, Daphne, underneath the dripping laurels, near
The sundial glade where first we met. I felt like Hamlet on the parapets of Elsinore,
 
Alerted to the ectoplasmic moment, when Luna rends her shroud of cloud
And sails into a starry archipelago. Then your revenant appeared and spake aloud:
 
 I am not who you think I am. For what we used to be is gone. The moment’s over, 
 Whatever years you thought we spent together. You don’t know the story. And moreover, 
  
 You mistook the drinking-fountain for a sundial. I put my lips to its whatever,
And with difficulty I made out the slogan, Drink from me and you shall live forever."
956,The New Estate,Ciaran Carson,"Forget the corncrake’s elegy. Rusty
Iambics that escaped your discipline
Of shorn lawns, it is sustained by nature.
It does not grieve for you, nor for itself.
You remember the rolled gold of cornfields,
Their rustling of tinsel in the wind,
A whole field quivering like blown silk?
 
A shiver now runs through the laurel hedge,
And washing flutters like the swaying lines
Of a new verse. The high fidelity
Music of the newly-wed obscures your
Dedication to a life of loving
Money. What could they be for, those marble
Toilet fixtures, the silence of water-beds,
That book of poems you bought yesterday?"
957,Palinode,Sasha Steensen,"O dove, fly to Aleppo with my Byzantine ode
And take my greeting to my kinsman.  
                                                –Mahmoud Darwish

Before I was born, I saw a tissue of ingenious detours, an inextricable tangle

wreathed with mistake.

 

Perhaps the ghost does not limp away, but rather forests flee me, frightened.

Look, they are setting a place for loss, clearing the table for the first glow of

antiquity.

 

Here we see William T. Walters in his little library illuminated, carefully

smoothing the lip of the continent.

 

What form bounds forward from behind but The Atlantic Railroad Coastline Co.?

The whole Roman Empire was sold by ascending auction in 193 A.D.

 

A globe enclosed. Bottomless years. The train has stopped on the platform and no

one is there, for these are the Public Days, when the “Poor Association” claims the

museum’s building.

 

As if bound by the knots of invention, I found a wrong road dotted with weeds

and sorrows."

959,The Story of Madame Chevalier,Ciaran Carson,"You remember the Incredible Shrinking Man? I said.
Well, last night I dreamed I was him. It began the same way.
 
The shirt cuffs were the first thing that came to my attention,
drooping down over my knuckles in the bedroom mirror.      
 
And my waistband and shoes were getting looser by the day.
Within weeks you could perch me on your knee like a male doll.
 
Later you would put me to bed in the empty matchbox.
You failed to watch for the spider that came to explore me.
 
I fought her with a darning needle, a button my shield.
She retreated from me on a thread. I followed her down
 
to the cellar. How I made my way back I’ll never know.
It took me days to travel over the quilt to your hand.
 
No longer a hand but an Alpine range of sleeping flesh.
I crawled into an open pore and entered your bloodstream."

961,An Apology For Her Poetry,Duchess of Newcastle Margaret Cavendish,"I language want to dress my fancies in, 
The hair's uncurled, the garment's loose and thin.
Had they but silver lace to make them gay,
They'd be more courted than in poor array; 
Or, had they art, would make a better show;
But they are plain; yet cleanly do they go.
The world in bravery doth take delight,
And glistering shows do more attract the sight: 
And every one doth honor a rich hood,
As if the outside made the inside good.
And every one doth bow and give the place, 
Not for the man's sake but the silver lace.
Let me intreat in my poor book's behalf,
That all will not adore the golden calf.
Consider, pray, gold hath no life therein,
And life, in nature, is the richest thing.
Be just, let Fancy have the upper place,
And then my verses may perchance find grace."
962,An Epilogue to the Above,Duchess of Newcastle Margaret Cavendish,"Sir Charles into my chamber coming in,
When I was writing of my ‘Fairy Queen;’
‘I pray’—said he—‘when Queen Mab you do see
Present my service to her Majesty:
And tell her I have heard Fame's loud report
Both of her beauty and her stately court.’
When I Queen Mab within my fancy viewed,
My thoughts bowed low, fearing I should be rude;
Kissing her garment thin which fancy made,
I knelt upon a thought, like one that prayed; 
And then, in whispers soft, I did present
His humble service which in mirth was sent;
Thus by imagination I have been
In Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen."
963,[Deeply repentant of my sinful ways],Gaspara Stampa,"Deeply repentant of my sinful ways
And of my trivial, manifold desires,
Of squandering, alas, these few brief days
Of fugitive life in tending love's vain fires,
To Thee, Lord, Who dost move hard hearts again,
And render warmth unto the frozen snow,
And lighten every bitter load of pain
For those who with Thy sacred ardours glow,
   To Thee I turn, O stretch forth Thy right hand
And from this whirlpool rescue me, for I
Without Thine aid could never reach the land;
O willingly for us didst suffer loss,
And to redeem mankind hung on the Cross,
O gentle Saviour, leave me not to die."

Whose brain is fresh and pleasant as the Spring,
Where Fancies grow and where the Muses sing. 
There oft I lean my head, and listening, hark,
To catch his words and all his fancies mark:
And from that garden show of beauties take
Whereof a posy I in verse may make. 
Thus I, that have no gardens of my own,
There gather flowers that are newly blown."
965,"[Ladies, who of my lord would fain be told]",Gaspara Stampa,"Ladies, who of my lord would fain be told,
Picture a gentle knight, full sweet to see,
Though young in years, in wisdom passing old,
Model of glory and of valiancy;
Fair-haired, bright colour glowing in his face,
Tall and well-set, broad-shouldered, finally,
In all his parts a paragon of grace
Except in loving wantonly, ah me!
   Who'd know myself, picture a woman wrought
In passion and in presence after pain's
And death's own bitter images, a port
Of safety where untroubled rest remains;
One who with neither tears, nor sighs, nor zest
Wakes pity in her cruel lover's breast."
966,A Lady Dressed By Youth,Duchess of Newcastle Margaret Cavendish,"Her hair was curls of Pleasure and Delight,
Which on her brow did cast a glistening light.
As lace her bashful eyelids downward hung:
A modest countenance o'er her face was flung:
Blushes, as coral beads, she strung to wear
About her neck, and pendants for each ear:
Her gown was by Proportion cut and made,
With veins embroidered, with complexion laid,
Rich jewels of pure honor she did wear, 
By noble actions brightened everywhere:
Thus dressed, to Fame's great court straightways she went,
To dance a brawl with Youth, Love, Mirth, Content."
967,Man's Short Life and Foolish Ambition,Duchess of Newcastle Margaret Cavendish,"In gardens sweet each flower mark did I,
How they did spring, bud, blow, wither and die.

With that, contemplating of man's short stay,
Saw man like to those flowers pass away.

Yet built he houses, thick and strong and high,
As if he'd live to all Eternity.

Hoards up a mass of wealth, yet cannot fill
His empty mind, but covet will he still.

To gain or keep, such falsehood will he use!
Wrong, right or truth—no base ways will refuse.

I would not blame him could he death out keep,
Or ease his pains or be secure of sleep:

Or buy Heaven's mansions—like the gods become,
And with his gold rule stars and moon and sun:

Command the winds to blow, seas to obey,
Level their waves and make their breezes stay.

But he no power hath unless to die,
And care in life is only misery.

This care is but a word, an empty sound,
Wherein there is no soul nor substance found; 

Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit, 
And all he has he leaves unto this spirit.

To get this Child of Fame and this bare word,
He fears no dangers, neither fire nor sword: 

All horrid pains and death he will endure,
Or any thing can he but fame procure. 

O man, O man, what high ambition grows
Within his brain, and yet how low he goes!

To be contented only with a sound,
Wherein is neither peace nor life nor body found."
968,Chiller Pansies,Debra Wierenga,"Your pansies died again today.
All June I’ve watched them scorch and fall
by noon, their faces folding down
to tissue-paper triangles.
I bring them back with water, words,
a pinch, but they are sick to death
of resurrection. You planted them
last fall, these “Chillers” guaranteed
to come again in spring. They returned
in April—you did not. You who said
 pick all you want, it just makes more!
one day in 1963,
and I, a daughter raised on love
and miracles, believed it."
969,Loving the Hands,Julie Suk,"I could make a wardrobe
with tufts of wool
caught on thistle and bracken.

Lost—the scraps
I might have woven whole cloth.

 Come watch, the man says,
shearing sheep
with the precision of long practice,
fleece, removed all of a piece,
rolled in a neat bundle.

I’ve been so clumsy
with people who’ve loved me.

Straddling a ewe,
the man props its head on his foot,
leans down with clippers,
each pass across the coat a caress.

His dogs, lying nearby,
tremble at every move—as I do,
loving the hands that have learned
to gentle the life beneath them."
970,The Silver Fish,Shawn Pittard,"I killed a great silver fish,
cut him open with a long

thin knife. The river carried
his heart away. I took his

dead eyes home. His red flesh
sang to me on the fire I built

in my backyard. His taste
was the lost memory of my

wildness. Behind amber clouds
of cedar smoke, Orion

drew his bow. A black moon rose
from the night’s dark waters,

a sliver of its bright face
reflecting back into the universe."
971,Snapshot,Linda Parsons,"My mother sends the baby pictures she promised—
egg hunting in Shelby Park, wooden blocks
and Thumbelina tossed on the rug, knotty pine
walls in a house lost to memory. I separate out
the early ones, studying my navel or crumbs
on the tray, taken before my awareness
of Sylvania Superflash. Here I am sitting
on the dinette table, the near birthday cake
striking me dumb. Two places of wedding china,
two glasses of milk, posed for the marvelous
moment: the child squishes the fluted rosettes,
mother claps her hands, father snaps the picture
in the face of time. When the sticky sweet
is washed off the page, we are pasted in an album
of blessed amnesia. The father leaves the pine house
and sees the child on weekends, the mother
stores the china on the top shelf until it’s dull and crazed,
the saucer-eyed girl grips her curved spoon
like there’s no tomorrow."
972,Zippo,Judith Slater,"I didn’t think handsome then, I thought
 my father the way he saunters down Main Street,
housewives, shopkeepers, mechanics calling out,
children running up to get Lifesavers. The way
he pauses to chat, flipping his lighter open,
tamping the Lucky Strike on his thumbnail.

I sneak into his den when he’s out, tuck
into the kneehole of his desk and sniff
his Zippo until dizzy, emboldened;
then play little tricks, mixing red and black
inks in his fountain pen, twisting together
paperclips. If I lift the telephone receiver

quietly, I can listen in on our party line.
That’s how I hear two women
talking about him. That’s why my mother
finds me that night sleepwalking, sobbing.
“It’s all right,” she tells me,
“you had a nightmare, come to bed.”"
973,Cool Dust,Aaron Shurin,"A heave of afternoon light pulls a tulip from the turf, a bower for locusts, a cup of shells. The farmhouse tilts, a bent shadow on wheels. In cedar rooms a family is molded, silent, wrapped in the wire of steel eyes and stopped voice, romantic ash. This is not my house, my ghost, my uninvited guest, my lost labor of love, my thicket or grease, my JPEG gessoed or rawhide suit. The yellow light throbs like an internal organ — soft body of an overture to insect sounds — sapling of a new world — whose future awaits me at the tilting window of my own domestic hut. Perhaps this is my mesh of hours, my muscular ache, my guardian sash, twist of rope carved around an old maple trunk, my rod of power red with anticipatory friction at the edge of an emerging set of planetary rings. Stained ochre by the air I pitch forward, a vanilla-scented pear that floats or falls. In the rattan chair on the front porch by the blistered boards of the front door a figure of tar watches. Cool dust sparkles and settles. Shadows have made me visible. An empty wagon flares on the hillside."
974,Nobaude,Julian Talamantez Brolaski,"I left you last evening without the usual privileges. A lot of what my body was was toxin, that held me aloft in idle price, far from the witless wood and Arcadia. There’s no more moon for birds to buss at over streetlamps. Urchins make their way in the mist, trolling for dinner rolls. How frugal my recent times were spent, the clocks keeping how stoned a content. There’ll be much better dawns than this forthcoming.


 


Now—silver morning, body trussed across a sphere—what would Salome do? 
A certain Grace is coming toward you and xe is lovely. 
The troposphere might solder the iron we sought here, the sky is neither an abaude.


 


What Portia lacks is not anatomical, but philosophical: ‘bitter is my sustenance, melancholy my food, sorry my wine.’ Expressive geometrics of the New York sissy—and with such a disfunctional phone! Portia tells her students get thee to a muhfuckery, where I’ll lay thee fool across my lap.


 


P meets Sally’s longings, her shoes untied, and everything about her demonstrating a careless desolation, a blue eye and sunken. 
Take one step further and the Grace coming toward you is Beauty. The Grace turned away from you is Restraint.
 Hassan pleading for her life, fainting, having a bucket of water thrown on her, reviving.


 


Nothing but a farce, we animate Wall and Moon. The art is cruxy to the love-juice. Once there was many a sight, but now they are wilting, poor lambs. Once a malapert downpour, uncharacteristic of the rains of this place. Next football, a hemistich. The belle lettrist’s idea of a billet-doux, the scientist’s idea of a sauna.


 


What with their consummate barbeque wines, their tawdry dance moves, their go-go girls of yesteryear—we thought the Impressionists were trying to impress people. Fez—an impossibility the universe grew out of. Flaubert saying, Madame Bovary, c’est moi. Loeretta casting her lots."
975,Plume,Aaron Shurin,"Transfixed to the, by the, on the congruities, who is herself a vanishing point coming to closure — dusky flutter — trilling away like a watchdog on drugged sop, channeling her mother and grandmother who’ve engraved on her locket phrases in script: “glide on a blade” and “rustling precedes the shuck.” This is not my teeming fate, my rind, my roiling ellipsis or valedictory spray of myrrh. Always it’s morning, afternoon or evening — the loot of hours — a magic sack grasping vacuum but heavy in the hand, and from which, together, we pull a swarm of telepathic bees, melons beached in a green bin, a lithograph of the city from its crumbling ramparts, crackled pitchers and the mouth of a cave. Perhaps this is my open weave, my phantom rialto or plume of light. We bow to each other in the mash of flickering things. We are completely surrounded."
976,Sloughing Off the Gentlemanly Sports,Julian Talamantez Brolaski,"What makes that fox so grabby for the stars,
Begging like boys do? I meant to fully
Gild that lily, till less like virile Mars
It’s clepd the pansiest of pansy,
The caducous calyx of a poppy.
Cuz, step into these arms where you belong
A coup at the prospect of this lording,
A gleam in the gloom with serpentine song—
The phosphorescent tide’s mine to lavish upon.
 
O stop me at the very vestibule—
Before whom, and in what habit I speak
I watched them use their meat to call me fool.
Someone’s cage is aching at the seams,
The noisome idle falls to dirty dreams—
Thus the flummoxed drunk of xem will coil
And I’ll learn the real, or it’ll learn me,
Making free with the Italian model
The single summer shower mano à mano.
 
The proverbial number of angels
That could’ve fit on the head of a pin
Are crying to the myriad angles,
This glassy labyrinth we happened in
Will not undo the errancer I’ve been.
Soon the swancrest, the feedcrest, my distress
Will feign to fuck the furlonged mannequin—
At what—punishing pace we undress
This crapshoot idée fixe and its yahoo mistress.
 
Fictive trees harsh the billow of my cape,
All kind of lovers crashed rubbernecking.
The fishes on the frontispiece were draped
In your leafy worded velocity.
You whisper, London has no more fog for me
To whit, my darksome peachpit! storms above
—A buckler to them that walks uprightly—
Will not enforce this porno hand from glove
Or diminish one jott my vegetable love."
977,Then,Aaron Shurin,"Once we were in the loop . . . slick with information and the luster of good timing. We folded our clothes. Once we stood up before the standing vigils, before the popping vats, before the annotated lists of marshaled forces with their Venn diagrams like anxious zygotes, their paratactic chasms . . . before the set of whirligig blades, modular torrent. We folded our clothes. Once we remembered to get up to pee . . . and how to pee in a gleaming bowl . . . soaked as we were in gin and coconut, licorice water with catalpa buds, golden beet syrup in Johnny Walker Blue and a beautiful blur like August fog, cantilevered over the headlands . . . We tucked into the crevices of the mattress pad twirling our auburn braids, or woke up at the nick of light and practiced folding our clothes. Our pod printed headbands with hourly updates, announcing the traversals of green-shouldered hawks through the downtown loop, of gillyfish threading the north canals, of the discovery of electron calligraphy or a new method of washing brine. We smoothed our feathers like birds do, and twitched ourselves into warm heaps, and followed the fourth hand on the platinum clocks sweeping in arcs from left to right, up and down, in and out . . . We were steeped in watchfulness, fully suspended, itinerant floaters — ocean of air — among  the ozone lily pads and imbrex domes, the busting thickets of nutmeg, and geode malls. At night we told stories about the future with clairvoyant certainty. Our clothing was spectacular and fit to a T. We admired each other with ferocity."
978,What to Say Upon Being Asked to Be Friends,Julian Talamantez Brolaski,"Why speak of hate, when I do bleed for love?
Not hate, my love, but Love doth bite my tongue
Till I taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough
So flatter I my fever for the one
For whom I inly mourn, though seem to shun.
A rose is arrows is eros, so what
If I confuse the shade that I’ve become
With winedark substance in a lover’s cup?
But stop my tonguely wound, I’ve bled enough.
If I be fair, or false, or freaked with fear
If I my tongue in lockèd box immure
Blame not me, for I am sick with love.
     Yet would I be your friend most willingly
     Since friendship would infect me killingly."
979,To My Mother,Edgar Allan Poe,"Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
The angels, whispering to one another,
Can find, among their burning terms of love,
None so devotional as that of “Mother,”
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—
You who are more than mother unto me,
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother—my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life."
980,And on the Third Day,Andrew Allport,"We called off the search,
and the weary climbed down from the glacier
with their dogs exhausted in the spring sun
too tired to eat the ice in their paws.
 
We had called his name, mostly for show,
a ritual that kept us moving: in the high bowls,
their stunted pines predating the flood,
in the steep ravines sliding loose with scree,
loudly at first, then speaking it to each other
then spelling it out on forms required by law.
 
It is a form of praying, he claimed, to walk
out to the very edge of your life. Every time
the reply comes clear as a stone
at our thin crowns. It misses
almost every time, humming as it goes."
981,A Bed above the Abyss: Amnesiac Notebook,Andrew Allport,"i. Awake
 
Each entry consisting of the statements
 I am awake or I am conscious
entered every few minutes:
 
       2:10 p.m.: this time properly awake.
       2:14 p.m.: this time finally awake.
       2:35 p.m.: this time completely awake.
 
      At 9:40 p.m. I awoke for the first time, despite my previous claims.
 
This in turn was crossed out, followed by:
 
     I was fully conscious at 10:35 p.m., and awake for the first time
                  in many, many weeks.
 
This in turn was cancelled out by the next entry.
 
 
 ii. Passport
 
How large it grew, that first kiss, until I could board it each night,
a raft drifting out into the quiet lake. After twenty years
the great amnesiac HM never recognized
his doctor, and after lunch
gladly ate another: Time for lunch, they would tell him again.
You must be starving.
 
God, I am starving.
Without a body, collection cannot precede
recollection: recollect a tongue, that skilled swirl
of its quick tip, a mouthful of familiars: smoke,
strawberry candy. Memory in the web
between dumbstruck and dura: dump and dune,
duplicates. What kind of game is this?
 
I’m no longer a boy,
HM would say to his reflection, the surprise on his face
genuine. What kind of game is this?
The mirror a passport like any other, its picture
out of time, a foreign shock of untamed hair
even the photographer declared beautiful then.
 
 Then: the word smiles
like a stranger on your first day at school,
sitting on stone steps, worn with use.
 
 
 iii. Taxonomy
 
“Red but not bird comes to mind.”
                 Only the kingdom of living names
 
was missing there—bank, flagstone, sofa
                 remained, but not the blur at the feeder,
 
the undersea creature on the card—
                  it’s a danger, a killer swimmer,
 
they coaxed him—it’s called a
                  (waiting for the word to stir from its depth;
 
how could he forget the ones who dressed,
                  fed, taught him word by word
 
the order of the world? What noise does
                  that loss make?) (They looked suspiciously
 
like his parents, he thought: strangers posing
                  unanswerable questions)—
 
“It has no name, it has no need.”"
982,Fourth of July,John Brehm,"Freedom is a rocket,
isn’t it, bursting
orgasmically over
parkloads of hot
dog devouring
human beings
or into the cities
of our enemies
without whom we
would surely
kill ourselves
though they are
ourselves and
America I see now
is the soldier
who said I saw
something
burning on my
chest and tried
to brush it off with
my right hand
but my arm
wasn’t there—
America is no
other than this
moment, the
burning ribcage,
the hand gone
that might have
put it out, the skies
afire with our history."
983,Late Summer,Jennifer Grotz,"Before the moths have even appeared
to orbit around them, the streetlamps come on,
a long row of them glowing uselessly
 
along the ring of garden that circles the city center,
where your steps count down the dulling of daylight.
At your feet, a bee crawls in small circles like a toy unwinding.
 
Summer specializes in time, slows it down almost to dream.
And the noisy day goes so quiet you can hear
the bedraggled man who visits each trash receptacle
 
mutter in disbelief: Everything in the world is being thrown away!
Summer lingers, but it’s about ending. It’s about how things
redden and ripen and burst and come down. It’s when
 
city workers cut down trees, demolishing
one limb at a time, spilling the crumbs
of twigs and leaves all over the tablecloth of street.
 
 Sunglasses! the man softly exclaims
while beside him blooms a large gray rose of pigeons
huddled around a dropped piece of bread."
984,The Ocracoke Ponies,Jennifer Grotz,"No one saw the first ones
swim ashore centuries ago,
nudged by waves into the marsh grasses.
 
When you look into their faces, there is no trace
of the ship seized with terror, the crashing waves
and the horses’ cries when thrown overboard.
 
Every afternoon you ride your bicycle to the pasture
to watch the twitch of their manes and ivory tails
unroll a carpet of silence, to see ponies lost in dream.
 
But it isn’t dream, that place
your mind drifts to, that museum of memory
inventoried in opposition to the present.
 
You felt it once on a plane,
taking off from a city you didn’t want to leave,
the stranded moment when the plane lifts into the clouds.
 
That’s not dream, it’s not even sleeping.
It is the nature of sleeping to be unaware.
This was some kind of waiting for the world to come back."
985,Patterns for Arans,Linda Norton,"We could paint semi-darkness in semi-darkness. And the ‘right lighting’ of a picture could be semi-darkness. 
                                                            Wittgenstein
                                                            from Remarks on Color

These islands lie off the west coast of Ireland
as if nothing matters.
The people have lived here for centuries
with only a thin covering of soil over the surface.
Great use is made of the seaweed,
the cattle swimming out.
 
The women here are justly famous.
They weave their own tweed
and make a type of belt called criss.
The heavy Atlantic seas,
the slip stitch.
The difficulty of the patterns
are never written down.
 
Most impressive and rich, the trellis pattern
and the rope, the tribute to the hardworking bee.
But sometimes their knitting shows mistakes,
with a true Irish touch of nothing
really matters, a careless nonchalance
of the crossing of their cables.
 
And note mistakes in the simple patterns:
forked lightning or cliff paths,
small fields fenced with stone,
the ups and downs of married life,
the mosses.
 
The openwork has a religious
significance or none.
Sometimes the clarity of the pattern is
lost through the use of
very fine wool.
 
Green from the mosses, brown
from the seaweed, grey and cream
color from the stones and pebbles:
many are distinctly over-bobbled.
No matter. They are too lovely
to be lost. Wool and knitting
leaflets can be obtained.
 
In no case is the whole pattern given.
There are certain gaps and yawns
and part of the pattern is left out
as if it doesn’t matter,
or was too lovely,
so was lost.
 
Some of the simple patterns
are charming for children’s jerseys.
This one, for example,
would be lovely on a child."
986,Self Portrait as a Meadow,Linda Norton,"There is a chair
the heart of which
is wooden
split five ways
and grass pressed flat
where we kissed
where others later kissed
on the same mattress
and solemn nothing
happening under a canopy—
 
Have you forgotten me?
 
I will go down wonderfully
as was told in proverbs
though for a long time I thought
I should not go.
 
Here are things that have
no Latin names
or none
that men would know."
987,The Window at Night,Jennifer Grotz,"Eyes wide like an owl’s, an aspirin-pale face
foretells in lamplight how it accumulates age.
Somewhat masked, somewhat naked, there’s no way
to know what others see when looking at it.
All five of the body’s senses crowd
on this small planet a weather of hair surrounds.
 
My face is not a democracy—the eyes are tyrants
and the ears are radical dissenters.
In the conversations of eyebrows, mine are whispers.
Like the window at night, the face reflects too,
uncertain how to change when greeting itself
(and is it not cruel when another’s face
won’t reflect acknowledgment of you?).
 
My mother, my father, and my brother are found
in the blurring of feature and expression.
Cynicism finds no purchase here;
the same cannot be said for sadness
(and look deeper—anger hides in the jaw).
And while the nose quietly broods
like an actor rehearsing his soliloquy,
the empty page of the forehead, when I raise my brows,
fills suddenly with questions."

I

 

Hard dreams. The moment at which you recognize that your own death lies

in wait somewhere within your body. A lone ship defines the horizon. The

rain is not safe to drink.

 

In Grozny, in Bihac, the idea of history shudders with each new explosion.

The rose lies unattended, wild thorns at the edge of a mass grave. Between

classes, over strong coffee, young men argue the value of a pronoun.

 

When this you see, remember. Note in a bottle bobs in a cartoon sea. The

radio operator’s name is Sparks.

 

Hand outlined in paint on a brick wall. Storm turns playground into a

swamp. Finally we spot the wood duck on the middle lake.

 

The dashboard of my car like the keyboard of a piano. Toy animals anywhere.

 

Sun swells in the morning sky.

 

Man with three pens clipped to the neck of his sweatshirt shuffles from one

table to the next, seeking distance from the cold January air out the coffee

house door, tall Styrofoam cup in one hand, Of Grammatology in the other.

Outside, a dog is tied to any empty bench, bike chained to the No Parking

sign."
989,"You, part XII",Ron Silliman,"for Pat Silliman

XII

 

A guide to the sky under full nondisclosure.

 

Dawn in the bare birch trees, the sun, swollen, throbs over the horizon. Hotel

buffet doodah. Two dogs dancing, sniffing one another’s genitalia.

 

One can hear the electricity wired in the walls, water rushing through the

pipes, the boards and joints of the old house groaning as they settle.

 

Map of morning. Winter light. One’s experience of the transfer point air-

port as that of the city itself. Dear winter, it’s 5:15 AM. Shoes for Mickey

Mouse.

 

Waste deep in the big muddy. The sound of rain around. The line (not visible)

binds letters into words. People are drowning.

 

Moon, broken in the middle. What a watch watches. Song of the single en-

gine Cessna, threading the pre-dawn sky. One bird, one bird, many.

 

Blades of grass brittle in the freeze. Spider’s corner of the bath room. One

maple tree that will not return to life."
990,Ace,Cally Conan-Davies,"Bloody hell, the world’s turned 
upside down

the flame tree has become
geranium

my coral bed has grown
into a tree

the hummingbird you hammered
to the wall

though tin, could any moment
turn and flee.

The yellow sky has gone
all roundabout

and clover threes where
seaweed used to be

and blood blossoms with fire,
the powers below grow higher —
if things turn right-way-up
will the falling fire stop?

The wave is in the hill
the nest abandons me
and all the reddened earth is still 

igniting"
991,And,Rae Armantrout,"1

Tense and tenuous
grow from the same root

as does tender
in its several guises:

the sour grass flower;
the yellow moth.

I would not confuse
the bogus
with the spurious.

The bogus
is a sore thumb

while the spurious

992,A Bowl of Spaghetti,Kimiko Hahn,"“To find a connectome, or the mental makeup of a person,”
researchers experimented with the neurons of a worm

then upgraded to mouse hoping 
“to unravel the millions of miles of wire in the [human] brain”

that they liken to “untangling a bowl of spaghetti”

of which I have an old photo: Rei in her high chair delicately
picking out each strand to mash in her mouth.

Was she two? Was that sailor dress from Mother?
Did I cook from scratch? If so, there was a carrot in the sauce

as Mother instructed and I’ll never forget 
since some strand determines infatuation as a daughter’s fate."
993,A Close Shave,Devin Johnston,"From Baden, or what’s left of it,
pursue a long, smooth curve of road
that skirts the northern flood wall
to parallel a palisade
of channel markers sunk in earth,
the folly of a cement works.
Its blank silos overlook
a pit of argillaceous shale,
the fine and fossilized remains
of bivalves, sponges, spines of shark,
quarried and burnt with limestone charge
to alchemize a binder of brick
and the city’s shallow, brittle crust.

Around a bend, the riverbed 
swings wide to open a fetch of field.
Shadows skim its mucky thaw
as juncos, whisked about by the wind
on courses neither fixed nor free,
give but a quick metallic chink.
Behind you, rain has wrapped the bluffs
and scumbled limbs of sycamores.
Ahead, each bend assumes the name
of a gaudy packet run aground,
or snagged and sunk, or blown to bits:
for one, the side-wheel Amazon,
pluperfect wheelhouse painted green,
that struck a honey-locust pike
still rooted deep in river mud
and tore its hull from stem to stern.
Down in minutes! Within the month
an island silted up behind.

A flock of luggage floated south, 
remarked by those on Water Street
loafing before the trading post
and the barbershop of Madame Krull.
She can eternally be found
at work in her elaborate room
toujours prêt to clip and coif
or wield her razor with great skill
for those who favor her with their chins.
The scent of ginger tonic blends
with that of borscht, its acrid tang,
consumed behind a wooden screen
as Illinois grows dark. In this,
her second year since coming west."
994,Crystal Meth Under Her Choir Robe,John Repp,"No surprise. Bills to pay, pain to obliterate,

995,The Day the Beekeeper Died: Sulaymaniyah,David Sullivan,"His daughter pulls on
            her father’s frayed dishdasha
                                     to go check the bees.
 

Today she doesn’t
            carry the smoke canister
                                    with her to the field.
 

She opens a tray
            while talking down their high whine,
                                    breaks off honeycomb
 

and rubs it over
            her face and hair, over white
                                    cloth, down to her feet.
 

Each of her hands holds
            the crumbling comb like a sponge
                                    while she waits for them.
 

When the first one comes
            she feels wings against her toes,
                                    a tongue unscrolling.
 

She wills herself not
            to laugh as the next alights
                                    on her neck, tickling
 

her hairs as it walks.
            Then they descend to shoulders,
                                    forearms, chest, thighs, eyes
 

she shuts—she feels the
            thousand tongues on the cloth.
                                    Feather-like wings churn
 

in her ears, rustle
            and hum with agitated talk.
                                    Never been so loved.
 

Her father’s alive,
            she’s a torch of burning bees,
                                    tears course across cheeks.
 

When her mother sees
            the apparition of bees
                                    walking towards their door
 

she falls on her knees.
            It is the end of the world.
                                    But when the angel
 

speaks with her daughter’s
            voice she’s not amazed. Mama,
                                    how do I end this?
 

Her mother brushes
            bees away from her eyes, pulls
                                    them from her hair and
 

undresses her child,
            hanging the winged dishdasha
                                    on the clothes line.
 

Carries her naked
            girl into the house to bathe.
                                    The bee-like angels
 

take all day to strip
            honey from the robe, return

Anything that blooms that long
will seem inanimate. Heaven. Grief
            like the sea. Keeps going. Over the same wrought
ground. The whole spent moan. Praise dies

in my throat or in the spooky rift
            between itself and its intended. Like a wish-
bone breaking. The little crutch inside
is not a toy. There is no night asylum.
            A restless bed, a haunt preserve,
a blanket rough as sailcloth. But sing me, was it kind

            flawed about it? If song goes wrong,

            It is a ferocious thing

Glove over glove, let your dance express

This tune with mountains tied inside
            and many silent letters
can be read as trackers scan the spaces
between toes and birders read the rustle
            left by birds. As any mammal
in its private purr hole knows,
the little crutch inside
            is not a crutch. More a sort of
steeple. Neither silver to be chased

nor gold to be beaten.
            You were==you are
more than ever like that too.
Noon upon noon,
            you customize this solitude
with spires

as everything does when happy."

without the siren along the service road,

Mother’s lipstick, Daughter’s manicure, 

firecrackers, a monkey’s ass, a cherry, Rei’s lost elephant,

sheets on the line.

Never mind how 
mismatched in the heart,
I should be grateful

that childhood stretched 
like fog, the beach empty
and unmarked.

It comes to little now
who I forgive, mourn, 
or thank. The dust shifts 
and we are barely 
suspended in the light. 

I know this little thing:
there’s a boy somewhere 
in a station where 
the trains still run,
wearing scuffed brown shoes, 
gray overcoat, and cap;
someone has neatly parted
and combed his hair. 
He is waiting 
to be taken by the hand
and told where we are going,

ever praises the ass of the peacock,
grin of quills that does the heavy lifting,

or how you eat anything from ants
to Styrofoam, from cheese to chicken.

Road roamer, flower devourer:

1004,New Song,Devin Johnston,"After William IX, Duke of Aquitaine

As sweetness flows through these new days,
the woods leaf out, and songbirds phrase
in neumes of roosted melody
incipits to a new song.
Then love should find lubricity
and quicken, having slept so long.

The bloodroot blossoms, well and good,
but I receive no word that would
set my troubled heart at ease,
nor could we turn our faces toward
the sun, and open by degrees,
unless we reach a clear accord.

And so our love goes, night and day:
it’s like the thorny hawthorn spray
that whips about in a bitter wind
from dusk to dawn, shellacked with sleet,
until the sun’s first rays ascend
through leaves and branches, spreading heat.

I have in mind one April morning
when she relented without warning,
relenting from her cold rebuff
in laughter, peals of happiness.
Sweet Christ, let me live long enough
to get my hands beneath her dress!

I hate the elevated talk
that disregards both root and stalk
and sets insipid pride above
vicissitudes of lust and strife.
Let others claim a higher love:
we’ve got the bread, we’ve got the knife."
1005,One Life,Maria Hummel,"I don’t know when I stopped believing in heaven,
or if I do. Maybe I just stopped receiving heaven.

The sun rose. I climbed into the pines’ brittle
crowns. You could say I was retrieving heaven.

Not a place or a time, but blindness to everything 
but one light, pulsing, pleasing: heaven.

We married in September. Everyone was still
wearing their summer shirts, sleeves of heaven.

It was white, there was a bend, and the car 
spun. It was then I prayed, pleading with heaven.

When he goes limp, lie him down on the gurney,
Mom. Oxygen mask, breathing heaven.

The hospital shines, our son flies in and out.
The snow falls hard, relieving heaven.

He loves the colors of planets. I teach him 
their lifelessness: beautiful, deceiving heaven.

I don’t know who is buried beneath me
but I hear her break as I am leaving heaven.

How can you cry for one ruined life, Maria,
when you could be grieving for heaven?"
1006,Pencil,Marianne Boruch,"My drawing teacher said: Look, think, make a mark.
Look, I told myself.
And waited to be marked.

Clouds are white but they darken
with rain. Even a child blurs them back
to little woolies on a hillside, little
bundles without legs. Look, my teacher
would surely tell me, they’re nothing

like that. Like that: the lie. Like that: the poem.
She said: Respond to the heaviest part
of the figure first. Density is 
form. That I keep hearing destiny

is not a mark of character. Like pilgrimage 
once morphed to mirage in a noisy room, someone 
so earnest at my ear. Then marriage slid.
Mir-aage, Mir-aage, I heard the famous poet let loose 
awry into her microphone, triumphant.

The figure to be drawn —
not even half my age. She’s completely 
emptied her face for this job of standing still an hour. 
Look. Okay. But the little

dream in there, inside the think
that comes next. A pencil in my hand, its secret life 
is charcoal, the wood already burnt,
a sacrifice."
1007,Postcard 2,Franz Wright,"Incomprehensible fate that sentenced my father to my mother. I can’t blame him, I would have left the raving bitch myself, and would do so many many times in years to come. Then, of course, I came along. There is a limit to what one man can endure. So I suppose I am the reason he left, actually. I am the one to blame. And yet he did his best; he did all that he was capable of doing, and wrote me every year, like clockwork. He rarely remembered to mail what he wrote me, poor man (when I think of what I must have put him through), barely legible one-sentence postcards he sometimes worked at half the night; but as they all said the same thing, word for word, it wasn’t that bad. He could be forgiven. 
The blizzard I visit your city disguised as will never be over and never arrive
. I think what he was trying to say was that at some point I’d begin to notice I was freezing, wasn’t dressed right, had nowhere to go, and was staggering into a blinding snow that no one else could see. I think he meant, the cold will make you what I am today."
1008,The Prodigal Son,Spencer Reece,"“Fly at once!” he said. “All is discovered.” — Edward Gorey

In Miami, this May afternoon, I look up,
the sky hot, so hot, always, and heating up hotter —
how long I have loved this scene.
The clouds are white optimistic churches; 
I cannot number them.
Herons, pelicans, and gulls glide like dreams 
through cloud-portals, cloud-porticos, and cloud-porte-cochères 
Giotto could have done with his passion for blues and dimensions.
Hard not to love a place always called by possibility.
Nearby, Cuba is singing and somewhere here
Richard Blanco is writing his poems. 
As I enter the city,
my bishop walks with a cane towards our cathedral.

The sun shines on the people 
and unites us in a delirium of light.
High above this bleached, scorched, fragile, groin-scented peninsula, 
the birds track their insects and remain loyal to their nests.
I look up and I feel bliss building 
as I did when my father read another book to me, 
and another, the pages like wings.
There are moments of memorable patience in this world.
Airplanes advance towards Miami International,
booked with Jewish retirees and Cuban émigrés—
their descending engines disrupt the white-gloved illegal waiters
at the country clubs in Coral Gables, who deliver flan
to the ladies who have pulled their skin behind their ears like gum.

This is a place where few decisions are doubted.
On South Beach, 
where everyone rearranges or expands their sexual parts,
there seems to be no life outside the physical and time
becomes a tricky thing here, spring looks like winter,
winter like spring, the scenes dense, shifting, shut —
and before you know it the rats have preached from the mangoes
and then chewed them to corpses. 
And look, how the interior decorators
unroll their fresh bolts and wink-wink to new clients —
what would be considered frivolous anywhere else
is here pondered and coerced at great length.
The feminine gains strength.

Moving closer to the cathedral,
the sea presses the harbor, wanting to be loved,
pushing up the cruise ships with its muscles.
The sea says: “I am the sea.”
We have seen Cubans come atop dolphins’ backs here.
Mothers have drowned for their sons,
but the cool gray backs of the dolphins have buoyed their children to us,
numbed by the lullaby of sonar clicks.
The sea blesses the city the way mothers do —
forceful, pushy, ungraspable, persistent.
The black mangrove shoots take root on the porous, chalky rock,
building themselves up like steeples. Listen.
How the waves love what does not love them back.
Pedicurists buff the toenails of the sugar daddies in the Delano.
Lincoln Road refines its scarlet seductions.
Bees are sticky with tourism inside the motel rooms of the rose.
Red-orange petals from the Royal Poincianas tint the minutes
with flamboyance. The pink and white bottlebrush trees explode
with seeds. I will always love my time in this city, you might say
craziest of cities, delivering its youth in short-shorts
and Rollerblades with rainbow sweatbands.
City smelling of unzipped things. Cha cha cha! Cha cha cha!
I do not think the city will ever be mine. 
Beautiful Spanish and broken English spoken everywhere. 
How I love that sound,
for it is the sound of people making their way where they were not born.
Maids from Honduras push their carts,
stacking their wrapped soaps, counting them like children,
their cuticles sting with disinfectant,
perspiration staining their uniforms as they pray over the toilet seats they clean.

O Miami!
For a decade I did not speak to my parents.
Are you listening to me? I will not bore you with details.
Instead, I will tell you something new. Listen to me.
I was angry. But the reasons no longer interest me.
I take the liberty of assuming you approve of forgiveness,
stressing hardening gentleness as you do.
I speak to the bishop about my call and the sacraments,
we discuss blessings, absolutions, consecrations—
our work of the soul. The soul has no sex and I am relieved
to speak of a thing alive in the world that has no sex.

The bishop places a paperweight atop my reports on his desk,
our professional talk is measured by the silence of the dead
who are always flinging open their shutters,
religion being the work of the living and the dead,
the hope and release in the hearts of parents turning to their children
and the hearts of children turning to their parents —
all that business in life that remains unrehearsed.
Superior to obedient, we pray. 
The laughter of the bathers
through the grillwork of the office window pleases me,
their movements rinsed in the baptism of the sea, the languorous sea.

The sky at the end of the city trembles.
Light and dust warm to cream to pink to lavender.
Miami, it has been a gorgeous day, indeed. Thank you.
How I love your decks, bridges, promenades, and balconies —
the paraphernalia of connection.
How fast the pastels encroach upon the edges.
I have a dinner engagement in Coral Gables at Books & Books
where I will see the poet Richard Blanco.
I hope he will tell me stories of his beloved, broken Cuba.
Nearly five o’clock now, and I am late.
When I arrive, Richard Blanco speaks of Cuba
as I had wished, and the city quiets all around him.
“If our bodies house our souls,” I think to myself,
“Then, Richard, poets are the interior decorators of the mind.”
Richard Blanco is saying something about going back,
his relatives singing poems in the fields. I listen.
Behind us, in the palmetum, 
at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens,
the Elephant, Date, Malaysian, Kiwi, Coconut, and Royal palms
ask the city to remember their names with the insistence of priests.

Good-bye, Miami, good-bye.
Good-bye to the workers laying down the grids of the concrete embeds
on the high-rises, reinforcing their masculine nests,
gluing glass with their spermy compounds to stone and steel.
Good-bye to you, South Beach.
Let your rapturous sands darken to a deep grape color.
Let the polished feet of youth launch into their surprises and swaps. 
Let the elements cool.
Good-bye, Richard Blanco, good-bye.
Today my candidacy for Holy Orders was affirmed.
I listen to the sea flatten.
Cuba pleads in the distance one more night.
Honduras waits on too many things to count.
No longer can I stand still.
Stars smooth the sea with their immaculate highways of long lights.

Mother and father,
forgive me my absence.
I will always be moving quietly toward you."

become the less intelligible I seem to otters.

I know what you mean you said.
It’s like the time I was compelled to speak
on hedonism to the monks and nuns.

Did I say most religion is devotional
expediency? Or religion doesn’t worry about being
religious, its wisdom corrupted by its brilliance as light

passing near the sun is deflected
in its path. Deep in its caprices,
the whole body thinks it’s understood.

To think otterwise is isolating. When I said
hedonism stressed cheerfulness,
there were disappointed groans. Look, I’m sorry

I gave you an ornament shaped like a hollow look.
I liked its trinket brightness. Just don’t give me
a water tower dressed up as a church steeple

or one of those silly thunderstorms
that hang around volcanoes. See how those teardrop lights
make every object jump? The memory does.

You made me love. Was it exile in honey
is still exile? Am I the fire or just another flame?
Please sell me an indulgence, I begged a monk.

And tell me what creature, what peril,
could craft that sound that night
dropped like a nubile sliver in my ear.

There is no freedom of silence
when morture forces us to speak
from organs other than the heart.

It was something about love. A far cry. It was come to me
unmediated, go to god lengths. In great things,
the attempt alone is sufficient. I think this

’cause I’m finite. That’s an understanding
to which reason can only aspire
though an entire speech community labored

for generations to say it in a fair hand clearly
dated and scented with lavender. My one and only only
a crass color orgy will see us through

the dusk ahead, the months gray as donkey.
See how it grows its own cross of fur
and bears it on its back? I showed you that."

You take off your black
motorcycle jacket, hang it
on the back of a chair. It’s cold
from our walk along the sea wall.
Your pockets jingle with shells.
While we were gone, you left
the stove on low—some things
you do make me so nervous.
You graze the surface of sauce
simmering in a pan, shiny fingertip
held out for me to lick, you say
“What does it need?” Maybe nothing,
maybe honey to unbitter the lime.
Later that night you’ll bury your face
in my belly and sob. “I’m sorry,”

freshwater pearls, with seeds. The plumed mask,
the mask with a sutured mouth, a moonface,
with a healed gash that means harvest. A glower
that hides wanting. A grotesque pucker. Here’s
a beaked mask, a braided mask, here’s a mask
without eyes, a mask that looks like a mask
but isn’t—please don’t try to unribbon it.

Lace mask to net escaping thoughts. Pass me

Bird-eyed, the wind watched.
Four deer in a blowsy meadow.
As though it were simply random, a stately stare.

Time that my eye ached, my heart shook, why.
Mistaking lime for lemon.
Dressed in cobalt, charcoal, thistle—and control.
 
If they had more they would need less.
A proposal from the squinting logician.
Seems we are legal, seems we are ill.
Ponderous purpose, are you weather, are you wheel?
 
Gold with a heart of cinder.
Little blue chip dancing in the light of the loom.
Mistress, May-girl, whom will you kiss?
The death of water is the birth of air."
1021,[I believe there is a song that is stranger than wind . . .],Karen Volkman,"I believe there is a song that is stranger than wind, that sips the scald


from the telling, toss, toss. In the room I move in, a wrecked boy listened


to each sky’s erasing, for it was shrill winter, for it was blast and blur.


For it was farther from the native birds and the gray heath heather and


the uncaressable thighs of the one who shook in violet. Those who fly


farthest must always burn the nest. But the mind in its implacable spec-


trum dims to brown. Must you die on your back like a cheap engine, rust


and wrack? In the crevicing days, there are no words for prizing, be-


tween the lidless moon and the silver hands of the fountain. But if it is


space you must fail in, teach it din."
1022,[I never wish to sing again as I used to . . .],Karen Volkman,"I never wish to sing again as I used to, when two new eyes could


always stain the sea, of tangent worlds, indolent as callows, and the clock


went backward for a skip, to rise, to set.


      Some will twine grass to fit in a thimble, some will carve bread to


mend a craggy wall, some in the slantest midnight cry for sleep. When


the pitch-owl swallows the moon, what welt will show it? Sighing helps


nothing, raspberries raw and green, in the form of a heart


      imperfectly divided. A wave grows sharper close to the shore. Some


own words like strips of scape and summon. It is possible to suffer even


in the sun. And race the steep noon to its highest, hoary gate. Stares


drop under the sky; silence of a windslap; and a scar drifts out of air to


stand whistling:


      She who listens poorly will always be calling. She who sounds silence


drowns with the dumb.


      She who cuts her hands off must drink with her tongue."

What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage.        
          Ezra Pound

You’ll find labels describing what is gone:
an empress’s bones, a stolen painting
 
of a man in a feathered helmet
holding a flag-draped spear.
 
A vellum gospel, hidden somewhere long ago
forgotten, would have sat on that pedestal;
 
this glass cabinet could have kept the first
salts carried back from the Levant.
 
To help us comprehend the magnitude
of absence, huge rooms
 
lie empty of their wonders—the Colossus,
Babylon’s Hanging Gardens and
 
in this gallery, empty shelves enough to hold
all the scrolls of Alexandria.
 
My love, I’ve petitioned the curator
who has acquired an empty chest
 
representing all the poems you will
now never write. It will be kept with others
 
in the poet’s gallery. Next door,
a vacant room echoes with the spill
 
of jewels buried by a pirate who died
before disclosing their whereabouts.
 
I hope you don’t mind, but I have kept
a few of your pieces
 
for my private collection. I think
you know the ones I mean."
1024,May,Karen Volkman,"In May’s gaud gown and ruby reckoning
the old saw wind repeats a colder thing.
 
Says, you are the bluest body I ever seen.
Says, dance that skeletal startle the way I might.
 
Radius, ulna, a catalogue of flex.
What do you think you’re grabbing
 
with those gray hands? What do you think
you’re hunting, cat-mouth creeling
 
in the mouseless dawn? Pink as meat
in the butcher’s tender grip, white as
 
the opal of a thigh you smut the lie on.
In May’s red ruse and smattered ravishings
 
you one, you two, you three your cruder schemes,
you blanch black lurk and blood the pallid bone
 
and hum scald need where the body says I am
and the rose sighs Touch me, I am dying
 
in the pleatpetal purring of mouthweathered May."
1025,"Don't You Wonder, Sometimes?",Tracy K. Smith,"1.
 
After dark, stars glisten like ice, and the distance they span
Hides something elemental. Not God, exactly. More like
Some thin-hipped glittering Bowie-being—a Starman
Or cosmic ace hovering, swaying, aching to make us see.
And what would we do, you and I, if we could know for sure
 
That someone was there squinting through the dust,
Saying nothing is lost, that everything lives on waiting only
To be wanted back badly enough? Would you go then,
Even for a few nights, into that other life where you
And that first she loved, blind to the future once, and happy?
 
Would I put on my coat and return to the kitchen where my
Mother and father sit waiting, dinner keeping warm on the stove?
Bowie will never die. Nothing will come for him in his sleep
Or charging through his veins. And he’ll never grow old,
Just like the woman you lost, who will always be dark-haired
 
And flush-faced, running toward an electronic screen
That clocks the minutes, the miles left to go. Just like the life
In which I’m forever a child looking out my window at the night sky
Thinking one day I’ll touch the world with bare hands
Even if it burns.
 
 
          2.
 
He leaves no tracks. Slips past, quick as a cat. That’s Bowie
For you: the Pope of Pop, coy as Christ. Like a play
Within a play, he’s trademarked twice. The hours
 
Plink past like water from a window A/C. We sweat it out,
Teach ourselves to wait. Silently, lazily, collapse happens.
But not for Bowie. He cocks his head, grins that wicked grin.
 
Time never stops, but does it end? And how many lives
Before take-off, before we find ourselves
Beyond ourselves, all glam-glow, all twinkle and gold?
 
The future isn’t what it used to be. Even Bowie thirsts
For something good and cold. Jets blink across the sky
Like migratory souls.
 
 
          3.
 
Bowie is among us. Right here
In New York City. In a baseball cap
And expensive jeans. Ducking into
A deli. Flashing all those teeth
At the doorman on his way back up.
Or he’s hailing a taxi on Lafayette
As the sky clouds over at dusk.
He’s in no rush. Doesn’t feel
The way you’d think he feels.
Doesn’t strut or gloat. Tells jokes.
 
I’ve lived here all these years
And never seen him. Like not knowing
A comet from a shooting star.
But I’ll bet he burns bright,
Dragging a tail of white-hot matter
The way some of us track tissue
Back from the toilet stall. He’s got
The whole world under his foot,
And we are small alongside,
Though there are occasions
 
When a man his size can meet
Your eyes for just a blip of time
And send a thought like SHINE
SHINE SHINE SHINE SHINE
Straight to your mind. Bowie,
I want to believe you. Want to feel
Your will like the wind before rain.
The kind everything simply obeys,
Swept up in that hypnotic dance
As if something with the power to do so
Had looked its way and said:
                                                     Go ahead."
1026,Duende,Tracy K. Smith,"1.
 
The earth is dry and they live wanting.
Each with a small reservoir
Of furious music heavy in the throat.
They drag it out and with nails in their feet
Coax the night into being. Brief believing.
A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies.
And in this night that is not night,
Each word is a wish, each phrase
A shape their bodies ache to fill—
 
            I’m going to braid my hair
        Braid many colors into my hair
             I’ll put a long braid in my hair
        And write your name there
  
They defy gravity to feel tugged back.
The clatter, the mad slap of landing.
 
 
                                    2.
 
And not just them. Not just
The ramshackle family, the tíos,
 Primitos, not just the bailaor
Whose heels have notched
And hammered time
So the hours flow in place
Like a tin river, marking
Only what once was.
Not just the voices of scraping
Against the river, nor the hands
Nudging them farther, fingers
Like blind birds, palms empty,
Echoing. Not just the women
With sober faces and flowers
In their hair, the ones who dance
As though they’re burying
Memory—one last time—
Beneath them.
                        And I hate to do it here.
To set myself heavily beside them.
Not now that they’ve proven
The body a myth, a parable
For what not even language
Moves quickly enough to name.
If I call it pain, and try to touch it
With my hands, my own life,
It lies still and the music thins,
A pulse felt for through garments.
If I lean into the desire it starts from—
If I lean unbuttoned into the blow
Of loss after loss, love tossed
Into the ecstatic void—
It carries me with it farther,
To chords that stretch and bend
Like light through colored glass.
But it races on, toward shadows
Where the world I know
And the world I fear
Threaten to meet.
 
                                    3.
 
There is always a road,
The sea, dark hair, dolor.
  
Always a question
Bigger than itself—
 
            They say you’re leaving Monday             Why can’t you leave on Tuesday?"
1027,I Don't Miss It,Tracy K. Smith,"But sometimes I forget where I am,
Imagine myself inside that life again.
 
Recalcitrant mornings. Sun perhaps,
Or more likely colorless light
 
Filtering its way through shapeless cloud.
 
And when I begin to believe I haven’t left,
The rest comes back. Our couch. My smoke
 
Climbing the walls while the hours fall.
Straining against the noise of traffic, music,
 
Anything alive, to catch your key in the door.
And that scamper of feeling in my chest,
 
As if the day, the night, wherever it is
I am by then, has been only a whir
 
Of something other than waiting.
 
We hear so much about what love feels like.
Right now, today, with the rain outside,
 
And leaves that want as much as I do to believe
In May, in seasons that come when called,
 
It’s impossible not to want
To walk into the next room and let you
 
Run your hands down the sides of my legs,
Knowing perfectly well what they know."
1028,Interrogative,Tracy K. Smith,"1. Falmouth, Massachusetts, 1972
 
Oak table, knotted legs, the chirp
And scrape of tines to mouth.
Four children, four engines
Of want. That music.
 
What did your hand mean to smooth
Across the casket of your belly?
What echoed there, if not me—tiny body
Afloat, akimbo, awake or at rest?
 
Every night you fed the others
Bread leavened with the grains
Of your own want. How
Could you stand me near you,
 
In you, jump and kick tricking
The heart, when what you prayed for
Was my father’s shadow, your name
In his dangerous script, an envelope
 
Smelling of gun-powder, bay rum,
Someone to wrestle, sing to, question,
Climb?
 
 
                        2. Interstate 101 South, California, 1981
 
Remember the radio, the Coca-Cola sign
Phosphorescent to the left, bridge
After bridge, as though our lives were
Engineered simply to go? And so we went
 
Into those few quiet hours
Alone together in the dark, my arm
On the rest beside yours, our lights
Pricking at fog, tugging us patiently
 
Forward like a needle through gauze.
Night held us like a house.
Sometimes an old song
Would fill the car like a ghost.

There’s still a pond behind your mother’s old house,
Still a stable with horses, a tractor rusted and stuck
Like a trophy in mud. And the red house you might
Have thrown stones at still stands on stilts up the dirt road.
 
A girl from the next town over rides in to lend us
Her colt, cries when one of us kicks it with spurs.
Her father wants to buy her a trailer, let her try her luck
In the shows. They stay for dinner under the tent
 
Your brother put up for the Fourth. Firebugs flare
And vanish. I am trying to let go of something.
My heart cluttered with names that mean nothing.
Our racket races out to the darkest part of the night.
 
The woods catch it and send it back.
 
 
                        4. But let’s say you’re alive again—
 
Your hands are long and tell your age.
You hold them there, twirling a bent straw,
And my reflection watches, hollow-faced,
Not trying to hide. The waiters make it seem
 
Like Cairo. Back and forth shouting
That sharp language. And for the first time
I tell you everything. No shame
In my secrets, shoddy as laundry.
 
I have praised your God
For the blessing of the body, snuck
From pleasure to pleasure, lying for it,
Holding it like a coin or a key in my fist.
 
I know now you’ve known all along.
 
I won’t change. I want to give
Everything away. To wander forever.
Here is a pot of tea. Let’s share it
Slowly, like sisters."

We like to think of it as parallel to what we know,
Only bigger. One man against the authorities.
Or one man against a city of zombies. One man
 
Who is not, in fact, a man, sent to understand
The caravan of men now chasing him like red ants
Let loose down the pants of America. Man on the run.
 
Man with a ship to catch, a payload to drop,
 This message going out to all of space. . . . Though
Maybe it’s more like life below the sea: silent,
 
Buoyant, bizarrely benign. Relics
Of an outmoded design. Some like to imagine
A cosmic mother watching through a spray of stars,
 
Mouthing yes, yes as we toddle toward the light,
Biting her lip if we teeter at some ledge. Longing
To sweep us to her breast, she hopes for the best
 
While the father storms through adjacent rooms
Ranting with the force of Kingdom Come,
Not caring anymore what might snap us in its jaw.
 
Sometimes,  what I see is a library in a rural community.
All the tall shelves in the big open room. And the pencils
In a cup at Circulation, gnawed on by the entire population.
 
The books have lived here all along, belonging
For weeks at a time to one or another in the brief sequence
Of family names, speaking (at night mostly) to a face,
 
A pair of eyes. The most remarkable lies.

Charlton Heston is waiting to be let in. He asked once politely.
A second time with force from the diaphragm. The third time,
He did it like Moses: arms raised high, face an apocryphal white.
 
Shirt crisp, suit trim, he stoops a little coming in,
Then grows tall. He scans the room. He stands until I gesture,
Then he sits. Birds commence their evening chatter. Someone fires
 
Charcoals out below. He’ll take a whiskey if I have it. Water if I don’t.
I ask him to start from the beginning, but he goes only halfway back.
 That was the future once, he says. Before the world went upside down.
  
Hero, survivor, God’s right hand man, I know he sees the blank
Surface of the moon where I see a language built from brick and bone.
He sits straight in his seat, takes a long, slow high-thespian breath,
 
Then lets it go. For all I know, I was the last true man on this earth. And:
 May I smoke? The voices outside soften. Planes jet past heading off or back.
Someone cries that she does not want to go to bed. Footsteps overhead.
 
A fountain in the neighbor’s yard babbles to itself, and the night air
Lifts the sound indoors. It was another time, he says, picking up again.
 We were pioneers. Will you fight to stay alive here, riding the earth
  
 Toward God-knows-where? I think of Atlantis buried under ice, gone
One day from sight, the shore from which it rose now glacial and stark.
Our eyes adjust to the dark.
 
 
          3.
 
Perhaps the great error is believing we’re alone,
 
That the others have come and gone—a momentary blip—
 
When all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,
 
Bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel
 
Nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,
 
Setting solid feet down on planets everywhere,
 
Bowing to the great stars that command, pitching stones
 
At whatever are their moons. They live wondering
 
If they are the only ones, knowing only the wish to know,
 
And the great black distance they—we—flicker in.
 
 
Maybe the dead know, their eyes widening at last,
 
Seeing the high beams of a million galaxies flick on
 
At twilight. Hearing the engines flare, the horns
 
Not letting up, the frenzy of being. I want to be
 
One notch below bedlam, like a radio without a dial.
 
Wide open, so everything floods in at once.
 
And sealed tight, so nothing escapes. Not even time,
 
Which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.
 
So that I might be sitting now beside my father
 
As he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe
 
For the first time in the winter of 1959.

In those last scenes of Kubrick’s 2001
When Dave is whisked into the center of space,
Which unfurls in an aurora of orgasmic light
Before opening wide, like a jungle orchid
For a love-struck bee, then goes liquid,
Paint-in-water, and then gauze wafting out and off,
Before, finally, the night tide, luminescent
And vague, swirls in, and on and on. . . . 
 
In those last scenes, as he floats
Above Jupiter’s vast canyons and seas,
Over the lava strewn plains and mountains
Packed in ice, that whole time, he doesn’t blink.
In his little ship, blind to what he rides, whisked
Across the wide-screen of unparcelled time,
Who knows what blazes through his mind?
Is it still his life he moves through, or does
That end at the end of what he can name?
 
On set, it’s shot after shot till Kubrick is happy,
Then the costumes go back on their racks
And the great gleaming set goes black.

When my father worked on the Hubble Telescope, he said
They operated like surgeons: scrubbed and sheathed
In papery green, the room a clean cold, a bright white.
 
He’d read Larry Niven at home, and drink scotch on the rocks,
His eyes exhausted and pink. These were the Reagan years,
When we lived with our finger on The Button and struggled
 
To view our enemies as children. My father spent whole seasons
Bowing before the oracle-eye, hungry for what it would find.
His face lit-up whenever anyone asked, and his arms would rise
 
As if he were weightless, perfectly at ease in the never-ending
Night of space. On the ground, we tied postcards to balloons
For peace. Prince Charles married Lady Di. Rock Hudson died.
 
We learned new words for things. The decade changed.
 
The first few pictures came back blurred, and I felt ashamed
For all the cheerful engineers, my father and his tribe. The second time,
The optics jibed. We saw to the edge of all there is—
 
So brutal and alive it seemed to comprehend us back."
1030,Sci-Fi,Tracy K. Smith,"There will be no edges, but curves.
Clean lines pointing only forward.

History, with its hard spine & dog-eared
Corners, will be replaced with nuance,

Just like the dinosaurs gave way
To mounds and mounds of ice.

Women will still be women, but
The distinction will be empty. Sex,

Having outlived every threat, will gratify
Only the mind, which is where it will exist.

For kicks, we'll dance for ourselves
Before mirrors studded with golden bulbs.

The oldest among us will recognize that glow—
But the word sun will have been re-assigned

To the Standard Uranium-Neutralizing device
Found in households and nursing homes.

And yes, we'll live to be much older, thanks
To popular consensus. Weightless, unhinged,

Eons from even our own moon, we'll drift
In the haze of space, which will be, once

And for all, scrutable and safe."

And it rolls out: high, shrill and metallic.

Of putting on my shoes to go up and see
Whether it is merely an experiment
Their parents have been conducting
Upon the good crystal, which must surely
Lie shattered to dust on the floor.

Maybe the mother is still proud
Of the four pink lungs she nursed
To such might. Perhaps, if they hit
The magic decibel, the whole building
Will lift-off, and we'll ride to glory
Like Elijah. If this is it—if this is what
Their cries are cocked toward—let the sky
Pass from blue, to red, to molten gold,
To black. Let the heaven we inherit approach.

 Whether it is our dead in Old Testament robes,
Or a door opening onto the roiling infinity of space.
Whether it will bend down to greet us like a father,
Or swallow us like a furnace. I'm ready
To meet what refuses to let us keep anything
For long. What teases us with blessings,
Bends us with grief. Wizard, thief, the great
Wind rushing to knock our mirrors to the floor,
To sweep our short lives clean. How mean

Our racket seems beside it. My stereo on shuffle.
The neighbor chopping onions through a wall.
All of it just a hiccough against what may never
Come for us. And the kids upstairs still at it,
Screaming like the Dawn of Man, as if something
They have no name for has begun to insist
Upon being born."
1032,The Universe: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Tracy K. Smith,"The first track still almost swings. High hat and snare, even
A few bars of sax the stratosphere will singe-out soon enough.

Synthesized strings. Then something like cellophane
Breaking in as if snagged to a shoe. Crinkle and drag. White noise,

Black noise. What must be voices bob up, then drop, like metal shavings
In molasses. So much for us. So much for the flags we bored

Into planets dry as chalk, for the tin cans we filled with fire
And rode like cowboys into all we tried to tame. Listen:

The dark we've only ever imagined now audible, thrumming,
Marbled with static like gristly meat. A chorus of engines churns.

Silence taunts: a dare. Everything that disappears
Disappears as if returning somewhere."

1035,The Café Filtre,Paul Blackburn,"Slowly and with persistence
he eats away at the big steak,
gobbles up the asparagus, its
butter & salt & root taste,
drinks at a glass of red wine, and carefully
                             taking his time, mops up
               the gravy with bread—
The top of the café filtre is
copper, passively shines back, & between
mouthfuls of steak, sips of wine,
                             he remembers
               at intervals to
with the flat of his hand
the top removed,
                                       bang
at the apparatus,

the water will
                          fall through
                          more quickly
 
Across the tiles of the floor, the
cat comes to the table  :  again.
“I’ve already given you one piece of steak,
what do you want from me now? Love?”
                            He strokes her head, her
rounded black pregnant head, her greedy
     front paws slip from his knee,
     the pearl of great price
     ignored  .  She’s bored, he
bangs the filtre again, its top is copper
passively shines back  .

finished.

to add cream and sugar, he offers the last
piece of steak with his fingers  .

                                      dignity,
even delicacy  .  The coffee goes down at a gulp, it
is black
& lukewarm  ."
1036,Charlie Howard’s Descent,Mark Doty,"Between the bridge and the river
he falls through
a huge portion of night;
it is not as if falling

is something new. Over and over
he slipped into the gulf
between what he knew and how
he was known. What others wanted

opened like an abyss: the laughing
stock-clerks at the grocery, women
at the luncheonette amused by his gestures.
What could he do, live

with one hand tied
behind his back? So he began to fall
into the star-faced section
of night between the trestle

and the water because he could not meet
a little town’s demands,
and his earrings shone and his wrists
were as limp as they were.

I imagine he took the insults in
and made of them a place to live;
we learn to use the names
because they are there,

familiar furniture: faggot
was the bed he slept in, hard
and white, but simple somehow,
 queer something sharp

but finally useful, a tool,
all the jokes a chair,
stiff-backed to keep the spine straight,
a table, a lamp. And because

he’s fallen for twenty-three years,
despite whatever awkwardness
his flailing arms and legs assume
he is beautiful

and like any good diver
has only an edge of fear
he transforms into grace.
Or else he is not afraid,

and in this way climbs back
up the ladder of his fall,
out of the river into the arms
of the three teenage boys

who hurled him from the edge—
really boys now, afraid,
their fathers’ cars shivering behind them,
headlights on—and tells them

it’s all right, that he knows
they didn’t believe him
when he said he couldn’t swim,
and blesses his killers

in the way that only the dead
can afford to forgive."

1038,Signature Song,Bill Berkson,"Bunny Berigan first recorded “I Can’t Get Started”
with a small group that included Joe Bushkin, Cozy Cole
and Artie Shaw in 1936.
Earlier that same year, the song,
written by Ira Gershwin and Vernon Duke,
and rendered as a duet patter number by Bob Hope and Eve
Arden, made its debut on Broadway in The Ziegfeld Follies. 
By 1937, when Berigan re-recorded it in a big-band setting,
“I Can’t” had become his signature song, 
even though, within a few months, Billie Holiday would record
her astonishing version backed
by Lester Young and the rest of the Basie Orchestra.
 
Lovers for a time, Lee Wiley and Berigan began appearing
together on Wiley’s fifteen-minute CBS radio spot,
 Saturday Night Swing Club, in 1936.
Berigan died from alcoholism-related causes on June 2, 1942.
Although “I Can’t Get Started” is perfectly suited to Wiley’s
deep phrasing and succinct vibrato, she recorded the ballad only
once, informally, in 1945, during a Town Hall performance date.
The Spanish Civil War started in 1936 and ended in 1939
with Generalissimo Francisco Franco’s forces entering Madrid.
“I’ve settled revolutions in Spain” goes Gershwin’s lyric, just as odd."

Am I not the rubberized universe?
I am its buffer and get to name things for what they are,
who they serve—what order.
 
A plural centipede burrows outbound,
crawls the spine of my hand,
tells my pencil to move along, give out lead.
Months of illness do that to a puppet,
gnaw at her strings, place moths on her neighbors,
blend them with gypsies who live the treetops uprooted.
 
Dare the deliberately happy to butterfly the gnarled roots of life—
 
That we pass too many pounds of flesh uncut.
Too much genius hermitted in stereo.
The round tables forgetting their bird seed.
Clovers push luck to surround these hollow legs.
 
Why no windows on the sides of houses?
Why no flames beneath stones that burn?
Why do all minutes lead the blue carp and black eel now?
 
We’ll be passing through heaven in a split pea shell,
emptied of light, hard as effusive green
ore the blood corrupts daily, within and without."

where
his body blew and left enclosure intact,
skeletal innards
enough to make moviegoers ask,
“Has anyone finished themselves yet?”
I haven’t. I swim the lagoon, take note:
the babies are barely dirty,
their armpits smooth with silky soot
weighted in apartment cycles like
we keep movement in boxes for thunderstorms,
and the railroad leaves a dancing behavior
absorbed by every second thought,
escaping the socket that was his mission,
his body incomplete, to help us
to the maidenhead of Niagara,

A kindred-ided up and up, born of dormant corners

1045,Journal: April 19 : The Southern Tier,Paul Blackburn,"I

look out the window in upstate New York, see

the Mediterranean stretching out below me

down the rocky hillside at Faro, three

years, two months, fourteen days earlier .

8:25 A. M.

Rosemary gone back to sleep, pink & white . I

stand at the livingroom window drinking coffee, open

the doors to the balcony . Warmth beginning, tho

I wrap my hands around the cup, count

fishing boats in the sunglare, moving shoreward now

slowly, or

sitting there motionless on the flat sea .

a fat blue arm stretches out from the coast, ripples

where wind and currents show

muscle below the blue skin of sea

stretched out below me .

                                                  The coffee’s

cold toward the end of the cup . I go

back to the kitchen for more hot . put

orange in bathrobe pocket, reach for knife, return

to the balcony with the fresh cup where the flat blue sea

fills my eye in the sunglare . stretches out below me.

 

The Southern Tier:    the maple outside the window

warms in the early sun . red buds at the ends of branches

commence their slow bursting . Green soon

                           her legs against mine in the hall, goes down to

start my egg . Carlos thumps the lower stairs . We move.

 

All our farewells al-

ready prepared inside us   .   aaaall our

deaths we carry inside us, double-yolked, the

fragile toughness of the shell   .   it makes

sustenance possible, makes love    possible

as the red buds break against the sunglight

possible green, as legs move against legs

possible softnesses     .     The soft-boiled

egg is ready now  .

We are all snow birds atop
the cherry blossoms of August.
Springtime in Washington D.C.
passed too fast, nearly in the flash of Rose
brushing her teeth over the bedpan.
 
No adrenal gland has known such cortisol,

A long time ago! 
Wide open stood my chamber door, 
And one stepped forth to greet; 
Gray Grief, strange Grief, who turned me sore 
With words he spake so sweet. 
I gave him meat; I gave him drink; 
(And listened for Love’s feet.) 
How many years? I cannot think; 
In truth, I do not know— 
Ah, long time ago! 
Oh, love, he came not back again, 
Although I kept me fair; 
And each white May, in field and lane, 
I waited for him there! 
Yea, he forgot; but Grief stayed on, 
And in Love’s empty chair 
Doth sit and tell of days long gone— 
’Tis more than I can bear!"

I think that I shall never fear
a brontosaurus that is queer,

iguanodon as fetisheer,
a mammoth bringing up the rear,
an astrodon with extra gear,

metrosexual squirrel and deer,
a breeder with a dance career,
a fruit with cauliflower ear,

a lesbianic Chanticleer,
a grinning limpish-wristed Lear,
the weird one or the mutineer,

but those who perfectly adhere,
stay clear, stay clear, stay clear, stay clear."
1050,The Arch,Patricia Lockwood,"Of all living monuments has the fewest
facts attached to it, they slide right off
its surface, no Lincoln lap for them to sit
on and no horse to be astride. Here is what
                                                 I know for sure:

Was a gift from one city to another. A city
cannot travel to another city, a city cannot visit 
any city but itself, and in its sadness it gives
        away a great door in the air. Well 
        a city cannot except for Paris, who puts
on a hat styled with pigeon wings and walks
through the streets of another city and will not
even see the sights, too full she is of the sights
already. And within her walk her women, 
        and the women of Paris looking like 
        they just walked through an Arch...

        Or am I mixing it up I think I am 
with another famous female statue? Born
in its shadow and shook-foil hot the facts
slid off me also. I and the Arch we burned
to the touch. “Don’t touch that Arch a boy
we know got third-degree burns from touch-
        ing that Arch,” says my mother sitting
for her statue. She is metal on a hilltop and
so sad she isn’t a Cross. She was long ago
given to us by Ireland. What an underhand
        gift for an elsewhere to give, a door 
that reminds you you can leave it. She raises
        her arm to brush my hair. Oh no female
armpit lovelier than the armpit of the Arch."
1051,Bad Sheep,Hailey Leithauser,"Midnight’s merely blue,
but me, me, me, I’m 
through 
and through 
sloe, cracked soot-
on-a-boot, 
nicotine spat, licorice whip. 
You can scratch, scratch, scratch 
but I stay underskin true 
to ebony, ink, crowberry, pitch;
hoist me up by my hooves 
and shake till I’m shook, I’m still 
chock full of coke, fuliginous 
murk.
O there’s swart in my soul,
coal by the bag, 
cinders and slag, 
scoriac grit, so please
come, comb 
through my fleece with hands pallid 
as snow and watch 
how they grow tarry, raven, 
stygian, ashed— 
or, if you wish, clean me with bleach
I won’t 
flinch, just char 
down to a core of caliginous 
marrow,
pure carbon, atramentous,
utterly piceous, 
shadowed, and starless,
each clumpity clump 
and eclipse of my heart raptly 
re-burnishing 
a woolgather dark."
1052,Bemidji Blues,Sean Hill,"For Arnold Rampersad 

Shadows bluing the snow, the pines’ and mine, 
bear the cast of a kestrel’s blue-gray crown 
I note as I find my way about this town. 

Blues here more likely the Nordic-eyes kind 
than the blue-black of some Black folk back home.
Here so many lakes reflect the sky’s blue dome; 

some summer days skimmed-milk blue tints windblown 
whitecaps. Blue’s an adjective, verb, and noun, 
and the color of the world when I pine 

because she’s gone leaving too much wine and time. 
Blue shadows on the snow, mine and the pines’. 
For a tall man, blue ox, and now me, home 

is Bemidji, though the blues here around 
more the cast of a kestrel’s blue-gray crown 
than the blue-black of my cousins back home."
1053,The Breeder’s Cup,David Lehman,"I. TO THE FATES

They cannot keep the peace
or their hands off each other,
breed not yet preach 
the old discredited creed.

Love is charity conceived 
as a coin dropped 
in a beggar’s cup.
Reason not the need. 

Gluttony is no nicer than greed
or wrath, but lust
is our categorical must.
We have no choice but to breed.

 II. OLYMPIA
Olympia lies on her couch
with an insolent stare,
her hand hiding her crotch,
a flower in her hair.

She splits the lot of us with a sneer: 
we are either breeders or queer.
We will fight wars because of her.
She will root us on. We will win.

The face in the mirror is not brave,
but we crave contact with her skin
and the jewel in the mouth of her cave.
She tempts like a sin

and under her spell we fall
into a deep enchanted sleep,
and wake up ready to make the leap,
ready to heed her call,

only now we’re alone,
on streets less friendly than wilderness,
a platoon of ex-pals in Manhattan.
Olympia tempts like a sin,

but then sends us home to the wife,
commands us to resume the life
we had planned to give up in her honor:
the life of a dutiful husband, a modest success

in his profession, impressive 
in credentials, in mood depressive
(but nothing that a pill won’t cure).
You ask if he is happy? “Sure.”

And Olympia lies on her couch,
with her insolent stare,
her hand hiding her crotch,
a flower in her hair."
1054,Hook,Ellery Akers,"One year a general
packs the dead arithmetic in a drawer—
all the subtractions, divisions.
The next year, vines cover the bunkers.
The brain resumes its starbursts of rehearsal.
The heart leaps under the defibrillator.
The bone eases into its socket.
Skin grows back. Scars fade. Eyes clear.
Look at the trees at the burn, six years later.
Look at the sprout on a hay bale
on a truck. Look at the woman who was raped,
had her hands cut off in a creek:
She’s getting married.
The choir sings. The bride smiles.
The groom slips a ring on her hook."
1055,Horse Apocalypse,Amit Majmudar,"Hrhm Shp, colt-culling,
Is what hoof lore calls it—
The choke-chain sound a roan coined
To describe the things he saw
Before the sniff weevils crept 
Up his nostrils and chewed
His eyes at the hue-sweet root.

Mother mares scare foals
From folly-trots and foxglove
By telling them fury tales
Of muck stirrup-deep and shells
Shoveling Passchendaele
Onto Passchendaele,
The foal fallen with the boy.

                      •

One memory, common
To all breeds, spurs night mares
Sparking down the mute streets
Of their sleep, gas-blind
Witnesses scraping Krupp
Guns over the cobblestones,
Winged sparks breeding in the hay.

                      •

Having watched us box and ditch 
Our dead, they thought our dead
Ate termite-runnels
In the black bark of the land
And pulled all horsefolk down
To join whatever dark cavalry
Thundered underground.

                      •

The burlap gas mask cupped
And strapped to the wet snout
Could be mistaken, when
The gas gong sounded
And the men grew fly-heads, 
For a feed sack chock- 
Full of red ants."
1056,In Colorado My Father Scoured and Stacked Dishes,Eduardo C. Corral,"in a Tex-Mex restaurant. His co-workers,
unable to utter his name, renamed him Jalapeño. 

If I ask for a goldfish, he spits a glob of phlegm 
into a jar of water. The silver letters 

on his black belt spell Sangrón. Once, borracho, 
at dinner, he said: Jesus wasn’t a snowman. 

Arriba Durango. Arriba Orizaba. Packed 
into a car trunk, he was smuggled into the States. 

Frijolero. Greaser. In Tucson he branded 
cattle. He slept in a stable. The horse blankets 

oddly fragrant: wood smoke, lilac. He’s an illegal. 
I’m an Illegal-American. Once, in a grove 

of saguaro, at dusk, I slept next to him. I woke 
with his thumb in my mouth. ¿No qué no 

tronabas, pistolita? He learned English 
by listening to the radio. The first four words 

he memorized: In God We Trust. The fifth: 
Percolate. Again and again I borrow his clothes. 

He calls me Scarecrow. In Oregon he picked apples. 
Braeburn. Jonagold. Cameo. Nightly, 

to entertain his cuates, around a campfire, 
he strummed a guitarra, sang corridos. Arriba 

Durango. Arriba Orizaba. Packed into 
a car trunk, he was smuggled into the States. 

Greaser. Beaner. Once, borracho, at breakfast, 
he said: The heart can only be broken 

once, like a window. ¡No mames! His favorite 
belt buckle: an águila perched on a nopal. 

If he laughs out loud, his hands tremble. 
Bugs Bunny wants to deport him. César Chávez 

wants to deport him. When I walk through 
the desert, I wear his shirt. The gaze of the moon 

stitches the buttons of his shirt to my skin. 
The snake hisses. The snake is torn."
1057,In Extremis,Patricia Kirkpatrick,"You don’t get everything back.
Is today morning or night? The radio voice says
the composer is changing the place home is. 
When they try to put a tube down her throat, 
the woman beside me sobs. Nurses probe
a vein as she thrashes, call the Hmong translator.

Once a boy told me, in Laos he sat in a tree 
all night. Father pay me dollar for every man I’m shooting. 
When there’s water to cross, the fish, caught,
get needled through gill slits. Down the dark hall,
machines bleat at each bed. Eyes open and shut: flashes,
detachment, vitreous gel. Her son, seven years old,
comes after school, peels oranges, watches football, 
changing the place home is."
1058,Islands,Yusef Komunyakaa,"For Derek Walcott

An island is one great eye
    gazing out, a beckoning lighthouse,
searchlight, a wishbone compass,
    or counterweight to the stars.
When it comes to outlook & point
    of view, a figure stands on a rocky ledge
peering out toward an archipelago
    of glass on the mainland, a seagull’s
wings touching the tip of a high wave,
    out to where the brain may stumble.

But when a mind climbs down
    from its high craggy lookout
we know it is truly a stubborn thing,
    & has to leaf through pages of dust
& light, through pre-memory & folklore,
    remembering fires roared down there
till they pushed up through the seafloor
    & plumes of ash covered the dead 
shaken awake worlds away, & silence
    filled up with centuries of waiting.

Sea urchin, turtle, & crab
    came with earthly know-how,
& one bird arrived with a sprig in its beak,
    before everything clouded with cries,
a millennium of small deaths now topsoil
    & seasons of blossoms in a single seed.
Light edged along salt-crusted stones,
    across a cataract of blue water,
& lost sailors’ parrots spoke of sirens, 
    the last words of men buried at sea.

Someone could stand here
    contemplating the future, leafing
through torn pages of St. Augustine
    or the prophecies by fishermen,
translating spore & folly down to taproot.
    The dreamy-eyed boy still in the man,
the girl in the woman, a sunny forecast
    behind today, but tomorrow’s beyond
words. To behold a body of water
    is to know pig iron & mother wit. 

Whoever this figure is,
    he will soon return to dancing 
through the aroma of dagger’s log,
    ginger lily, & bougainvillea,
between chants & strings struck
    till gourds rally the healing air,
& till the church-steeple birds
    fly sweet darkness home.
Whoever this friend or lover is,
    he intones redemptive harmonies. 

To lie down in remembrance
    is to know each of us is a prodigal
son or daughter, looking out beyond land
    & sky, the chemical & metaphysical
beyond falling & turning waterwheels
    in the colossal brain of damnable gods,
a Eureka held up to the sun’s blinding eye,
    born to gaze into fire. After conquering
frontiers, the mind comes back to rest, 
    stretching out over the white sand."
1059,John Hancock’s John Hancock,Jason Guriel,"makes wind
the way it whirls
about and blows
the neighboring names
of other signatories
away. The point
of it is not
the John or Jane
Doe it names;
the point’s the quill
in motion as if
still stuck 
and aquiver in 
goose skin. 
The trick to writing
well isn’t up
the sleeve. It is 
the sleeve
that fluffs up 
the flourish,
that blooms around
the stunted stamens
of the fingers
and distracts us
from our grasping
for the sun
or the uncertain
scratching
of the stylus."
1060,Little Ice Age,Kathy Nilsson,"I have one good memory—a total 

Eclipse of the sun—when out of brilliance 

Dusk came swiftly and on the whole 

At seven years it felt good on a summer afternoon 

To be outrun by a horse from another century—

The next morning I washed up 

On land like a pod of seals 

Struck with a longing for dark at noon—

If the cessation of feeling is temporary

It resembles sleep—if permanent, it resembles

A little ice age—and the end of some 

Crewelwork by a mother who put honey

Into my hands so the bees would love me."
1061,A Magnetic Personality,Jason Guriel,"marc-antonizes.
Somehow it organizes
the mob—like so
much lead—into rank
and file. Somehow
it stands us 
rabble up and makes
a row of men stiffen
or a rose of lead filings 
arise. A rose is a rose
that arose, a magnetic
personality very
nearly said. She knew
how to draw
this one painter
to her place in Paris
and make him something
greater. (She knew
how to cube him.) 
But the magnetic 
can turn on
a dime and go
all red like a face
of a Rubik’s Cube. 
In fact, its flip
side can repel what it
once sucked in—
all those friends,
Romans, countrymen,
cubists."
1062,Nulla Dies Sine Linea,V. Penelope Pelizzon,"On my birthday

A crow guffaws, dirty man throwing the punch of his 
one joke. And now, nearer, a murder 

answers, chortling from the pale hill’s brow. 
From under my lashes’ wings they stretch 

clawed feet. There the unflappable years 
perch and stare. When I squint, when I 

grin, my new old face nearly hops 
off my old new face. Considering what’s flown, 

what might yet fly, I lean my chin 
on the palm where my half-cashed fortune lies."
1063,Numbered,Tara Bray,"The girl was known for shitting in her yard.  
I did so little for her.  She was small, a dandelion orb 
with ragged hair like an old woman’s burnt from dye.  
Her face showed little sign of poverty—
it was her dusty shoes cut open at the top that told.
A bone look she’d mastered young, yet the curve 
of her face was edible, like a rounded sparrow in hand.  
She wasn’t mean, but did what she wanted—quietly, 
with a lift to her chin, while I struggled to teach her anything. 
I’d like to say I brushed her brittle hair, called her beautiful, 
coaxed out sight words that dawdled on her tongue.   
I dream of her spinning like a fairy dervish in my failure.  
Consider this a prayer, a foolish one."
1064,Omens,Yusef Komunyakaa,"Her eyelids were painted blue.
When she closed her eyes the sea
rolled in like ten thousand fiery chariots,

leaving behind silence above & below
a thousand years old. He stood beneath
a high arched window, gazing out

at fishing boats beyond the dikes, their nets
unfurled, their offshore gestures
a dance of living in bluish entourage.

He was only the court’s chief jester.
What he said & did made them laugh,
but lately what he sometimes thought he knew

could cost him his polished tongue & royal wig.
He was the masked fool unmasking the emperor.
Forget the revelation. Forget the briny sea.

He had seen the ravishing empress naked
in a forbidden pose. Her blue eye shadow.
Aquamarine shells crusted with wormy mud. 

Anyway, if he said half of what was foretold,
the great one would become a weeping boy
slumped beneath the Pillars of Hercules."
1065,Once upon a Time,Anthony Madrid,"Once upon a time,
There was a beautiful shark.
She combed her long, blonde hair,
And it made the halibut bark.

It made the chicken oink,
And the whale to run for Congress.
A man should never obstruct
The course of material progress.

Yet a lamb cannot but weep
When the kiddies come home from college.
For they have forgotten to keep
The agreement they made to acknowledge

The woodpecker’s right to peck,
And the maple’s to be pecked at.
Let’s have a little respect
For Rubber Duck with a doctorate.  

That provocative way of standing!
All elbows and bangles
And hips just like a coat hanger
And ankles at right angles! I like 

The shape of the pouring soy milk,
The sound of the splitting log.
But Egret finds it regrettable that her
Sister is dating a dog.

Don’t listen to ’em, kid!
And don’t listen to their questions.
This corporation’s been ruined by
Well-meaning false confessions.

And the world is fast a-melting,
Though I would have it slow.
And I don’t think it’s helping:
The way these animals go

Straight from hatchery to quackery,
And, if only to amuse,
I’ll throw my hat in with Mike Thataway in
Black patent leather shoes.

Maybe I’m just like my mother.
She’s never satisfied.
Maybe I’m just like my father:
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

Maybe I’m just like my cat:
Licking invisible balls.
Perhaps you’ll reflect upon that, 
Next time you’re screening your calls.

And all the solvent and the solute,
They were walking hand in hand.
This the Indian poets were the
First to understand.

The ancient Indian poets
Had their heads screwed on straight.
Fixed on the body’s affluence
And the effluents that escape.

And the influence they enjoyed?
Close-focus hocus-pocus.
And every gezunte moyd
In a juvenile honey locust

Will prefer their Hindi distichs
To the Indiana Hoosiers.
We’re gonna be there from Spit Christmas
All the way to Mucus New Year’s.

But for now I draw the curtain
And settle into Lent.
Last person to go to Harvard
Without knowing what that meant."
1066,Political Reflection,Howard Nemerov,"loquitur the sparrow in the Zoo

 No bars are set too close, no mesh too fine 
To keep me from the eagle and the lion, 
Whom keepers feed that I may freely dine. 
This goes to show that if you have the wit 
To be small, common, cute, and live on shit, 
Though the cage fret kings, you may make free with it.

as you again lose yourself
in a white field’s point of view.

In this glacial quiet
nothing moves except—
then a flash of eyes & nerves.

If cornered in your head by cries from a cave
in another season, you can’t forget
in this landscape a pretty horse
translates into a man holding a gun."
1070,Song,Muriel Rukeyser,"Make and be eaten, the poet says,
Lie in the arms of nightlong fire,
To celebrate the waking, wake.
Burn in the daylong light; and praise
Even the mother unappeased,
Even the fathers of desire.

Blind go the days, but joy will see 
Agreements of music; they will wind 
The shaking of your dance; no more 
Will the ambiguous arm-waves spell 
Confusion of the blessing given. 

Only and finally declare 
Among the purest shapes of grace 
The waking of the face of fire, 
The body of waking and the skill 
To make your body such a shape 
That all the eyes of hope shall stare. 

That all the cries of fear shall know, 
Staring in their bird-pierced song; 
Lines of such penetration make 
That shall bind our loves at last. 
Then from the mountains of the lost, 
All the fantasies shall wake, 
Strong and real and speaking turn 
Wherever flickers your unreal. 

And my strong ghosts shall fade and pass 
My love start fiery as grass 
Wherever burn my fantasies, 
Wherever burn my fantasies.

for you, O brittle-hearted, we bring offering 
remembering how your wrists were thin and your delicate bones 
not yet braced for conquering. 

The sharp cries of ghost-boys are keen above the meadows, 
and little girls continue graceful and wondering. 
Flickering evening on the lakes recalls those young 
heirs whose developing years have sunk to earth, 
their strength not tested, their praise unsung. 

Weave grasses for their childhood—who will never see 
love or disaster or take sides against decay 
balancing the choices of maturity. 
Silent and coffined in silence while we pass 
loud in defiance of death, the helpless lie.

You are an oyamel native to the mountains of Mexico

Rising in a cloud forest of sister evergreens
Shedding pollen cones, shedding winged seeds

Our lost wings 
                    singly and in pairs.

This is why the monarchs vanish    
Raising sienna-hued colonies longer than my arms

Hibernating in Mexico where it’s hotter in January
                than my front yard, where the red bougainvillea raves

And magnolias             with a mauve rush on paper
And open as though thinking about last year’s novels

Obey the apostle’s exhortation 
And do everything in love."

What is the under-shell
and is it tough as a mangrove?

Can he see through his shell-box?
Can he see out the rear
                        to this sea of ours?

Does he exist in the order of things?
How does life begin, when does it end
            and is that good or evil?

Teacup pigs we breed and obsessive mice  

Worrying themselves bald in a miniature opera.

For pleasures of the tongue we are

Winking cattle out of meadows 

Slashing their throats and swiftly quartering them.

In riding habits with gold flame pins we ride horses

To hounds, chase a fennec fox until his red

Coat flares up against the extinction 

Of light. Once in a circus we made

An elephant disappear and he did not mind."

I’m singed but intact: I don’t burn down the house.

Later, cleared to drive, I did outpatient rehab. Others
lost legs or clutched withered minds in their hands.
A man who can’t speak recognized me

Plaster of Paris 
Lilies of the field, 
You are not alive, therefore 
Pathos will be out of place. 

But I have learned 
A strange fact about your fate, 
And it is this: 

After you go out of fashion 
Beneath your many fashions, 
Or when your elbows and knees 
Have been bruised powdery white, 
So that you are no good to anybody— 

They will take away your gowns, 
Your sables and bathing suits, 
Leaving exposed before all men 
Your inaccessible bellies 
And pointless nubilities. 

Movers will come by night 
And load you all into trucks
And take you away to the Camps, 
Where soldiers, or the State Police, 
Will use you as targets 
For small-arms practice, 

Leading me to inquire, 
Since pathos is out of place, 
What it is that they are practicing.

November 1961"
1077,Vision Test,Patricia Kirkpatrick,"The brain, like the earth, lies in layers.
Floaters dart and punch. I see the field. 
My face stays numb. Keep your eye on the target.
Click the button when a light appears.
Last night I read “So little evidence is left
of what had vanished.” I can’t always follow directions.
The tumor pressed a lobe, charging
the amygdala, emotional core of the self.
In school they taught us that soil covers core
and mantle; mythology explains creation
and change. Now age drapes childhood;
my hair, the incision. I see a light but forget
to click. I didn’t remember dreams for a year. 
How I’ve changed may not be apparent."
1078,Wisconsin,Nate Klug,"By new names
and then no names
at all, their laws
will reach your land,

Lorine, to feed
on your much loved
marshy spaces
whose occasional faces

discern a stranger
from far off
but like to take
a break from well

or welding just
to talk. We can-
not extricate
a place from those

it’s made of, the sounds 
it makes. But now
from Blackhawk
Island to Madison

to Washington,
geologies
thin; more things 
sound or work

the same. Their laws 
will reach your land, 
Lorine, by new names
then no names at all."
1079,The Wooden Overcoat,Rick Barot,"It turns out there’s a difference between a detail
and an image. If the dandelion on the sidewalk is
mere detail, the dandelion inked on a friend’s bicep
is an image because it moves when her body does,

even when a shirt covers the little thorny black sun
on a thin stalk. The same way that the bar code
on the back of another friend’s neck is just a detail,
until you hear that the row of numbers underneath

are the numbers his grandfather got on his arm
in a camp in Poland. Then it’s an image, something
activated in the reader’s senses beyond mere fact.
I know the difference doesn’t matter, except in poetry,

where a coffin is just another coffin until someone
at a funeral calls it a wooden overcoat, an image
so heavy and warm at the same time that you forget
it’s about death. At my uncle’s funeral, the coffin

was so beautiful it was like the chandelier lighting
the room where treaties are signed. It made me think
of how loved he was. It made me think of Shoshone
funerals, where everything the dead person owned

was put into a bonfire, even the horse. In that last
sentence, is the horse a detail or an image? I don’t 
really know. In my mind, a horse is never anywhere 
near a fire, and a detail is as luminous as an image.

The trumpet vine on the sagging fence. The clothes
in the fire. And each tattoo that I touch on your back:
the three-part illustration of how to use chopsticks,
the four-leaf clover, the clock face stopped at 12:05."
1080,Work,Nate Klug,"It hides its edges
in speed, it has
no edges. Plus every time
he thinks he knows

it close enough, can discriminate
centripetal force
from what gets sheared
straight off,

direction changes:
through stunned space the blade
snaps back,
turtles into its handle

and starts over spinning 
the other way. 
All along the chopped-up sidewalk 
(the need to keep 

breaking what we make
to keep making)
the concrete saw 
plunges and resurfaces,

precise as a skull;
it glints against 
the small smoke
of its own work."
1081,You Can’t Build a Child,Sandra Simonds,"with the medicinal poppies of June
nor with Celan’s bloom-fest of dredged stone, 
      not with history’s choo-choo train of corpses,
    not with Nottingham’s Robin Hood 
            nor Antwerp’s Diamondland.

Not walking on the Strand in Manhattan Beach with her
      silicone breast implants, refinery, waves of trash,
        not out of the Library of Alexandria 
            with her burnt gardens that prefigure gnarly,
        barnacle-laden surfboards broken in half. 

You can’t build the child with the stone paths 
        that we have walked on through the atmosphere,
            the pirate’s plank, the diving board, the plunge,
          nor with the moon whether 
                she be zombie or vampire.
        Not with Delphi, not with fangs, or cardamom bought
                in Fez, red with spring, red with
                    marathon running cheeks.

            Not with monk chant, bomb chant, 
        war paint, not with the gigantic Zen pleasure zones, 
                nor with this harnessed pig 
        on the carousel that I am sitting on with my son 
                in Nice, France. How it burns on its axis
            as if it were turning into pineapple-colored kerosene 
        the way the Hawaiian pig, apple in snout, roasts 
            in its own tropical meat under the countdown sun."
1082,"By the Well of Living and Seeing, Part II, Section 28: “During the Second World War”",Charles Reznikoff,"During the Second World War, I was going home one night
along a street I seldom used. All the stores were closed
except one—a small fruit store.
An old Italian was inside to wait on customers.
As I was paying him I saw that he was sad.
“You are sad,” I said. “What is troubling you?”
“Yes,” he said, “I am sad.” Then he added
in the same monotone, not looking at me:
“My son left for the front today and I’ll never see him again.”
“Don’t say that!” I said. “Of course, you will!”
“No,” he answered. “I’ll never see him again.”
 
Afterwards, when the war was over,
I found myself once more in that street 
and again it was late at night, dark and lonely;
and again I saw the old man alone in the store.
I bought some apples and looked closely at him:
his thin wrinkled face was grim
but not particularly sad. “How about your son?” I said.
“Did he come back from the war?” “Yes,” he answered.
“He was not wounded?” “No. He is all right.”
“That’s fine,” I said. “Fine!”
He took the bag of apples from my hands and groping inside
took out one that had begun to rot
and put in a good one instead.
“He came back at Christmas,” he added.
“How wonderful! That was wonderful!”
“Yes,” he said gently, “it was wonderful.”
He took the bag of apples from my hands again
and took out one of the smaller apples and put in a large one."
1083,Absences,Mark Vinz,"“Even when you are not in a room, you are in it, your voice everywhere.” –Bill Holm

        “Even when you are not in a room,
        you are in it, your voice everywhere.”  –Bill Holm

The message that’s recorded on the phone
is unmistakably bad news, and then
another call tells us it’s one we love—
a sudden death while traveling, somehow
appropriate for one who always
seized life too completely to stand still.

A door slams shut, a wall has dropped away,
and once again I’m driven back to
empty pages, insufficient words,
to rooms he always filled on entering—
rooms lined with books, piano music, and
good friends who raise their glasses one last time.

And now, as all the lights are blinking off
in every prairie town we’ve ever loved,
when all the toasts are made and songs are sung,
when leaving is the only certainty,
a single voice keeps echoing, along
each dark, untraveled hallway of the heart."
1084,Disarmed,Wendy Videlock,"I should be diligent and firm,
I know I should, and frowning, too;
again you’ve failed to clean your room.
Not only that, the evidence
of midnight theft is in your bed—
cracked peanut shells and m&m’s
are crumbled where you rest your head,
and just above, the windowsill
is crowded with a green giraffe
(who’s peering through your telescope),
some dominoes, and half a glass
of orange juice. You hungry child,

how could I be uncharmed by this,
your secret world, your happy mess?"
1085,I still can’t get it right,Kathryn Stripling Byer,"I don’t know. I still can’t get it right,
the way those dirt roads cut across the flats
and led to shacks where hounds and muddy shoats
skulked roundabouts. Describing it sounds trite
as hell, the good old South I love to hate.
The truth? What’s that? How should I know?
I stayed inside too much. I learned to boast
of stupid things. I kept my ears shut tight,
as we kept doors locked, windows locked,
the curtains drawn. Now I know why.
The dark could hide things from us. Dark could see
what we could not. Sometimes those dirt roads shocked
me, where they ended up: I watched a dog die
in the ditch. The man who shot him winked at me."
1086,Isaac’s Blessing,Janet Eigner,"When Isaac, a small, freckled boy
approaching seven, visits us for Family Camp,
playing pirate with his rubber sword,

sometimes he slumps in grief, 
trudging along, his sacrifice and small violin
in hand, his palm over his chest,

saying, Mother is here 
in my heart. Before he leaves for home, 
we ask if he’d like a Jewish blessing.

Our grandson’s handsome face ignites;
he chirps a rousing, yes, for a long life.
We unfold the prayer shawl,

its Hebrew letters silvering the spring light,
hold the white tallis above his head,
recite the blessing in its ancient language

and then the English, adding, for a long life.
Isaac complains, the tallis didn’t
touch his head, so he didn’t feel the blessing.

We lower its silken ceiling
to graze his dark hair,
repeat the prayer."
1087,Marriage,Dan Gerber,"When you are angry it’s your gentle self
I love until that’s who you are.
In any case, I can’t love this anger any more
than I can warm my heart with ice.
I go on loving your smile
till it finds its way back to your face."
1088,Numbers,Jared Harél,"My grandmother never trusted calculators.
She would crunch numbers in a spiral notebook
at the kitchen table, watching her news.
 
 Work harder and I’d have more to count,
she’d snap at my father. And so my father worked
harder, fixed more mufflers, gave her receipts
 
but the numbers seldom changed.
There were silky things my mother wanted,
glorious dinners we could not afford.
 
Grandma would lecture her: no more garbage, 
and so our house was clean. The attic spotless.
In fact, it wasn’t until after she died
 
that my parents found out how much she had saved us.
What hidden riches had been kept in those notebooks,
invested in bonds, solid blue digits

etched on each page. She left them
in the kitchen by her black and white television
we tossed a week later, though it seemed to work fine."
1089,Prairie Sure,Carol Light,"Would I miss the way a breeze dimples
the butter-colored curtains on Sunday mornings,
or nights gnashed by cicadas and thunderstorms?
The leaning gossip, the half-alive ripple
of sunflowers, sagging eternities of corn
and sorghum, September preaching yellow, yellow
in all directions, the windowsills swelling
with Mason jars, the blue sky bluest borne
through tinted glass above the milled grains?
The dust, the heat, distrusted, the screen door
slapping as the slat-backed porch swing sighs,
the hatch of houseflies, the furlongs of freight trains,
and how they sing this routine, so sure, so sure—
the rote grace of every tempered life?"
1090,Red Balloon Rising,Laurel Blossom,"I tied it to your wrist
With a pretty pink bow, torn off
By the first little tug of wind.
I’m sorry.

I jumped to catch it, but not soon enough.
It darted away.

It still looked large and almost within reach.
Like a heart.

Watch, I said.
You squinted your little eyes.

The balloon looked happy, waving
Good-bye.

The sky is very high today, I said.
Red went black, a polka dot,

Then not. We watched it,
Even though we couldn’t

Spot it anymore at all.
Even after that."
1091,Taos,Jillena Rose,"Bones are easier to find than flowers
in the desert, so I paint these:
Fine white skulls of cows and horses.

When I lie flat under the stars
in the back of the car, coyotes howling
in the scrub pines, easy to feel how those bones
are so much like mine: Here is my pelvis,
like the pelvis I found today
bleached by the sun and the sand. Same
hole where the hip would go, same

white curve of bone beneath my flesh
same cradle of life, silent and still in me."
1092,My mother was like the bees,Jeanne Wagner,"because she needed a lavish taste
on her tongue,
a daily tipple of amber and gold
to waft her into the sky,
a soluble heat trickling down her throat.
Who could blame her
for starting out each morning
with a swig of something furious
in her belly, for days
when she dressed in flashy lamé
leggings like a starlet,
for wriggling and dancing a little madly,
her crazy reels and her rumbas,
for coming home wobbly
with a flicker of clover’s inflorescence
still clinging to her clothes,
enough to light the darkness
of a pitch-black hive."
1093,A Blind Fisherman,Stanley Moss,"I teach my friend, a fisherman gone blind, to cast
true left, right or center and how far
between lily pads and the fallen cedar.
Darkness is precious, how long will darkness last?
Our bait, worms, have no professors, they live
in darkness, can be taught fear of light.
Cut into threes even sixes they live
separate lives, recoil from light.
He tells me, “I am seldom blind
when I dream, morning is anthracite,
I play blind man’s bluff,
I cannot find myself,
my shoe, the sink,
tell time, but that’s spilled milk and ink,
the lost and found  I cannot find.
I can tell the difference between a mollusk and a whelk,
a grieving liar and a lemon rind.”
Laughing, he says, “I still hope the worm will turn,
 pink, lank, and warm, dined
out on apples of good fortune.
Books have a faintly legible smell.
Divorced from the sun, I am a kind
of bachelor henpecked by the night.
Sometimes I use my darkness well—
in the overcast and sunlight of my mind.
I can still wink, sing, my eyes are songs.”
Darkness is precious, how long will darkness last?
He could not fish, he could not walk, he fell
in his own feces. He wept. He died where he fell.
 The power of beauty to right all wrongs
is hard for me to sell."
1094,Bright Day,Stanley Moss,"I sing this morning: Hello, hello.
I proclaim the bright day of the soul.
The sun is a good fellow,
the devil is a good guy, no deaths today I know.
I live because I live. I do not die because I cannot die.
In Tuscan sunlight Masaccio
painted his belief that St. Peter’s shadow
cured a cripple, gave him back his sight.
I’ve come through eighty-five summers. I walk in sunlight.
In my garden, death questions every root, flowers reply.
I know the dark night of the soul
does not need God’s eye,
as a beggar does not need a hand or a bowl."
1095,High and Bright and Fine and Ice,Darcie Dennigan,"When the motorboat man asked me to love him
  
I whispered precipice
the word for the no-more-boyfriend feeling
  
because precipice contains ice (practically twice)
because I wanted teetering—
  
  
 What? he said
 Yes
  
His ears from the engines—so hard of hearing—his hands always
  so hot
 
 
Mid our first winter—I’d clung so long to the dock
he had to crowbar my fingers off
 
Each digit cracked so cleanly
Would you say they break like icicles? I asked sweetly
 
 
I knew I was nothing! But if I could sustain one song—
 I is, I is, I is I is I is
  
I could be: ice
 
 
Sex on the bathroom’s cold marble counter was best
I whispered statuette, monument
 
 What? he, sculpting my legs, said
 
 Yes
  
  
The child? I named her Cecily
It sounded like iced lily
 
 
For pure, I said pristine
At the ocean, I said brine
 
 Isle for vacation; for flowers, edelweiss
  
But when I said (only of late, late!) I choose ice
Brittle pearls broke behind my syllables
 
Did he hear me?
Again, twice, thrice:
 
For my love
we would need to live
in a great pyramid
We would need to sleep
beneath the continental shelf
with Antarctic crust blanketing us
The only driveway to any kind of house
is an iceberg-ridden Northwest Passage
When I whispered universe
you were to translate it as
 one bright line
 one bright rime"
1096,If a Garden of Numbers,Cole Swensen,"If a garden is the world counted
                                                           and found analogue in nature
One does not become two by ever ending
                                                                           so the stairs must be uneven in number
and not exceed
thirteen without a pause
of two paces’ width, which
                                                 for instance, the golden section
                            mitigates between abandon
and an orchestra just behind those trees,
gradations of green that take a stethoscope: we risk:
Length over width
                                  to make the horizon run straight
equals
            to make the pond an oval:
                                                            Width
                                                            over length minus the width
                              in which descending circles curl
into animals exact as a remainder.
 
                              Which means excess. The meaning of the real
always exceeds that of the ideal, said someone.
                                                                                      He was speaking of Vaux-le-Vicomte,
but it’s equally true of parking, or hunting, or wishing you could take it back. He
 
                              who is Allen Weiss, actually said, “The meaning
of a plastic or pictorial construct always surpasses the ideal meaning of that work.”
Which is something else entirely. Said
the axonometric
divided by
the anamorphic.
                               There is nothing that controls our thoughts
more than what we think we see,
which we label “we.”"
1097,Poets at Lunch,Stanley Moss,"to W.S. Merwin

I said, “Nothing for the last time.”
You said, “Everything for the last time.”
Later I thought you made everything more
precious with “everything for the last time”:
the last meditation, the last falling asleep,
the last dream before the final makebelieve,
the last kiss good night,
the last look out the window at the last moonlight.
Last leaves no time to hesitate.
I would drink strong coffee before my last sleep.
I’d rather remember childhood, rehearse forgiveness,
listen to birdsong or a Spanish housemaid singing,
scrubbing a tiled floor in Seville—
I’d scrub and sing myself. O Susanna
 Susanna, quanta pena mi costi.
I would strangle the snakes of lastness
like Herakles in his crib
before I cocked my ear to Mozart for the last time.
There is not sky or clouds enough to cover
the music I would hear for the last time.
I know a bank whereon the wild thyme of
everything for the last time grows, covered with
deadly nightshade and poison hemlock.
 
No last, no first, thinking in the moment,
years ago, you prepared the soil in Hawaii
before you planted your palm trees, then shared
most of your days and nights with them as equals.
You built your house with a Zen room.
I made no prayer when I dug a hole
and pushed in a twelve-foot white pine,
root ball locked in green plastic netting.
I did not cut the netting, so twenty years later
a tall, beautiful, white pine died.
I lynched the roots. To save my life
I would let them seize, cut out a bear’s heart,
I would partake in its flesh.
But you would die before you’d let them kill that bear.
Again, I say, “Nothing for the last time.”
You say, “Everything for the last time.”
Sailor, I would have killed a stranger
to save the world. Sailor, you would not.
We kissed goodbye on the cheek.
I hope not for the last time.
 
Home, I look into my brass telescope—
at the far end, where the moon and distant stars
should be, I see my eye looking back at me,
it’s twinkling and winking like a star. I go to bed.
My dogs, donkeys and wife are sleeping. I am safe.
You are home with your wife
you met and decided to marry in four days."

1099,I Too Have Been to Candyland,Anthony Madrid,"I TOO have been to Candyland, but I found myself missing the death cult.
I missed the spectacle of the wounded bones being opened and instrumented.
 
Bill Varner, when he was still just a boy, wrote a stunning line of Arabic verse.
He wrote: “The crescent moon is a scimitar; the sun, a severed head.”
 
 ¡Gran cantar! and this, when he still had to keep his books in a locker!
And he’d never even held hands with a girl—God! Penn State in the 1980s!
 
In those days, we all sat at the feet of a pig poet, deaf in one ear. One of these
Dreadful “white-haired lovers”—oh, but he knew how to touch fire to fuse!
  
That little stick of fire apt to launch a poetic career! But what is it now?
Merely a billowing cloud of humidity floating out of a tree.
  
Every turtle, snake, and bird is “born again”—oh, isn’t that so? The first time,
Out the fêted cloaca—and the next, through the top of the shell.
  
The “I” is Greek, the “it” Italian, and Dickinson is our Ghalib. But that
Ridiculous piece of dirt you’re kissing on can never be anything but.
  
Shut your eyes to what a worm he is, concentrate on his caress—but know
Every half-truth is bound to call up its suppressed synoptic double.
  
Close your eyes and moan softly, your head full of packed cotton—but know
Every hidden camera’s cockpit must one day be delivered of its black box."
1100,In the Bakery,Darcie Dennigan,"for Tim

It was in August, such a lovely summer, that I began the massacring.
The flower killing. Feeding the sunflowers to the industrial dough mixer.
 
Soon there was enough yellow petal pulp for twelve loaves.
 
For twelve times ten loaves.
 
For twelve hundred loaves.
 
 
One of the food critics in town came around to inquire about my baking system.
. . . I glanced at the machete, propped next to the ovens.
 
 
Toward October (and what auburn weather!), I still felt
 it, the substance of the soul, the libidinal terrible whatever.
  
I sat out back with the two countergirls, Haley and Shayla. There was one cigarette,
and we were sharing.
  
 Mourning is the horizon of all desire, we were commiserating.
  
  
But Haley and Shayla, they’re—
  
They sell Kaiser rolls and sliced Sicilian and then they leave and put on a fancy tanktop
and go out for the evening.
  
They go even though—
  
The little white clematis cling to the fences.
  
(At dawn the buds were dying as a sweet white bread was rising.)
  
  
November
How beautiful were the yellow mums in the thin wintry sun!
The bread they made had the hue of golden potatoes.
  
  
December
Specks of red in lit windows: amaryllis
that I stole and slaughtered and sold inside a pain de mie roll.
  
  
I love how in the cold, my breath flowers before me.
  
January, February
I hacked through the ice to get at flower fetuses. The breads were very seedy.
  
  
Spring
It was really beginning.
  
Baguettes made entirely of white peonies.
  
Brioche from the blood of purple lilacs.
  
Long lines outside the bakery’s door . . .
  
  
 What is the secret ingredient?
I confessed: Flower. Flowers! Please, put me away. I am desperate.
 
 
Summer
I could not go through another.
 
The woodbine had barely begun and already the mornings were full of the scent of
them.
 
 
Not one honeysuckle would go unsucked—unless—
 
 
I closed the doors (every season is too full of longing!) and rechristened myself Flora.
I drank a vat of rose water and put both my wrists through the slicer.
 
And then I began to bleed—a white powder.
Flour.
 
 
And then you came in.
I would have known you even if you were not wearing in your  buttonhole a carnation.
 
 
 The bakery is closed, I said tersely.
I was bleeding profusely.
  
  
I loved you even before you said
 Nothing breaks more slowly, more silently, than bread.
  
  
With my blood pouring out as a fine, dry flour
let me confess before I expire.
  
  
There on the counter, in that vase
fresh and pink is the corsage I was keeping for our dance."
1101,The Milk One,Anthony Madrid,"HE has no gift for friendship, for he is void of all curiosity. Or rather,
He’s only interested in matters touching the Lord Hamlet himself.
  
He was born in a lab whose walls were lined with giant, steamy jars
Of the milk of the various mammals, from the milk of camels to the milk of men.
  
Pig milk, monkey milk, rat milk. Dog and cat milk, and the milk of whales.
The milk of the duck-billed platypus and that | of the platitudinous buck.
  
The thick red milk of the vampire bat. And the black milk of the black bear.
—A backlit wall of bottles, ranged from commonplace to rare!—
  
There was stallion milk and rooster, anaconda milk and shark;
There was tarantula milk, Venus flytrap, and that | of the barking aardvark lark.
  
And he would have been perfectly normal, would have grown up socially adroit,
But he stripped the sheet off a drinking straw, took a blade, and shaped a point;—
  
And he syringed into his body a few drops from every jar,
Fell in the floor and spoke languages he had never heard before.
  
He spoke Titmouse. He spoke Miaow. He spoke Moo and Gnu and Ha.
He spoke three kinds of Chickenhawk and the thirty dialects of Baa.
  
And from that day to this, MARDUD’s been lost in the zoo:
A cautionary tale for whoever knows how to read the clues."

1103,The Youngest Living Thing in L.A.,Darcie Dennigan,"The youngest living thing in L. A. was my baby.
The oldest living thing was the wind.
 
The wind grew well in that city in the desert.
As did my garden of well-tended cement.
As did my baby, whom I held like a heavy statuette.
 
 
I named him Mill at his birth  . . .  As the wheel goeth by drift of water . . .
 
 
And he grew and the wind blew and we lived in that desert and . . . no rain. No rain, no river. No sound of water. But for—
 
The fountain water.
 
The official fountain. Which flowed. Every day. Every day the baby slept. The baby breathed. The fountain flowed. It flowed imperceptibly. As if its water were fast asleep.
 
 
We stood on the fountain’s shore: woman + newborn.
We made one totem.
I named the baby Easter Island.
 
 
We played I Spy.

 
I saw: coins at the fountain’s bottom. Eyes. Copper cataracts, winking through the water at us.
 
 
I held the baby close. I held the baby stiffly. I brought the baby to see nobody.
 
 
I saw: statues in the fountain’s water. Statues in tall grasses on the shore of a sea. I turned to tell somebody. The city had disappeared into complete silence. There was only: the baby.
 
 
We were watching the water wrinkle in the wind.
In the distance, maids were ironing.
 
 
Overhead: jets drew ciphers in the blue with their chalk.
 
 The drift of the maker is dark.
  
  
 Beware that by the drifts thou perish not.
  
The statues, the statues in the strange fountain were looking at us. They were weeping and turning, turning and weeping.
 
They might have seen the city shimmering in the sun and wind, and known . . . It was a city with no one in it. If a door somewhere on the street opened, it would always be . . . no one.
 
It would be a bad draft that had blossomed.
 
 
I longed for meadows white with drifts of snow. I named the baby Drift.
 
In the winter I had planned to bring him north. To a barn’s eaves, to hear icicles drip. To prepare him to grow up in the path of the next great glacial drift.
 
 
City whose sky was white jet streaks.
 
Whose houses were apparitions of asbestos flakes.
 
Whose homeless sipped wind from tins.
 
 
Whose only water was the strange fountain.
 
 
 Angel, my angel, my sweetheart, wake up. See the foam on the wave, see the tornado, the hurricane.
  
  
We stood on the fountain’s shore. The wind blew particulates of rug powder, of lemon-scented floor polish. The maids of the city were cleaning so completely.
 
And mutely.
 
There may have been other names I gave the baby.
 Zeno sweet Zeno
  
 Little fellow little fellow
  
 Vertigo
  
  
I said to the baby, We will stand here until there is snow on the mountain.
  
I may have meant to say fountain.
  
We peered all day into the strange fountain.
  
  
I said to myself, That is just your face stiffening around your cheeks. That is just grass growing at your feet.
  
  
I held the baby all the time, and he never ever cried."
1104,Album — A Runthru,Clark Coolidge,"I look in that one kind of dwindled. And in this,
look up, a truncheon in my fist, tin pot
on my head, the war. My father, I’m looking at, is my
age then and thin, his pants streak to the ground,
shadows of rosevines . . . His father sits beneath
a cat. Here the shadow has more flavor than my
trains, elbows on livingroom floor, bangs that
curl, opera broadcast, The Surreptitious Adventures of
Nightstick. I lie in the wind of the sun and hear
toots and smell aluminium smoke. The tiny oval
of my mother’s youth in back and the rest is dark.
Sundays, the floor was black. At the beach, here
I’m a nest of seaweed, an earlier portrait of
surrealists I saw later, a stem of grey what
rises from my scalp. My hair is peaked in brine.
And this here hat, dark green fedora over same green
corduroy suit for a trip to the nation’s capitol,
how far askance I’ve been since and never another
hat. Cromium rods, the hand in the guide’s pocket
seems far removed. Blurry shoes on sandstone steps,
double and over exposed. Then in this one the SECRET
points to my head, shaved, and emblem, OPEN, striped
in “pirate” T-shirt and HERE IT IS. My elbow bent,
upright this time, behind a pole. I had yet to
enter at this snap the cavern beneath my sneakers.
To the right my soles protrude from beneath a boulder,
for I had trapped my mother and she asked Why.
Taken. Given. Flashlight brighter than my face,
another grotto, where the ball of twine, indirection,
gave out but we never got very far in, Connecticut.
I swim out of another cave in a further frame, cramped
gaze of sunlit days, apparel forgot. Later I reel
in a yell as my cousin takes a bite from my shank
beneath ranchhouse breezy curtains of Marion. On a trudge up
from the gasoline rockpit in the gaze of Judy Lamb,
she carries my pack, my jeans rolled as I step on
a pipe. Estwing in hand and svelte as only youthful can.
Most of those rocks remain and she married a so-so
clarinetist. My greygreen zipper jacket leans against
a concrete teepee, my father looking bullchested stands
before. Perhaps we had just argued. Central Park cement
steps of pigeons, the snow removed. Overexposed
whiteshirt at the drums, stick fingers ride cymbal
at the camera raised, livingroom Brenton with orange
& black “sea” wallpaper and orange&black tubs. I wore
a wristwatch then and never again, drumtime hitching
me past it. I graduate from highschool in white dinner
jacket and diploma and frown, too many hot shadows
back of the garage. Must roll up the bedroll with
skinny arms and lam for the caves. Dave & A. Bell by
the Ford Company Squire first time allowed alone to tool
Bleak grass scapes of Knox farm. Rope down a crack,
mosquitoes and Koolade, sun dapple leaf moss sandwiches, ache.
Then in this group more drums on the roof, the gravel
and the flat, a cover attempt for no album even thought.
I tap and step in the dim known street. Lean on a
chimney to inhabit the sky, deep with drops. Here
I’m pressed on a wall of Tennessee limes, stones-throw
from mouth of the underground we camped in. Too many
thoughts, elide. Then lie on a beach in a doughnut
pattern shirt with a stick, a pipe?, in my mouth as my
cousin grins shiny beyond. Truro, also waiting for the
caves. With the poets then I’m fat and the driveway is
dark, the clapboards all white in a day of all talk.
This then all ends in color, my red bandana and shirt out
on Devil’s Pulpit, open hand addressed to the grey
where Hawthorne and Melville now view of a highschool.
While the water still spills, and the cat squints at leaves
blown, my father wears Brahms, families lean in on one
for a group shot, and the rock remains shattered in a star."

the one thing removed overemphasizes tonally

1106,Blues for Alice,Clark Coolidge,"When you get in on a try you never learn it back
umpteen times the tenth part of a featured world
in black and in back it’s roses and fostered nail
bite rhyme sling slang, a song that teaches without
travail of the tale, the one you longing live

It’s insane to remain a trope, of a rinsing out

in her rhythm
that knowledge is past all of us, so we flare and tap
and top it right up, constant engage and flap in on
keeping pace, our whelming rift, and soil and gleam
and give back the voice, like those eary dead
 
Step down off our whelm lessons and shortly fired
enter the bristle strum of Corrosion Kingdom
where the last comes by first ever ring, every
race through that tunnel of sun drop and pencil
in the margins of a flare, of higher wish than dare,
the stroked calmings of a line will spin and chime
in blue quicks of a dream blues, the chores
of those whispering gone crenulations
 
To meet a care is to dial redeem
and we limp in the time sound balms
so out of kilter is my name in the sun, and I win
in the moon and you sing in that other spelling of win
the way a blue is never singular"
1107,But It Says Nothing,Clark Coolidge,"But it says nothing. And one is as quiet
as if to say nothing moves me. Then
there is the chair. And one speaks of
the chair sitting at the table.
Scraping against surfaces, opening the mouth.
The object is a piece of thing before. One
shifts in a chair and opens the talk.
And the time it says nothing one moves.
The table is too long as the wall. Not
a thing but it stays and one opens
as a mouth will begin. Speaking of
the table, nothing but to avoid that of
the wall. One could return over and over
to the chair, the wall one is sitting at.
Least ways it says nothing. And the
thing is, it stays still before
speaking of. The object of nothing, even
speech."
1108,The Country Autumns,Clark Coolidge,"But it could not be brought to see what it
could be brought. And the leaves are
away again, teamed. A parent at the
last and a parent in the middle. And
as stones I thought it right.

Two plates, and on the other side all the
forest pieces. The clock says stay.
The books lower the earth, and in gardens
flat stones spin. The volume was of waiting.
Today is today, until the preposition taken up.
Next to the tree sways.
 
The sky in pieces the leaves part the
leaves piece together. To and from a hand
given all directions. The bark comes from
below. Takes from the books of the moves under
the sky. Speaker holds up the talks held last.
Motors the dust and the yellow syllables.
A slant on which was never here or
only partly."
1109,The Fall Returns,Clark Coolidge,"the rooms are chosen, then they move on
the beads are wetted in the lime
the weedlot boils in the blood of one eye
the children first are cankered then they spin
 

there are not routes, only dials
the rocks are spun together in one ball
the laundry is of rust, the pillow shrieks
pianos all blow northward and return

 
must be a bath if  I could find it is a map
of all the ways that center intermission
skulls are simply caps for all compression
day’s light raising closets for its dark

 
I put up the clothes and trail the keys
that onyx knob in vacuum turns the train
pressure on the pitches swaying back again
a world without a heartbeat but it stays"
1110,They Say It’s New,Clark Coolidge,"He crackles the air in big fist
because it is turning, the night’s spine
and the fast floor of last year is now the wall of this
 
Those cracks should be flowers but there is no light
nor lights in the windless binnacle strewn
a slow rate of thought in the broad attention
 
What is shorn to say and then to leave
awake in the sleep, the pen without its cap
the numbers that will harm if not arrayed
 
The windows are not blank, the dark not empty
but solid as the mask held loose before
the eyeless active ridden hive
 
The sounds of the mind entire are
the wind below at the valley floor then a thumping above
as of rocks at work painting the wall
 
Turn out the lights and think invisibly
stain the turn of time
and hear the year before it’s there"
1111,In Childhood,Sarah A. Chavez,"In childhood Christy and I played in the dumpster across the street
from Pickett & Sons Construction. When we found bricks, it was best.
Bricks were most useful. We drug them to our empty backyard
and stacked them in the shape of a room. For months
we collected bricks, one on top another. When the walls
reached as high as my younger sister’s head, we laid down.
Hiding in the middle of our room, we watched the cycle
of the sun, gazed at the stars, clutched hands and felt at home."
1112,Love Poem for Ted Neeley In Jesus Christ Superstar,Carrie Shipers,"Lincoln, Neb., 2009
 
 That man’s too old to play Christ, someone said
when you appeared onstage—thirty years
in those white robes, spotlights tracking
your graceful sleeves, the attentive angle
of your head as you worked a crowd. I agreed
that you looked tired, but when Mary Magdalene
anointed you, when you cast merchants
and money changers from the temple, I forgot
your thinning hair and wrinkled brow, forgot
how your story ended: your broken voice
crying on the cross, your body arched as you
ascended. I’d lost track of how many songs
were in the second act, thought there might
be more—the empty tomb, your appearance
on the road, to Peter in Jerusalem—but the cast
came out for applause: soldiers, Apostles,
and women; Annas, Caiaphas, Pilate; Mary
in her red dress; Peter, that sturdy fisherman;
Judas, who has all the best songs; and finally
you, head bowed at our ovation. I didn’t come
to worship but you’ve left me no choice—
I don’t care how old you are, how many times
you’ve done this act before—you still rock
those power ballads, still heal with the same
sweet force before you rise. We’ll always want
too much from you. Tonight, I’ll believe until
the curtain closes, your tour bus rolls away."

1115,Asters,Gottfried Benn,"Asters—sweltering days
old adjuration/curse,
the gods hold the balance
for an uncertain hour.

Once more the golden flocks
of heaven, the light, the trim—
what is the ancient process
hatching under its dying wings?

Once more the yearned-for,
the intoxication, the rose of you—
summer leaned in the doorway
watching the swallows—

one more presentiment
where certainty is not hard to come by:
wing tips brush the face of the waters,
swallows sip speed and night."
1116,from “An Attempt at Jealousy”,Marina Tsvetaeva,"How is your life with that other one?
Simpler, is it? A stroke of the oars
and a long coastline—
and the memory of me

is soon a drifting island
(not in the ocean—in the sky!)
Souls—you will be sisters—
sisters, not lovers.

How is your life with an ordinary
woman? without the god inside her?
The queen supplanted—

How do you breathe now?
Flinch, waking up?
What do you do, poor man?

“Hysterics and interruptions—
enough! I’ll rent my own house!”
How is your life with that other,
you, my own.

Is the breakfast delicious?
(If you get sick, don’t blame me!)
How is it, living with a postcard?
You who stood on Sinai.

How’s your life with a tourist
on Earth? Her rib (do you love her?)
is it to your liking?

How’s life? Do you cough?
Do you hum to drown out the mice in your mind?

How do you live with cheap goods: is the market rising?
How’s kissing plaster-dust?

Are you bored with her new body?
How’s it going, with an earthly woman,
with no sixth sense?

                                                         Are you happy?
No? In a shallow pit—how is your life,
my beloved? Hard as mine
with another man?

1117,Bound for Hell,Marina Tsvetaeva,"Hell, my ardent sisters, be assured,
Is where we’re bound; we’ll drink the pitch of hell—
We, who have sung the praises of the lord
With every fiber in us, every cell.

We, who did not manage to devote
Our nights to spinning, did not bend and sway
Above a cradle—in a flimsy boat,
Wrapped in a mantle, we’re now borne away.

Every morning, every day, we’d rise
And have the finest Chinese silks to wear;
And we’d strike up the songs of paradise
Around the campfire of a robbers’ lair,

We, careless seamstresses (our seams all ran,
Whether we sewed or not)—yet we have been
Such dancers, we have played the pipes of Pan:
The world was ours, each one of us a queen.

First, scarcely draped in tatters, and disheveled,
Then plaited with a starry diadem;
We’ve been in jails, at banquets we have reveled:
But the rewards of heaven, we’re lost to them,

Lost in nights of starlight, in the garden
Where apple trees from paradise are found.
No, be assured, my gentle girls, my ardent
And lovely sisters, hell is where we’re bound."
1118,Caryatid,Gottfried Benn,"Renege on the rock! Smash
the oppressor cave! Sashay
out onto the floor! Scorn the cornices—
see, from the beard of drunk Silenus
from the unique uproar of his blood
the wine dribble into his genitals!

Spit on the obsession with pillars:
ancient rheumatic hands quake toward
gray skies. Bring down the temple
by the yearning of your knees
twitching with dance.

Spill, spread, unpetal, bleed
your soft flowers through great wounds.
Dove-hauled Venus girds her loins
with roses—
see the summer’s last puff of blue
drift on seas of asters to distant
pine-brown coasts; see
this final hour of our mendacious
southern happiness   
held aloft."
1119,The Day of Gifts,Paul Claudel,"It’s not true that Your saints have won everything: they left me with sins enough.
Someday I’ll lie on my deathbed, Lord, ill-shaven and yellow as a lifelong drunk.
And I’ll make a general examination of myself, looking back over all my days,
And I’ll see that I’m rich after all, ripe and rich with evil in its unnumbered paths and ways.
I haven’t lost one single chance, Lord, to make matter for You to pardon.
Now I hearten myself with vice, having long ago sloughed off virtue’s burden.
Each day has its own kind of crime, plain to see, and I count them like some paranoid miser.

If what you need, Lord, are virgins, if what you need are brave men beneath your standard;
If there are people for whom to be Christian words alone would not suffice,
But who know rather that only in stirring themselves to chase after You is there any life,
Well then there’s Dominic and Francis, Saint Lawrence and Saint Cecilia and plenty more!
But if by chance You should have need of a lazy and imbecilic bore,
If a prideful coward could prove useful to You, or perhaps a soiled ingrate,
Or the sort of man whose hard heart shows up in a hard face—
Well, anyway, You didn’t come to save the just but that other type that abounds,
And if, miraculously, You run out of them elsewhere . . . Lord, I’m still around.

And what kind of a man is so crude that he hasn’t held a little something back from You,
Hasn’t in his free time fashioned something special for You,
Hoping that one day the idea will come to You to ask it of him,
And maybe this little that he’s made himself, kept back until then, though horrid and tortuous, will please Your whim.
It would be something that he’d put his whole heart into, something useless and malformed.
Just like that my little daughter once, on my birthday, teetered forward with encumbered arms
And offered me, her heart at once full of timidity and pride,
A magnificent little duck she had made with her own two hands, a pincushion, made of red wool and gold thread."
1120,from “The Desk”,Marina Tsvetaeva,"Fair enough: you people have eaten me,
I—wrote you down.
They’ll lay you out on a dinner table,
me—on this desk.

I’ve been happy with little.
There are dishes I’ve never tried.
But you, you people eat slowly, and often;
You eat and eat.

Everything was decided for us
back in the ocean:
Our places of action,
our places of gratitude.

You—with belches, I—with books,
with truffles, you. With pencil, I,
you and your olives, me and my rhyme,
with pickles, you. I, with poems.

At your head—funeral candles
like thick-legged asparagus:
your road out of this world
a dessert table’s striped cloth.

They will smoke Havana cigars
on your left side and your right;
your body will be dressed
in the best Dutch linen.

And—not to waste such expensive cloth,
they will shake you out,
along with the crumbs and bits of food,
into the hole, the grave.

You—stuffed capon, I—pigeon.
Gunpowder, your soul, at the autopsy.
And I will be laid out bare
with only two wings to cover me.

has it by a neck."
1122,Each Day,Peter Cole,"Each day as dawn approaches,
the King sits in majesty
and blesses the holy creatures:
To you, my creatures, I speak,
before you I declare—
Creatures who bear the throne of my glory
with all your heart, and willingly with your soul—
Blessed is the hour of your creation,
and exalted is the constellation
beneath which I gave you form.
May the light of that morning continue to shine
when you came into my mind—
for you are a vessel of my desire
prepared and perfected on that day.
Be silent, creatures of my making,
so I might hear my children pray."

You don’t need always to be scrubbing the tiles, Hendrickje,
my eye drinks itself,
drinks itself to death—
but other drink is in short supply—
the little Buddha there,
Chinese grove god
in exchange for a ladleful of Hulstkamp,
please!

Never painted anything
in frost-white or ice-skater blue
or that Irish green
in which the purple shimmers through—
always my own monotone,
my compulsion to shadows—
not pleasant
to pursue that path so clearly.

Greatness—where?
I pick up the slate-pencil and certain things appear
on paper or canvas
or whatever the heck else—
result: Buddha bronze hocked for booze—
but I draw the line at homage under ornamental plants,
banquet of the painters’ guild—
something for the boardroom!

...Creaking,
little sheep squeaking, chromotypes
Flemish, Rubensish—
for the grandchildren
(same idiots!)
Ah—Hulstkamp,
hits the spot,
midpoint of colors,
my shadow brown,
stubble aura around heart and eye—

The blocked chimney smokes
—the Swan of Avon blows his nose—
the tree stumps are wet,
clammy night, emptiness mingled with draft—
enough characters,
the world is overpopulated as it is,
plentiful peach-fall, four rosebuds
per annum—
asperged,
set to tread the boards
by this hand,
grown wrinkled
and with sluggish veins!

All the Juliets and Ophelias,
wreathed, silvered, sometimes murderous—
all the soft mouths, the sighs
I extracted from them—
the original actresses long since turned to smoke,
rust, leeched dry, rats’ pudding—
Ariel too, away with the elements.

The age takes off its frockcoat.
These lousy skulls of lords,
their trains of thought
that I pushed into extremes—
my lords makers of history
all of them crowned and sceptered illiterates,
great powers of the cosmos—
yes, like so many bats or kites!

Sir Goon wrote to me lately:
“the rest is silence”—
I think that’s one of mine,
could only be mine,
Dante dead—lacuna
of centuries
to my logomachic quotes—

what if they didn’t exist,
the booty never brought to light,
the booths, the scaffolds, the cymbals
never clashed—
gaps? Gap teeth maybe,
but the great monkey jaws
would grind on
emptiness, mingled with draft—
the tree stumps are wet
and the butler snores in porter dreams."

1126,From Whose Beauty the Depths Are Lit,Peter Cole,"When one stands before the throne of glory, he begins reciting
the hymn that the throne of glory sings each day:

King of kings,
God of gods
and Lord of lords,
encircled by braided branches of crowns—
encompassed by branching commanders of radiance—
who covers the heavens with wings of His splendor
and in His majesty appears on high;
from whose beauty the depths are lit,
whose glory flashes across the sky—
proud envoys shoot forth from His form,
powerful creatures explode from His crown,
and princes course from the folds of His robe.
All the trees rejoice at His word
as the grasses delight in His joy—
and His words pour forth as fragrance
in flames of issued fire,
proffering pleasure to those who search them
and peace to those who make them live."

Sons of the Palace—
        you who yearn
to behold the radiance
        of the Lesser Presence—

be seated here
        at this Sabbath table,
adorned and crowned
        with the name of the King.

Exult in your being
        part of this gathering
among the guardian
        angels’ wings,

and rejoice now
        within this hour
of favor which knows
        not what anger brings.

Draw near me here—
        see my power,
without the judgments
        of judgment’s terror.

Those without
        may not enter,
for they are dogs
        of rancor and gall.

I hereby call
        to the Ancient of Days
to summon His will
        to drive them away—

for when His favor
        in this room is shown,
the husks are rendered
        null and void.

He drives them into
        holes in the ground,
conceals them deep
        in caverns of stone.

And so it is
        now and till twilight—
within the Impatient

1131,Left the House,Gottfried Benn,"I

Left the house shattered, it hurt so bad,
so many years as a man, compromise,
in spite of partial success in intellectual tussle
he was never anyone of Olympian allure.

He walked slowly through the dreamscape
of the late autumn day, barely distinguishable
from early spring, with young willows
and a patch of waste ground where blue jays screamed.

Dreamy exposure to phenomena
that to nature in its administration
of various cycles—young and old alike—
are inseparably part of a single order—:

so he drank his gin and accepted a dish
of sausage soup, free on Thursdays
with a beverage and so found the Olympian balance
of sorrow and pleasure.

                                              II

He had been reading on the park bench
and stared into the gray of the last roses,
there were no titans, just shrubs
thinned out by fall.

He put down his book. It was a day like any other
and the people were like all people everywhere,
that was how it would always be, at least
this mixture of death and laughter would persist.

A scent is enough to change things,
even small flowers stand in some relation to a cedar of Lebanon,
then he walked on and saw the windows of the furriers
were full of warm things for the winter ahead.

                                              III

All very well, a gin and a few minutes
in the park at noon, with the sun shining,
but what when the landlord comes by, there are problems
with your tax return, and the girlfriend’s in tears?

Shattered: how far are you allowed to push your I,
and see peculiar things as somehow symptomatic?
Shattered: to what extent are you obliged to play by the rules—
as far as a Ludwig Richter canvas?

Shattered: no one knows. Shattered and you turn
equally pained to singular and universal—
your little experiment with destiny will end
gloriously and forever, but quite alone.

Damned evergreens! Vinyl whines!
Gin, sun, cedars—what use are they
to help the self reconcile landlord, God, and dream—
voices warble and words mock—
left the house and closed his reverie."
1132,A Life,Edith Södergran,"That the stars are adamant
everyone understands—
but I won’t give up seeking joy on each blue wave
or peace below every gray stone.
If happiness never comes, what is a life?
A lily withers in the sand
and if its nature has failed? The tide
                                         washes the beach at night.
What is the fly looking for on the spider’s web?
What does a dayfly make of its hours?
(Two wings creased over a hollow body.)

Black will never turn to white—
yet the perfume of our struggle lingers
as each morning fresh flowers
spring up from hell.

The day will come
when the earth is emptied, the skies collapse
and all goes still—
when nothing remains but the dayfly
                                         folded in a leaf.
But no one knows it."
1133,Lips,Eugene Dubnov,"What is the structure of lips
That take care of sounds,
That can scream loud and long,
That can wait and be silent?

And kissing lips lightly—
Their loving weakness
Now remains on my own
Hardworking lips,
Exacting, as if forever,
My terrible punishment."
1134,Music Box,Jorge Luis Borges,"Music of Japan. Parsimoniously
from the water clock the drops unfold
in lazy honey or ethereal gold
that over time reiterates a weave
eternal, fragile, enigmatic, bright.
I fear that every one will be the last.
They are a yesterday come from the past.
But from what shrine, from what mountain’s slight
garden, what vigils by an unknown sea,
and from what modest melancholy, from
what lost and rediscovered afternoon
do they arrive at their far future: me?
Who knows? No matter. When I hear it play
I am. I want to be. I bleed away."
1135,Now it is fall,Edith Södergran,"when all the golden birds
fly home across the blue deep water;

                                                       glitter;
departure rustles through the trees.
This farewell is vast and separation draws close,
but reunion, that also is certain.

My head on my arm I fall asleep easily.
On my eyes a mother’s breath,
from her mouth to my heart:
sleep, child, and dream now the sun is gone.—"
1136,The Nut Garden,Yosef Gikatilla,"The Nut Garden holds things felt and thought
and feeling for thought is always a palace—

Sinai with flames of fire about it,
burning though never by fire devoured.

entrance is barred to pretenders forever.

For one who learns to be wise, however,
its doors are open toward the East:

he reaches out and takes a nut,
then cracks its shell, and eats..."

1138,from “Poems for Blok”,Marina Tsvetaeva,"Your name is a—bird in my hand,
a piece of ice on my tongue.
The lips’ quick opening.
Your name—four letters.

a silver bell in my mouth.

A stone thrown into a silent lake
is—the sound of your name.
The light click of hooves at night
—your name.
Your name at my temple
—sharp click of a cocked gun.

Your name—impossible—
kiss on my eyes,
the chill of closed eyelids.
Your name—a kiss of snow.
Blue gulp of icy spring water.
With your name—sleep deepens.

And Spassky Gates—and gates, and gates—
where the Orthodox take off their hats;

And the Chapel of Stars—refuge chapel—
where the floor is—polished by tears;

Take the circle of the five cathedrals,
my coal, my soul; the domes wash us in their darkgold,

And on your shoulders, from the red clouds,

And you will rise, happened of wonderpowers

took mountains—and took their entrails,
they took coal, and steel they took,
they took lead, and crystal.

they took the beehive, and took the haystack,
they took the South from us, and the East.

impossible to forget.

No doubt,
as day breaks,
they see the buildings
where they wish
they could live with their children.

They
can steady the coffin
of a constellation on their shoulders.
They can wreck
the air like furious birds,
blocking out the sun.

But not knowing these gifts,
they enter and exit through mirrors of blood,
walking and dying slowly.

And so,
one cannot forget them."

Send the dew of blessing, the dew of grace;
renew my dispensation, and grant me length of days.

Bring light to my eyes with your teaching, and let not the husks

1147,"To my Comrade, Moses J. Jackson, Scoffer at this Scholarship",A. E. Housman,"As we went walking far and wide
Through silent fields and countryside,
We watched together star signs brim
And rise above the ocean’s rim,
And planets too, that fret with light
The icy caverns of the Night.
These constellations we now mark,
When we were not, in formless dark,
A poet, centuries before,
Would watch from the Italian shore
Drop in the sea, and mindful Earth
Had made him mortal from his birth,
He set on high his music’s bars
Among the everlasting stars,
To those to come, clear warning sign
To place no faith in the divine;
For sacred to the pole unfurled
Above, and compassing the world,
These songs yet suffered sad disgrace
And almost sank without a trace:
Though to our strand this wreckage came,
It scarcely owned its author’s name.
Mine not to exhort the gods
Or stars that vex our mortal odds,
But love of virtue quick to fade
Makes me seek fame with human aid.
A man, I chose a man to stand
At this front page and my right hand—
Who thrive or perish in my pages,
Brief friend, your name should last the ages.
I send these lines to you who went
Where stars rise in the Orient,
From here where constellations sink
Below the ocean’s western brink.
Take them: for that day will come
To add us to the canceled sum
And give our bones to earth to rot
(For we have no immortal lot,
And souls that will not last forever)
And the chain of comrades sever."

his brevity? A marble slab is saved
for you, one you won’t read, already graved
with city, epitaph, dates of the dead.
And other men are also dreams of time,
not hardened bronze, purified gold. They’re dust
like you; the universe is Proteus.

1150,“Where does such tenderness come from?”,Marina Tsvetaeva,"Where does such tenderness come from?
These aren’t the first curls
I’ve wound around my finger—
I’ve kissed lips darker than yours.

The sky is washed and dark
(Where does such tenderness come from?)
Other eyes have known
and shifted away from my eyes.

But I’ve never heard words like this
in the night
(Where does such tenderness come from?)
with my head on your chest, rest.

Where does this tenderness come from?
And what will I do with it? Young
stranger, poet, wandering through town,
you and your eyelashes—longer than anyone’s.

1151,Where Will I Find You,Yehudah Halevi,"Where, Lord, will I find you:
your place is high and obscured.
         And where
               won’t I find you:
         your glory fills the world.

You dwell deep within—
          you’ve fixed the ends of creation.
You stand, a tower for the near,
          refuge to those far off.
You’ve lain above the Ark, here,
          yet live in the highest heavens.
          Exalted among your hosts,
          although beyond their hymns—
                no heavenly sphere
                      could ever contain you,
          let alone a chamber within.

In being borne above them
          on an exalted throne,
you are closer to them
          than their breath and skin.
Their mouths bear witness for them,
          that you alone gave them form.
          Your kingdom’s burden is theirs;
          who wouldn’t fear you?
                And who could fail
                      to search for you—
          who sends down food when it is due?

I sought your nearness.
          With all my heart I called you.
And in my going out to meet you,
          I found you coming toward me,
as in the wonders of your might
          and holy works I saw you.
          Who would say he hasn’t seen
          your glory as the heavens’
                hordes declare
                      their awe of you
          without a sound being heard?

But could the Lord, in truth,
          dwell in men on earth?
How would men you made
          from the dust and clay
fathom your presence there,
          enthroned upon their praise?
          The creatures hovering over
          the world praise your wonders—
                your throne borne high
                      above their heads,
          as you bear all forever."
1152,Alteration Finds,Geoffrey Brock,"1. DELIRIUM, AFTER RIMBAUD

How many hours I kept
that vigil by your side—
entire nights, eyes wide,
as you so sweetly slept.

What I was wondering:
why you yearned to evade
the real. No one has prayed
harder for anything.

It wasn’t for your life
I feared, but for mankind.
Did you, in the end, find
secrets for changing life?

2. DEFACED, AFTER RILKE

The head we cannot know,
nor its bright fruit, the eyes.
And yet the body has
its gaze: a lamp turned low.

Or else the breast would cease
to dazzle, the hips fail
to curve into that smile
that begets more than a kiss.

And flesh would lose all life,
not flare till there’s no blind
it can’t see you behind.
You must change your life.

3. DENIAL, AFTER SEFERIS

The afternoon grew hotter
along our secret shore.
We thirsted in the glare
but couldn’t drink the water.

On golden sand we traced
your name beside the sea.
The wind came like a sigh;
our writing was erased.

How passionate our life,
how full of sex and song,
spirit and heart—how wrong!
And so we changed our life."
1153,Express Train,Gottfried Benn,"Brown. Brandy-brown. Leaf-brown. Russet.
Malayan yellow.
Express train Berlin-Trelleborg and the Baltic resorts.

Flesh that went naked.
Tanned unto the mouth by the sea.
Deeply ripened for Grecian joys.
How far along the summer, in sickle-submissiveness!
Penultimate day of the ninth month!

Parched with stubble and the last corn-shocks.
Unfurlings, blood, fatigue,
deranged by dahlia-nearness.

Man-brown jumps on woman-brown.

A woman is something for a night.
And if you enjoyed it, then the next one too!
O! And then the return to one’s own care.
The not-speaking! The urges!

A woman is something with a smell.
Ineffable! To die for! Mignonette.
Shepherd, sea, and South.
On every declivity a bliss.

Woman-brown drapes itself on man-brown:

Hold me! I’m falling!
My neck is so weary.
Oh, the sweet last
fevered scent from the gardens."
1154,Fish Fry Daughter,Sara Ries,"Holiday Inn kitchen, the day I am born:
My father is frying fish for a party of seventeen
when the call comes from the hospital. He stays
until the batter is crispy, cold salads scooped
on platters, rye bread buttered.
 
Dad never told me this story.
He told my boyfriend, one short order cook to another.
Mom doesn’t know why Dad was late
for her screams and sweat on the hospital bed.
 
Once, when she was angry with him, she told me:
When your father finally got there, the nurse had to tell
him to get upstairs, “Your wife is having that baby now.”
 
I hope that when Dad first held me,
it was with haddock-scented hands, apron
over his black pants still sprinkled with flour,
forehead oily from standing over the deep fryer,
telling the fish to hurry  hurry."
1155,Second Tour,Penelope Scambly Schott,"While my husband packed to fly back to Vietnam,
this time as a tourist instead of a soldier,

I drove to the zoo to say goodbye to the musk oxen
who were being shipped out early next morning

to Tacoma. We were getting lions instead.
When I got there, it was too easy to park.

The zoo was closing early so they wouldn’t let me in.
I went back to my car and slid into the driver’s seat.

Sobs tore from deep in my chest, I who had never
seen a musk ox and never cared until now."
1156,All Hallows’ Eve,Dorothea Tanning,"Be perfect, make it otherwise.
Yesterday is torn in shreds.
Lightning’s thousand sulfur eyes
Rip apart the breathing beds.
Hear bones crack and pulverize.
Doom creeps in on rubber treads.
Countless overwrought housewives,
Minds unraveling like threads,
Try lipstick shades to tranquilize
Fears of age and general dreads.
Sit tight, be perfect, swat the spies,
Don’t take faucets for fountainheads.
Drink tasty antidotes. Otherwise
You and the werewolf: newlyweds."
1157,Coming to That,Dorothea Tanning,"“If it comes to that,” he said, “there’ll be no
preventing it.”
He uttered it as I listened. Had I got it right,
hearing him?
“If it comes to that,” is what he said, and,
as if talking
to himself, went on about how there’d be no
preventing it.
He came to that conclusion, saying it in a
slow way of
coming to that, whatever that was it might
come to before
not being prevented—and as if such a thing
were for him
the unthinkable, and would prevail, if it
came to that.
 
And while listening more closely now to
what he said,
I realized if no one paid him heed, it would
be as if he
hadn’t said it—if it came to that—and would
then not be
prevented from falling to forces known to
care little for
what he said, even if they heard it, their
being wily
and forceful enough to make sure it would
come to that."
1158,Lucky,Dorothea Tanning,"Ever imagining the dire, the sudden
the menace with no thought of the
gradual, the lingering itch of whatever.
That was my sister.
A stomach ache had to be diagnosed.
“Oh, come on, it’s no big deal.”
“How do you know? You aren’t me.”
 
At the doctor’s office she waited.
He reached for his stethoscope,
held it to her back and put it away
in his pocket. Then, leaning across
his desk, he asked importantly,
“How long have you been eating your hair?”
She couldn’t answer.
 
After surgery they came into the recovery
room where she had just wakened.
“You are a lucky lady. We found nothing.”
She had an incision and several visitors.
Besides, she was so lucky (incisions heal)
and not a little disgusted.
 
“Me, eating my hair.”"
1159,Never Mind,Dorothea Tanning,"Never mind the pins
And needles I am on.
Let all the other instruments
Of torture have their way.
While air-conditioners
Freeze my coffee
I watch the toaster
Eating my toast.
Did I press the right
Buttons on all these
Buttonless surfaces
Daring me to press them?
Did you gasp on seeing what
The mailman just brought?
 
Will the fellow I saw pedaling
Across the bridge live long
After losing his left leg,
His penis, and his bike
To fearlessness?
Will his sad wife find
Consolation with the
Computer wizard called in
Last year to deal with glitches?
 
Did you defuse the boys’
Bomb before your house
Was under water, same
As everything else?
Aunt Til grabbed her
Silver hand mirror
Before floating away.
The dog yelped constantly,
Tipping our canoe.
Silly dog."
1160,The Percherons,Chard DeNiord,"My sister and I went out to them with sugar
cubes and bridled their heads when they bent down
to eat from our palms. We led them over
to the long white fence on which we climbed
to the topmost rail, then threw our legs
across their backs, clutching the reins to steady
ourselves against their girth, steering them out
into the hills until we were lost, or thought
we were, only to find ourselves at Judith
Creek or Holcomb Rock where we’d turn back
in the early dark, gripping their manes, crouching
low, galloping hard on the high soft
road across the fields to the open barn."
1161,This Ecstasy,Chard DeNiord,"It’s not paradise I’m looking for
but the naming I hardly gave a thought to.
Call it the gift I carried in my loneliness
among the animals before I started
listening to the news. Call it the hint
I had about the knowledge that would explode.
In the meantime, which is real time
plus the past, you’re swishing your skirt
and speaking French, which is more
than I can take, which I marvel at
like a boy from the most distant seat
in the Kronos Dome, where I am one
of so many now I see the point
of falling off. There’s not enough seats
for us all to attend the eschaton.
This ecstasy that plants beauty
on my tongue, so that if it were
a wing, I’d be flying with the quickness
of a hummingbird and grace of a heron,
is so much mercy in light of the darkness
that comes. Who would say consolation?
Who would say dross? Not that anyone
would blame them. All night I hear
so many echoes in the forest I’m tempted
to look back, to save myself in hindsight,
where all I see is the absence of me.
Where all I hear is your voice,
which couldn’t be more strange.
How to go on walking hand in hand
without our bodies on the path
we made for our feet, talking, talking?"
1162,Sunday Calls,Chard DeNiord,"The nurse calls to tell me on Sunday evenings
how he’s doing.
                               How he’s holding his own in front
of the window with a thousand channels behind
the one that saves his screen with snow, fish houses,
and eagles.
                        How the days hang above the ice as vast
recycled pages on which he writes in invisible ink.
How the sun arcs across the sky, then breaks like a plate
above the horizon.
                                    How the temperature drops
below zero at dusk, then continues to fall till morning.
In this way she teaches me how to speak to him in his sleep
at his home in Minnesota, which is the same, she says,
as talking to a friend you’ve never met, but grown close to
nonetheless from hearing his voice.
                                                                   I hear the snow
falling as she holds the phone outside the window.
Silence is the sound of snow falling on snow, I think
as I listen to the flakes inside the air before she closes
the window.
                        “I’m thinking of walleye in their sleep,”
I tell my father.
                              “Of catching them as they dream,
then throwing them back in the hole I drilled by hand
with the auger you gave me as a child, whose handle is stained
with blood from my turning it so many times into the ice
of Bad Medicine.”
                                    I wait for her voice to return, then say,
“Just this for now since any more would disappear the lake
inside his head on which he builds a house for us to fish
throughout the winter.”"
1163,Trailer,Chard DeNiord,"The guests are floating in the lobby,
walking but also gliding to the front desk
then away, checking in, checking out,
muscular souls adorned in cotton,
wool, and rayon, chewing the future
inside their heads, slicing the air
with ironed pleats, avoiding the camera
at every turn so as, so as to get it right
this time, which is the first time.
“First cut, best cut!” the director shouts
since this is also a silent film for the deaf
and therefore everyone. His aim
is to get the cast to see what they’ve
been missing, to disregard the very sounds
that they don’t hear to begin with,
but would notice immediately
if they were gone. See how they glide
on the ether above the floor.
The insouciance, Lord. The insouciance!
They are all here in the magic of the set,
every soul in the guise of a guest
going about her business, a rendezvous here,
as assignation there, the solitary sipping
at the bar. Someone striking appears
at the door. The rain outside beats down
on the streets with terrible force until all
you can hear is the roar of the sky as it passes
above, and then below, on its narrow tracks."
1164,The Triumph of Death,Rosanna Warren,"To Mary Sidney

In your lace ruff you resemble a giant
              snowflake or a spider web
pearled with dew. What poets you catch
 
in your symmetries, at your long table at Wilton
              what wits (Spenser, Fulke-
Greville, Drayton) pitch into the roasted
 
piglet, stewed apples, carp.
              If you rowzed God up, He
knocked you back on your heels, Lady—
 
“O God, why hast thou thus
              Repulst, and scattred us?”—Through the high
windows at Wilton seethe
 
rumors of battle, Philip’s pussing thigh,
              death in the Lowlands. Mother Wrong,
Daughter Strife stalk the cities; still
 
you keep house with grammar, you salt the psalms
              for long preserving. “As smoke in wind,
as wax at fire doth waste”
 
the unjust dissolve. Your stanzas
              stay, still sting the tongue.
Dawn finds you kneeling on stone, calling
 
again the bleak God you believe
              will answer you.
You mix medicines, you write
 
in invisible ink. But Time
              trumps Fame which undoes Death
which masters Chastity and Love—which leaves
 
Eternity, your Master wrote, master of all.
              And like your lace, your lines
shine, not pale, “but whitely,
 
and more whitely pure
              than snow on windless hill that flaking falls,
as one whom labour did to rest allure.”
 
Translate us too, rough line by line,
              into your crystalline
severe design."
1165,The Fête,Charlotte Mew,"To-night again the moon’s white mat
       Stretches across the dormitory floor
While outside, like an evil cat
       The pion prowls down the dark corridor,
       Planning, I know, to pounce on me, in spite
For getting leave to sleep in town last night.
But it was none of us who made that noise,
       Only the old brown owl that hoots and flies
Out of the ivy—he will say it was us boys—
       Seigneur mon Dieu: the sacré soul of spies!
       He would like to catch each dream that lies
           Hidden behind our sleepy eyes:
Their dream? But mine—it is the moon and the wood that sees;
All my long life how I shall hate the trees!
 
In the Place d’Armes the dusty planes, all Summer through,
Dozed with the market women in the sun and scarcely stirred
       To see the quiet things that crossed the Square—,
A tiny funeral, the flying shadow of a bird,
       The hump-backed barber Célestin Lemaire,
       Old Madame Michel in her three-wheeled chair,
              And filing past to Vespers, two and two,
              The demoiselles of the pensionnat
Towed like a ship through the harbour bar,
       Safe into port, where le petit Jésus 
Perhaps makes nothing of the look they shot at you:
       Si, c’est défendu, mais que voulez-vous? 
It was the sun. The sunshine weaves
A pattern on dull stones: the sunshine leaves
       The portraiture of dreams upon the eyes
              Before it dies:
       All Summer through
The dust hung white upon the drowsy planes
Till suddenly they woke with the Autumn rains.
 
       It is not only the little boys
      Who have hardly got away from toys,
But I, who am seventeen next year,
Some nights, in bed, have grown cold to hear
      That lonely passion of the rain
Which makes you think of being dead,
And of somewhere living to lay your head
       As if you were a child again,
Crying for one thing, known and near
Your empty heart, to still the hunger and the fear
    That pelts and beats with it against the pane.
 
              But I remember smiling too
At all the sun’s soft tricks and those Autumn dreads
    In winter time, when the grey light broke slowly through
The frosted window-lace to drag us shivering from our beds.
     And when at dusk the singing wind swung down
Straight from the stars to the dark country roads
                     Beyond the twinkling town,
    Striking the leafless poplar boughs as he went by,
Like some poor, stray dog by the wayside lying dead,
We left behind us the old world of dread,
I and the wind as we strode whistling on under the Winter sky.
 
And then in Spring for three days came the Fair
    Just as the planes were starting into bud
Above the caravans: you saw the dancing bear
    Pass on his chain; and heard the jingle and the thud.
            Only four days ago
            They let you out of this dull show
To slither down the montagne russe and chaff the man à la tête de veau 
            Hit, slick, the bull's eye at the tir,
Spin round and round till your head went queer
On the porcs-roulants. Oh! là là! fête!
 Va pour du vin, et le tête-a-tête 
With the girl who sugars the gaufres! Pauvrette,
    How thin she was! but she smiled, you bet,
 
    As she took your tip—“One does not forget
The good days, Monsieur”. Said with a grace,
But sacrebleu: what a ghost of a face!
    And no fun too for the demoiselles
Of the pensionnat, who were hurried past,
    With their “Oh, que c’est beau—Ah, qu’elle est belle!”
A lap-dog’s life from first to last! ;
The good nights are not made for sleep, nor the good days for dreaming in,
    And at the end in the big Circus tent we sat and shook and stewed like sin!
 
    Some children there had got—but where?
Sent from the south, perhaps—a red bouquet
    Of roses, sweetening the fetid air
With scent from gardens by some far away blue bay.
    They threw one at the dancing bear;
The white clown caught it. From St. Rémy’s tower
    The deep, slow bell tolled out the hour;
The black clown, with his dirty grin
    Lay, sprawling in the dust, as She rode in.
 
She stood on a white horse—and suddenly you saw the bend
    Of a far-off road at dawn, with knights riding by,
A field of spears—and then the gallant day
Go out in storm, with ragged clouds low down, sullen and grey
    Against red heavens: wild and awful, such a sky
    As witnesses against you at the end
Of a great battle; bugles blowing, blood and dust—
The old Morte d’Arthur, fight you must—.
    It died in anger. But it was not death
    That had you by the throat, stopping your breath.
She looked like Victory. She rode my way.
 
She laughed at the black clown and then she flew
             A bird above us, on the wing
Of her white arms; and you saw through
A rent in the old tent, a patch of sky
With one dim star. She flew, but not so high—
             And then she did not fly;
She stood in the bright moonlight at the door
Of a strange room, she threw her slippers on the floor—
                    Again, again
              You heard the patter of the rain,
              The starving rain—it was this Thing,
Summer was this, the gold mist in your eyes;—
                     Oh God! it dies,
                     But after death—,
    To-night the splendour and the sting
    Blows back and catches at your breath,
The smell of beasts, the smell of dust, the scent of all the roses in the world,
                 the sea, the Spring,
The beat of drums, the pad of hoofs, music, the dream, the dream, the
                 Enchanted Thing!
 
    At first you scarcely saw her face,
    You knew the maddening feet were there,
What called was that half-hidden, white unrest
To which now and then she pressed
    Her finger-tips; but as she slackened pace
And turned and looked at you it grew quite bare:
             There was not anything you did not dare:—
Like trumpeters the hours passed until the last day of the Fair.
 
    In the Place d’Armes all afternoon
    The building birds had sung “Soon, soon”,
The shuttered streets slept sound that night,
                      It was full moon:
The path into the wood was almost white,
The trees were very still and seemed to stare:
    Not far before your soul the Dream flits on,
    But when you touch it, it is gone
And quite alone your soul stands there.
 
Mother of Christ, no one has seen your eyes: how can men pray
                    Even unto you?
There were only wolves’ eyes in the wood—
                    My Mother is a woman too:
Nothing is true that is not good,
With that quick smile of hers, I have heard her say;—
I wish I had gone back home to-day;
    I should have watched the light that so gently dies
    From our high window, in the Paris skies,
                    The long, straight chain
    Of lamps hung out along the Seine:
I would have turned to her and let the rain
Beat on her breast as it does against the pane;—
    Nothing will be the same again;—
There is something strange in my little Mother’s eyes,
There is something new in the old heavenly air of Spring—
The smell of beasts, the smell of dust—The Enchanted Thing!
 
All my life long I shall see moonlight on the fern
    And the black trunks of trees. Only the hair
Of any woman can belong to God.
The stalks are cruelly broken where we trod,
                     There had been violets there,
                     I shall not care
As I used to do when I see the bracken burn."
1166,Fin de Fête,Charlotte Mew,"Sweetheart, for such a day
     One mustn’t grudge the score;
Here, then, it’s all to pay,
     It’s Good-night at the door.
 
Good-night and good dreams to you,—
     Do you remember the picture-book thieves
Who left two children sleeping in a wood the long night through,
     And how the birds came down and covered them with leaves?
 
So you and I should have slept,—But now,
     Oh, what a lonely head!
With just the shadow of a waving bough
     In the moonlight over your bed."
1167,From a Window,Charlotte Mew,"Up here, with June, the sycamore throws
                      Across the window a whispering screen;
        I shall miss the sycamore more, I suppose,
Than anything else on this earth that is out in green.
             But I mean to go through the door without fear,
             Not caring much what happens here
                           When I’m away:—
How green the screen is across the panes
              Or who goes laughing along the lanes
        With my old lover all summer day."
1168,Ken,Charlotte Mew,"The town is old and very steep
    A place of bells and cloisters and grey towers,
And black-clad people walking in their sleep—
     A nun, a priest, a woman taking flowers
     To her new grave; and watched from end to end
     By the great Church above, through the still hours:
         But in the morning and the early dark
The children wake to dart from doors and call
Down the wide, crooked street, where, at the bend,
         Before it climbs up to the park,
Ken’s is in the gabled house facing the Castle wall.
 
When first I came upon him there
Suddenly, on the half-lit stair,
I think I hardly found a trace
Of likeness to a human face
     In his. And I said then
If in His image God made men,
Some other must have made poor Ken—
But for his eyes which looked at you
As two red, wounded stars might do.
 
He scarcely spoke, you scarcely heard,
His voice broke off in little jars
To tears sometimes. An uncouth bird
     He seemed as he ploughed up the street,
Groping, with knarred, high-lifted feet
     And arms thrust out as if to beat
          Always against a threat of bars.
 
     And oftener than not there’d be
     A child just higher than his knee
Trotting beside him. Through his dim
     Long twilight this, at least, shone clear,
     That all the children and the deer,
        Whom every day he went to see
Out in the park, belonged to him.
 
         “God help the folk that next him sits
         He fidgets so, with his poor wits,”
The neighbours said on Sunday nights
When he would go to Church to “see the lights!”
     Although for these he used to fix                                                          
     His eyes upon a crucifix
     In a dark corner, staring on
    Till everybody else had gone.
    And sometimes, in his evil fits,
You could not move him from his chair—
You did not look at him as he sat there,
     Biting his rosary to bits.
While pointing to the Christ he tried to say,
    “Take it away”.
 
     Nothing was dead:
He said “a bird” if he picked up a broken wing,
     A perished leaf or any such thing
     Was just “a rose”; and once when I had said
  He must not stand and knock there any more,
  He left a twig on the mat outside my door.
 
     Not long ago
The last thrush stiffened in the snow,
    While black against a sullen sky
       The sighing pines stood by.
But now the wind has left our rattled pane
To flutter the hedge-sparrow’s wing,
The birches in the wood are red again
       And only yesterday
The larks went up a little way to sing
       What lovers say
   Who loiter in the lanes to-day;
   The buds begin to talk of May
   With learned rooks on city trees,
        And if God please
       With all of these
We, too, shall see another Spring.
 
But in that red brick barn upon the hill
    I wonder—can one own the deer,
And does one walk with children still
        As one did here?
        Do roses grow
Beneath those twenty windows in a row—
        And if some night
When you have not seen any light
They cannot move you from your chair
        What happens there?
         I do not know.
 
       So, when they took
Ken to that place, I did not look
After he called and turned on me
His eyes. These I shall see—"
1169,Madeleine in Church,Charlotte Mew,"Here, in the darkness, where this plaster saint
       Stands nearer than God stands to our distress,
And one small candle shines, but not so faint
     As the far lights of everlastingness,
I’d rather kneel than over there, in open day
     Where Christ is hanging, rather pray
         To something more like my own clay,
                     Not too divine;
         For, once, perhaps my little saint
         Before he got his niche and crown,
     Had one short stroll about the town;
     It brings him closer, just that taint—
            And anyone can wash the paint
     Off our poor faces, his and mine!
  
Is that why I see Monty now? equal to any saint, poor boy, as good as gold,
But still, with just the proper trace
Of earthliness on his shining wedding face;
And then gone suddenly blank and old
The hateful day of the divorce:
Stuart got his, hands down, of course
Crowing like twenty cocks and grinning like a horse:
But Monty took it hard. All said and done I liked him best,—
He was the first, he stands out clearer than the rest.
                             It seems too funny all we other rips
       Should have immortal souls; Monty and Redge quite damnably
       Keep theirs afloat while we go down like scuttled ships.—
                            It’s funny too, how easily we sink,
                            One might put up a monument, I think
               To half the world and cut across it “Lost at Sea!”
I should drown Jim, poor little sparrow, if I netted him to-night—
                         No, it’s no use this penny light—
                Or my poor saint with his tin-pot crown—
                The trees of Calvary are where they were,
                       When we are sure that we can spare
                   The tallest, let us go and strike it down
                And leave the other two still standing there.
                                         I, too, would ask Him to remember me
         If there were any Paradise beyond this earth that I could see.                          
                             Oh! quiet Christ who never knew
                     The poisonous fangs that bite us through
                              And make us do the things we do,
                     See how we suffer and fight and die,
                              How helpless and how low we lie,
                     God holds You, and You hang so high,
                     Though no one looking long at You,
                              Can think You do not suffer too,
But, up there, from your still, star-lighted tree
        What can You know, what can You really see
                Of this dark ditch, the soul of me!
 
                We are what we are: when I was half a child I could not sit
Watching black shadows on green lawns and red carnations burning in the sun,
                                                   Without paying so heavily for it
                That joy and pain, like any mother and her unborn child were almost one.
                                                         I could hardly bear
                                 The dreams upon the eyes of white geraniums in the dusk,
                                                 The thick, close voice of musk,
                                        The jessamine music on the thin night air,
                                  Or, sometimes, my own hands about me anywhere —
   The sight of my own face (for it was lovely then) even the scent of my own hair,
            Oh! there was nothing, nothing that did not sweep to the high seat
                     Of laughing gods, and then blow down and beat
   My soul into the highway dust, as hoofs do the dropped roses of the street.
                                            I think my body was my soul,
                                           And when we are made thus
                                                   Who shall control
                           Our hands, our eyes, the wandering passion of our feet,
                                           Who shall teach us
   To thrust the world out of our heart: to say, till perhaps in death,
                                                  When the race is run,
           And it is forced from us with our last breath
                                                  “Thy will be done”?
If it is Your will that we should be content with the tame, bloodless things.
                As pale as angels smirking by, with folded wings—
                        Oh! I know Virtue, and the peace it brings!
                                                   The temperate, well-worn smile
                The one man gives you, when you are evermore his own:
                    And afterwards the child’s, for a little while,
                                                 With its unknowing and all-seeing eyes
          So soon to change, and make you feel how quick
       The clock goes round. If one had learned the trick—
                                                            (How does one though?) quite early on,
                          Of long green pastures under placid skies,
                          One might be walking now with patient truth.
          What did we ever care for it, who have asked for youth,
                          When, oh! my God! this is going or has gone?
 
                              There is a portrait of my mother, at nineteen,
                     With the black spaniel, standing by the garden seat,
                     The dainty head held high against the painted green
And throwing out the youngest smile, shy, but half haughty and half sweet.
                     Her picture then: but simply Youth, or simply Spring
                                  To me to-day: a radiance on the wall,
                                  So exquisite, so heart-breaking a thing
                     Beside the mask that I remember, shrunk and small,
                                     Sapless and lined like a dead leaf,
All that was left of oh! the loveliest face, by time and grief!
 
    And in the glass, last night, I saw a ghost behind my chair—
    Yet why remember it, when one can still go moderately gay—?
                Or could—with any one of the old crew,
                        But oh! these boys! the solemn way
                They take you and the things they say—
                This “I have only as long as you”
    When you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two—
                Although at heart perhaps—God! if it were
                                Only the face, only the hair!
                        If Jim had written to me as he did to-day
                        A year ago—and now it leaves me cold—
                                 I know what this means, old, old, old:
                         Et avec ça—mais on a vécu, tout se paie. 
 
That is not always true: there was my Mother (well at least the dead are free!) 
                Yoked to the man that Father was; yoked to the woman I am, Monty too;
                The little portress at the Convent School, stewing in hell so patiently;
The poor, fair boy who shot himself at Aix. And what of me—and what of me ?
                But I, I paid for what I had, and they for nothing. No, one cannot see
                           How it shall be made up to them in some serene eternity.
If there were fifty heavens God could not give us back the child who went or never came;
                 Here, on our little patch of this great earth, the sun of any darkened day.
              Not one of all the starry buds hung on the hawthorn trees of last year’s May,
                              No shadow from the sloping fields of yesterday;
                 For every hour they slant across the hedge a different way,
                                 The shadows are never the same.
 
                     “Find rest in Him” One knows the parsons’ tags—
                 Back to the fold, across the evening fields, like any flock of baa-ing sheep:
Yes, it may be, when He has shorn, led us to slaughter, torn the bleating soul in us to rags,
                                 For so He giveth His belovèd sleep.
                             Oh! He will take us stripped and done,
                             Driven into His heart. So we are won:
                  Then safe, safe are we? in the shelter of His everlasting wings—
                  I do not envy Him his victories, His arms are full of broken things.
 
                         But I shall not be in them. Let Him take
                                 The finer ones, the easier to break.
And they are not gone, yet, for me, the lights, the colours, the perfumes,
                         Though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms.
                                          In silks and in gemlike wines;
                  Here, even, in this corner where my little candle shines
                                          And overhead the lancet-window glows
                         With golds and crimsons you could almost drink 
To know how jewels taste, just as I used to think
There was the scent in every red and yellow rose
                                Of all the sunsets. But this place is grey,
                                       And much too quiet. No one here,
                                       Why, this is awful, this is fear!
                                                  Nothing to see, no face.
                         Nothing to hear except your heart beating in space
                                        As if the world was ended. Dead at last!
                                        Dead soul, dead body, tied together fast.
                         These to go on with and alone, to the slow end:
                 No one to sit with, really, or to speak to, friend to friend:
                         Out of the long procession, black or white or red
Not one left now to say “Still I am here, then see you, dear, lay here your head”.
                         Only the doll’s house looking on the Park
                 To-night, all nights, I know, when the man puts the lights out, very dark.
With, upstairs, in the blue and gold box of a room, just the maids' footsteps overhead,
Then utter silence and the empty world—the room—the bed—
                                         The corpse! No, not quite dead, while this cries out in me.
                                                          But nearly: very soon to be
                                                          A handful of forgotten dust—
                                        There must be someone. Christ! there must,
                                             Tell me there will be someone. Who?
                                        If there were no one else, could it be You?
 
                                        How old was Mary out of whom you cast
                 So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years
She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past
                 Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon’s house
                                        And stood and looked at You through tears.
                                                     I think she must have known by those
                                        The thing, for what it was that had come to her.
                                        For some of us there is a passion, I suppose,
                                        So far from earthly cares and earthly fears
                                        That in its stillness you can hardly stir
                                                     Or in its nearness, lift your hand,
                                        So great that you have simply got to stand
                                        Looking at it through tears, through tears.
                                        Then straight from these there broke the kiss,
                                                    I think You must have known by this
                                        The thing, for what it was, that had come to You:
                                                    She did not love You like the rest,
                                         It was in her own way, but at the worst, the best,
                                                    She gave You something altogether new.
                                         And through it all, from her, no word,
                                                    She scarcely saw You, scarcely heard:
                                         Surely You knew when she so touched You with her hair,
                                                    Or by the wet cheek lying there,
And while her perfume clung to You from head to feet all through the day
                                         That You can change the things for which we care,
                                         But even You, unless You kill us, not the way.
 
                                         This, then was peace for her, but passion too.        
                                         I wonder was it like a kiss that once I knew,
                                              The only one that I would care to take
       Into the grave with me, to which if there were afterwards, to wake.
                                              Almost as happy as the carven dead
                                         In some dim chancel lying head by head
       We slept with it, but face to face, the whole night through—
One breath, one throbbing quietness, as if the thing behind our lips was endless life,
       Lost, as I woke, to hear in the strange earthly dawn, his “Are you there?”
                                   And lie still, listening to the wind outside, among the firs.
 
       So Mary chose the dream of Him for what was left to her of night and day,
It is the only truth: it is the dream in us that neither life nor death nor any other
                               thing can take away:
       But if she had not touched Him in the doorway of the dream could she have
                               cared so much ?
       She was a sinner, we are what we are: the spirit afterwards, but first the touch.
 
And He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees
Of Eden and Calvary, with its ghosts that have not any eyes for tears,
And the happier guests who would not see, or if they did, remember these,
                                                      Though they lived there a thousand years.
                                       Outside, too gravely looking at me. He seems to stand,
                                                    And looking at Him, if my forgotten spirit came
                                                            Unwillingly back, what could it claim
                                                            Of those calm eyes, that quiet speech,
                                                    Breaking like a slow tide upon the beach,
                                                            The scarred, not quite human hand ?—
                                       Unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings
                                       When it has learned so long not to think, not to be,
              Again, again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things
                                                             That I shall not see!
 
              I cannot bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head:
                     When I was small I never quite believed that He was dead:
                         And at the Convent school I used to lie awake in bed
              Thinking about His hands. It did not matter what they said,
     He was alive to me, so hurt, so hurt! And most of all in Holy Week
                                      When there was no one else to see
                              I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly,
                                               If He had ever seemed to notice me
                                               Or, if, for once, He would only speak."
1170,Not for That City,Charlotte Mew,"Not for that city of the level sun,
     Its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze—
     The shadeless, sleepless city of white days,
White nights, or nights and days that are as one—
We weary, when all is said , all thought, all done.
     We strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see
     What, from the threshold of eternity
We shall step into. No, I think we shun
The splendour of that everlasting glare,
   The clamour of that never-ending song.
   And if for anything we greatly long,
It is for some remote and quiet stair
     Which winds to silence and a space for sleep
     Too sound for waking and for dreams too deep."
1171,The Prairies,William Cullen Bryant,"These are the gardens of the Desert, these
 The unshorn fields, boundless and beautiful,
 For which the speech of England has no name—
 The Prairies. I behold them for the first,
 And my heart swells, while the dilated sight
 Takes in the encircling vastness. Lo! they stretch,
 In airy undulations, far away,
 As if the ocean, in his gentlest swell,
 Stood still, with all his rounded billows fixed,
 And motionless forever. —Motionless?—
 No—they are all unchained again. The clouds
 Sweep over with their shadows, and, beneath,
 The surface rolls and fluctuates to the eye;
 Dark hollows seem to glide along and chase
 The sunny ridges. Breezes of the South!
 Who toss the golden and the flame-like flowers,
 And pass the prairie-hawk that, poised on high,
 Flaps his broad wings, yet moves not—ye have played
 Among the palms of Mexico and vines
 Of Texas, and have crisped the limpid brooks
 That from the fountains of Sonora glide
 Into the calm Pacific—have ye fanned
 A nobler or a lovelier scene than this?
 Man hath no power in all this glorious work:
 The hand that built the firmament hath heaved
 And smoothed these verdant swells, and sown their slopes
 With herbage, planted them with island groves,
 And hedged them round with forests. Fitting floor
 For this magnificent temple of the sky—
 With flowers whose glory and whose multitude
 Rival the constellations! The great heavens
 Seem to stoop down upon the scene in love,— 
 A nearer vault, and of a tenderer blue,
 Than that which bends above our eastern hills.
  
   As o’er the verdant waste I guide my steed,
 Among the high rank grass that sweeps his sides
 The hollow beating of his footsteps seems
 A sacrilegious sound. I think of those
 Upon whose rest he tramples. Are they here—
 The dead of other days?—and did the dust
 Of these fair solitudes once stir with life
 And burn with passion? Let the mighty mounds
 That overlook the rivers, or that rise
 In the dim forest crowded with old oaks,
 Answer. A race, that long has passed away,
 Built them;—a disciplined and populous race
 Heaped, with long toil, the earth, while yet the Greek
 Was hewing the Pentelicus to forms
 Of symmetry, and rearing on its rock
 The glittering Parthenon. These ample fields
 Nourished their harvest, here their herds were fed,
 When haply by their stalls the bison lowed,
 And bowed his maned shoulder to the yoke.
 All day this desert murmured with their toils,
 Till twilight blushed, and lovers walked, and wooed
 In a forgotten language, and old tunes,
 From instruments of unremembered form,
 Gave the soft winds a voice. The red man came—
 The roaming hunter tribes, warlike and fierce,
 And the mound-builders vanished from the earth.
 The solitude of centuries untold
 Has settled where they dwelt. The prairie-wolf
 Hunts in their meadows, and his fresh-dug den
 Yawns by my path. The gopher mines the ground
 Where stood their swarming cities. All is gone;
 All—save the piles of earth that hold their bones,
 The platforms where they worshipped unknown gods,
 The barriers which they builded from the soil
 To keep the foe at bay—till o’er the walls
 The wild beleaguerers broke, and, one by one,
 The strongholds of the plain were forced, and heaped
 With corpses. The brown vultures of the wood
 Flocked to those vast uncovered sepulchres,
 And sat unscared and silent at their feast.
 Haply some solitary fugitive,
 Lurking in marsh and forest, till the sense
 Of desolation and of fear became
 Bitterer than death, yielded himself to die.
 Man’s better nature triumphed then. Kind words
 Welcomed and soothed him; the rude conquerors
 Seated the captive with their chiefs; he chose
 A bride among their maidens, and at length
 Seemed to forget—yet ne’er forgot—the wife
 Of his first love, and her sweet little ones,
 Butchered, amid their shrieks, with all his race.
  
   Thus change the forms of being. Thus arise
 Races of living things, glorious in strength,
 And perish, as the quickening breath of God
 Fills them, or is withdrawn. The red man, too,
 Has left the blooming wilds he ranged so long,
 And, nearer to the Rocky Mountains, sought
 A wilder hunting-ground. The beaver builds
 No longer by these streams, but far away,
 On waters whose blue surface ne’er gave back
 The white man’s face—among Missouri’s springs,
 And pools whose issues swell the Oregon—
 He rears his little Venice. In these plains
 The bison feeds no more. Twice twenty leagues
 Beyond remotest smoke of hunter’s camp,
 Roams the majestic brute, in herds that shake
 The earth with thundering steps—yet here I meet
 His ancient footprints stamped beside the pool.
  
   Still this great solitude is quick with life.
 Myriads of insects, gaudy as the flowers
 They flutter over, gentle quadrupeds,
 And birds, that scarce have learned the fear of man,
 Are here, and sliding reptiles of the ground,
 Startlingly beautiful. The graceful deer
 Bounds to the wood at my approach. The bee,
 A more adventurous colonist than man,
 With whom he came across the eastern deep,
 Fills the savannas with his murmurings,
 And hides his sweets, as in the golden age,
 Within the hollow oak. I listen long
 To his domestic hum, and think I hear
 The sound of that advancing multitude
 Which soon shall fill these deserts. From the ground
 Comes up the laugh of children, the soft voice
 Of maidens, and the sweet and solemn hymn
 Of Sabbath worshippers. The low of herds
 Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain
 Over the dark brown furrows. All at once
 A fresher winds sweeps by, and breaks my dream,
 And I am in the wilderness alone."
1172,To the Fringed Gentian,William Cullen Bryant,"Thou blossom bright with autumn dew,
 And colored with the heaven’s own blue,
 That openest when the quiet light
 Succeeds the keen and frosty night.
  
 Thou comest not when violets lean
 O’er wandering brooks and springs unseen,
 Or columbines, in purple dressed,
 Nod o’er the ground-bird’s hidden nest.
  
 Thou waitest late and com’st alone,
 When woods are bare and birds are flown,
 And frosts and shortening days portend
 The aged year is near his end.
  
 Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
 Look through its fringes to the sky,
 Blue-blue-as if that sky let fall
 A flower from its cerulean wall.
  
 I would that thus, when I shall see
 The hour of death draw near to me,
 Hope, blossoming within my heart,
 May look to heaven as I depart."
1173,The Yellow Violet,William Cullen Bryant,"When beechen buds begin to swell,
   And woods the blue-bird’s warble know,
 The yellow violet’s modest bell
   Peeps from the last year’s leaves below.
  
 Ere russet fields their green resume,
   Sweet flower, I love, in forest bare,
 To meet thee, when thy faint perfume
   Alone is in the virgin air.
  
 Of all her train, the hands of Spring
   First plant thee in the watery mould,
 And I have seen thee blossoming
   Beside the snow-bank’s edges cold.
  
 Thy parent sun, who bade thee view
   Pale skies, and chilling moisture sip,
 Has bathed thee in his own bright hue,
   And streaked with jet thy glowing lip.
  
 Yet slight thy form, and low thy seat,
   And earthward bent thy gentle eye,
 Unapt the passing view to meet
   When loftier flowers are flaunting nigh.
  
 Oft, in the sunless April day,
   Thy early smile has stayed my walk;
 But midst the gorgeous blooms of May,
   I passed thee on thy humble stalk.
  
 So they, who climb to wealth, forget
   The friends in darker fortunes tried.
 I copied them—but I regret
   That I should ape the ways of pride.
  
 And when again the genial hour
   Awakes the painted tribes of light,
 I’ll not o’erlook the modest flower
   That made the woods of April bright."
1174,The Beginning of Speech,Adonis,"The child I was came to me
once,
a strange face
                He said nothing              We walked
each of us glancing at the other in silence, our steps
a strange river running in between
 
We were brought together by good manners
and these sheets now flying in the wind
then we split,
a forest written by earth
watered by the seasons’ change.
 
Child who once was, come forth—
What brings us together now,
and what do we have to say?"
1175,Celebrating Childhood,Adonis,"Even the wind wants
to become a cart
pulled by butterflies.
 
I remember madness
leaning for the first time
on the mind’s pillow.
I was talking to my body then
and my body was an idea
I wrote in red.
 
Red is the sun’s most beautiful throne
and all the other colors
worship on red rugs.
 
Night is another candle.
In every branch, an arm,
a message carried in space
echoed by the body of the wind.
 
The sun insists on dressing itself in fog
when it meets me:
Am I being scolded by the light?
 
Oh, my past days—
they used to walk in their sleep
and I used to lean on them.
 
Love and dreams are two parentheses.
Between them I place my body
and discover the world.
 
Many times
I saw the air fly with two grass feet
and the road dance with feet made of air.
 
My wishes are flowers
staining my days.
 
I was wounded early,
and early I learned
that wounds made me.
 
I still follow the child
who still walks inside me.
 
Now he stands at a staircase made of light
searching for a corner to rest in
and to read the face of night again.
 
If the moon were a house,
my feet would refuse to touch its doorstep.
 
They are taken by dust
carrying me to the air of seasons.
 
I walk,
one hand in the air,
the other caressing tresses
that I imagine.
 
A star is also
a pebble in the field of space.
 
He alone
who is joined to the horizon
can build new roads.
 
A moon, an old man,
his seat is night
and light is his walking stick.
 
What shall I say to the body I abandoned
in the rubble of the house
in which I was born?
No one can narrate my childhood
except those stars that flicker above it
and that leave footprints
on the evening’s path.
 
My childhood is still
being born in the palms of a light
whose name I do not know
and who names me.
 
Out of that river he made a mirror
and asked it about his sorrow.
He made rain out of his grief
and imitated the clouds.
 
Your childhood is a village.
You will never cross its boundaries
no matter how far you go.
 
His days are lakes,
his memories floating bodies.
 
You who are descending
from the mountains of the past,
how can you climb them again,
and why?
 
Time is a door
I cannot open.
My magic is worn,
my chants asleep.
 
I was born in a village,
small and secretive like a womb.
I never left it.
I love the ocean not the shores."
1176,Desert,Adonis,"The cities dissolve, and the earth is a cart loaded with dust
Only poetry knows how to pair itself to this space.
 
No road to this house, a siege,
and his house is graveyard.
               From a distance, above his house
               a perplexed moon dangles
               from threads of dust.
 
I said: this is the way home, he said: No
               you can’t pass, and aimed his bullet at me.
Very well then, friends and their homes
                in all of Beirut’s are my companions.
 
Road for blood now—
               Blood about which a boy talked
               whispered to his friends:
                              nothing remains in the sky now
                              except holes called “stars.”
 
The city’s voice was too tender, even the winds
would not tune its strings—
The city’s face beamed
like a child arranging his dreams for nightfall
bidding the morning to sit beside him on his chair.
 
 
They found people in bags:
              a person                                                 without a head 
              a person                                                 without hands, or tongue
              a person                                                 choked to death
              and the rest had no shapes and no names.
                             —Are you mad? Please
                                                             don’t write about these things.
A page in a book
              bombs mirror themselves inside of it
              prophecies and dust-proverbs mirror themselves inside of it 
              cloisters mirror themselves inside of it, a carpet made of the alphabet
                             disentangles thread by thread
falls on the face of the city, slipping out of the needles of memory.
A murderer in the city’s air, swimming through its wound—
its wound is a fall
that trembled to its name—to the hemorrhage of its name
and all that surrounds us—
houses left their walls behind
                                               and I am no longer I.
 
Maybe there will come a time in which you’ll accept     
to live deaf and mute, maybe
they’ll allow you to mumble: death
                                                and life
                                                resurrection
                                                and peace unto you.

                or smile
                or say I was happy once
                or say I was sad once
                you will see:
                                 there is no country there.
 
 
Murder has changed the city’s shape—this stone
                                                                 is a child’s head—
and this smoke is exhaled from human lungs.
Each thing recites its exile . . .                a sea
                                              of blood—and what
do you expect on these mornings except their arteries set to sail
into the darkness, into the tidal wave of slaughter?
 
 
Stay up with her, don’t let up—
she sits death in her embrace
and turns over her days
                                              tattered sheets of paper.
Guard the last pictures
of her topography—
she is tossing and turning in the sand
in an ocean of sparks—
on her bodies
are the spots of human moans.
 
Seed after seed are cast into our earth—
fields feeding on our legends,
guard the secret of these bloods.
                               I am talking about a flavor to the seasons
                               and a flash of lightning in the sky.

1177,Elizabethan,Linda Pastan,"Some gentler passion slide into my mind,
For I am soft and made of melting snow
—Queen Elizabeth I

 
Her sex sent her mother
to the tower,
made her father profligate
with arrogant desires,
 
but she was made of flint
and backbone.
 
Think of a young girl
in a blue velvet bodice,
a white collar and lace,
the very prototype
of virginal.
 
Think of a woman, her court
enlivened by suitors and lovers
in doublets, in brocaded cloaks,
despite suspicions of their motives
staining the sheets,
 
the way cups of spicy,
flowery mead were sipped
despite the possibility
of poison.
 
Even the crown of the sun
must go down each night.
 
Could she have stood at the prow
of a ship in that great Armada she ordered,
instead of at a window, waiting
for urgent results?
 
Could she have guessed that the words
of a man she inspired, carved
into the marble of ages,
had a muscular beauty
more than equal
to her own worldly triumphs?
 
Daughter, Queen, Ruler
of roiling seas, of meandering
rivers and meadows,
of armies of soldiers, their swords
and armor glittering
like planets to her sun.
 
Namesake to an age.
 
And Poet?
When she turned
to the empty parchment
(or once to a windowpane,
a diamond for quill)
everything
must have gone quiet.
 
Even a queen is naked
before the naked page, awaiting
not the generous spoils owed to a victor
but the gifts freely given
of a besotted muse."
1178,The Farmer’s Bride,Charlotte Mew,"Three summers since I chose a maid,
     Too young maybe—but more’s to do
     At harvest-time than bide and woo.
              When us was wed she turned afraid
     Of love and me and all things human;
     Like the shut of a winter’s day
     Her smile went out, and ’twadn’t a woman—
            More like a little frightened fay.
                    One night, in the Fall, she runned away.
 
     “Out ’mong the sheep, her be,” they said,
     ’Should properly have been abed;
     But sure enough she wadn’t there
     Lying awake with her wide brown stare.
So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down
     We chased her, flying like a hare
     Before our lanterns. To Church-Town
              All in a shiver and a scare
     We caught her, fetched her home at last
              And turned the key upon her, fast.
 
     She does the work about the house
     As well as most, but like a mouse:
              Happy enough to chat and play
              With birds and rabbits and such as they,
              So long as men-folk keep away.
     “Not near, not near!” her eyes beseech
     When one of us comes within reach.
              The women say that beasts in stall
              Look round like children at her call.
              I’ve hardly heard her speak at all.
 
     Shy as a leveret, swift as he,
     Straight and slight as a young larch tree,
     Sweet as the first wild violets, she,
     To her wild self. But what to me?
 
     The short days shorten and the oaks are brown,
              The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky,
     One leaf in the still air falls slowly down,
              A magpie’s spotted feathers lie
     On the black earth spread white with rime,
     The berries redden up to Christmas-time.
              What’s Christmas-time without there be
              Some other in the house than we!
 
              She sleeps up in the attic there
              Alone, poor maid. ’Tis but a stair
     Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,
     The soft young down of her, the brown,
The brown of her—her eyes, her hair, her hair!"
1179,“Oh Fairest of the Rural Maids”,William Cullen Bryant,"Oh fairest of the rural maids!
 Thy birth was in the forest shades;
 Green boughs, and glimpses of the sky,
 Were all that met thine infant eye.
  
 Thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child,
 Were even in the sylvan wild;
 And all the beauty of the place
 Is in thy heart and on thy face.
  
 The twilight of the trees and rocks
 Is in the light shade of thy locks;
 Thy step is as the wind, that weaves
 Its playful way among the leaves.
  
 Thine eyes are springs, in whose serene
 And silent waters heaven is seen;
 Their lashes are the herbs that look
 On their young figures in the brook.
  
 The forest depths, by foot unpressed,
 Are not more sinless than thy breast;
 The holy peace, that fills the air
 Of those calm solitudes, is there."
1180,Rooms,Charlotte Mew,"I remember rooms that have had their part
     In the steady slowing down of the heart.
The room in Paris, the room at Geneva,
The little damp room with the seaweed smell,
And that ceaseless maddening sound of the tide—
     Rooms where for good or for ill—things died.
But there is the room where we (two) lie dead,
Though every morning we seem to wake and might just as well seem to sleep again
     As we shall somewhere in the other quieter, dustier bed
     Out there in the sun—in the rain."
1181,Saturday Market,Charlotte Mew,"Bury your heart in some deep green hollow
     Or hide it up in a kind old tree;
Better still, give it the swallow
     When she goes over the sea.
 
In Saturday’s Market there’s eggs a ’plenty
     And dead-alive ducks with their legs tied down,
Grey old gaffers and boys of twenty—
     Girls and the women of the town—
Pitchers and sugar-sticks, ribbons and laces,
     Poises and whips and dicky-birds’ seed,
Silver pieces and smiling faces,
     In Saturday Market they’ve all they need.
 
What were you showing in Saturday Market
     That set it grinning from end to end
Girls and gaffers and boys of twenty—?
     Cover it close with your shawl, my friend—
Hasten you home with the laugh behind you,
     Over the down—, out of sight,
Fasten your door, though no one will find you,
     No one will look on a Market night.
 
See, you, the shawl is wet, take out from under
     The red dead thing—. In the white of the moon
On the flags does it stir again? Well, and no wonder!
     Best make an end of it; bury it soon.
If there is blood on the hearth who’ll know it?
     Or blood on the stairs,
When a murder is over and done why show it?
     In Saturday Market nobody cares.
      
Then lie you straight on your bed for a short, short weeping
     And still, for a long, long rest,
There’s never a one in the town so sure of sleeping
     As you, in the house on the down with a hole in your breast.
 
              Think no more of the swallow,
                     Forget, you, the sea,
     Never again remember the deep green hollow
                     Or the top of the kind old tree!"
1182,Song,Adonis,"from “Elegy for the First Century”

Bells on our eyelashes
and the death throes of words,
and I among fields of speech,
a knight on a horse made of dirt.
My lungs are my poetry, my eyes a book,
and I, under the skin of words,
on the beaming banks of foam,
a poet who sang and died
leaving this singed elegy
before the faces of poets,
for birds at the edge of sky."
1183,A Winter Piece,William Cullen Bryant,"The time has been that these wild solitudes,
 Yet beautiful as wild, were trod by me
 Oftener than now; and when the ills of life
 Had chafed my spirit—when the unsteady pulse
 Beat with strange flutterings—I would wander forth
 And seek the woods. The sunshine on my path
 Was to me a friend. The swelling hills,
 The quiet dells retiring far between,
 With gentle invitation to explore
 Their windings, were a calm society
 That talked with me and soothed me. Then the chant
 Of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress
 Of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget
 The thoughts that broke my peace, and I began
 To gather simples by the fountain’s brink,
 And lose myself in day-dreams. While I stood 
 In Nature’s loneliness, I was with one
 With whom I early grew familiar, one
 Who never had a frown for me, whose voice
 Never rebuked me for the hours I stole
 From cares I loved not, but of which the world
 Deems highest, to converse with her. When shrieked
 The bleak November winds, and smote the woods,
 And the brown fields were herbless, and the shades,
 That met above the merry rivulet,
 Were spoiled, I sought, I loved them still; they seemed
 Like old companions in adversity.
 Still there was beauty in my walks; the brook,
 Bordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay
 As with its fringe of summer flowers. Afar,
 The village with its spires, the path of streams
 And dim receding valleys, hid before
 By interposing trees, lay visible
 Through the bare grove, and my familiar haunts
 Seemed new to me. Nor was I slow to come
 Among them, when the clouds, from their still skirts,
 Had shaken down on earth the feathery snow,
 And all was white. The pure keen air abroad,
 Albeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard
 Love-call of bird nor merry hum of bee,
 Was not the air of death. Bright mosses crept
 Over the spotted trunks, and the close buds,
 That lay along the boughs, instinct with life,
 Patient, and waiting the soft breath of Spring,
 Feared not the piercing spirit of the North.
 The snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough,
 And ’neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent
 Beneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry
 A circle, on the earth, of withered leaves,
 The partridge found a shelter. Through the snow
 The rabbit sprang away. The lighter track
 Of fox, and the raccoon’s broad path, were there,
 Crossing each other. From his hollow tree
 The squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts
 Just fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway
 Of winter blast, to shake them from their hold. 
  
   But Winter has yet brighter scenes—he boasts
 Splendors beyond what gorgeous Summer knows;
 Or Autumn with his many fruits, and woods
 All flushed with many hues. Come when the rains
 Have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice,
 While the slant of sun of February pours
 Into the bowers a flood of light. Approach!
 The incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps,
 And the broad arching portals of the grove
 Welcome thy entering. Look! the massy trunks
 Are cased in pure crystal; each light spray,
 Nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven,
 Is studded with its trembling water-drops,
 That glimmer with an amethystine light.
 But round the parent-stem the long low boughs
 Bend, in a glittering ring, and arbors hide
 The glassy floor. Oh! you might deem the spot
 The spacious cavern of some virgin mine,
 Deep in the womb of earth—where the gems grow,
 And diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud
 With amethyst and topaz—and the place
 Lit up, most royally, with the pure beam
 That dwells in them. Or haply the vast hall
 Of fairy palace, that outlasts the night,
 And fades not in the glory of the sun;—
 Where crystal columns send forth slender shafts
 And crossing arches; and fantastic aisles
 Wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost
 Among the crowded pillars. Raise thine eye;
 Thou seest no cavern roof; no palace vault;
 There the blue sky and the white drifting cloud
 Look in. Again the wildered fancy dreams
 Of spouting fountains, frozen as they rose,
 And fixed, with all their branching jets, in air,
 And all their sluices sealed. All, all is light;
 Light without shade. But all shall pass away
 With the next sun. From numberless vast trunks
 Loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound
 Like the far roar of rivers, and the eve
 Shall close o’er the brown woods as it was wont.
  
   And it is pleasant, when the noisy streams
 Are just set free, and milder suns melt off
 The plashy snow, save only the firm drift
 In the deep glen or the close shade of pines—
 ’Tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke
 Roll up among the maples of the hill,
 Where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes
 The shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph,
 That from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops,
 Falls, mid the golden brightness of the morn,
 Is gathered in with brimming pails, and oft,
 Wielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe
 Makes the woods ring. Along the quiet air,
 Come and float calmly off the soft light clouds,
 Such as you see in summer, and the winds
 Scarce stir the branches. Lodged in sunny cleft,
   Where the cold breezes come not, blooms alone
 The little wind-flower, whose just opened eye
 Is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at—
 Startling the loiterer in the naked groves
 With unexpected beauty, for the time
 Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.
 And ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft
 Muster their wrath again, and rapid clouds
 Shade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth
 Shall fall their volleyed stores, rounded like hail
 And white like snow, and the loud North again
 Shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage."
1184,The Wound,Adonis,"1.
The leaves asleep under the wind
are the wounds’ ship,
and the ages collapsed on top of each other
are the wound’s glory,
and the trees rising out of our eyelashes
are the wound’s lake.
The wound is to be found on bridges
where the grave lengthens
and patience goes on to no end
between the shores of our love and death.
The wound is a sign,
and the wound is a crossing too.
 
 
2.
To the language choked by tolling bells
I offer the voice of the wound.
To the stone coming from afar
to the dried-up world crumbling to dust
to the time ferried on creaky sleighs
I light up the fire of the wound.
And when history burns inside my clothes
and when blue nails grow inside my books,
I cry out to the day,
“Who are you, who tosses you
into my virgin land?”
And inside my book and on my virgin land
I stare into a pair of eyes made of dust.
I hear someone saying,
“I am the wound that is born
and grows as your history grows.”
 
 
3.
I named you cloud,
wound of the parting dove.
I named you book and quill
and here I begin the dialogue
between me and the ancient tongue
in the island of tomes
in the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I teach these words
to the wind and the palms,
O wound of the parting dove.
 
 
4.
If I had a harbor in the land
of dreams and mirrors, if I had a ship,
if I had the remains
of a city, if I had a city
in the land of children and weeping,
I would have written all this down for the wound’s sake,
a song like a spear
that penetrates trees, stone, and sky,
soft like water
unbridled, startling like conquest.
 
 
5.
Rain down on our desert
O world adorned with dream and longing.
Pour down, and shake us, we, the palms of the wound,
tear out branches from trees that love the silence of the wound,
that lie awake staring at its pointed eyelashes and soft hands.
 
World adorned with dream and longing
world that falls on my brow
like the lash of a wound,
don’t come close—the wound is closer—
don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful.
That magic that your eyes had flung
on the last kingdoms—
the wound has passed over it,
passed and did not leave a single sail
to tempt toward salvation, did not leave
a single island behind."
1185,Becoming Anne Bradstreet,Eavan Boland,"It happens again
As soon as I take down her book and open it.
 
I turn the page.
My skies rise higher and hang younger stars.
 
The ship's rail freezes.
 Mare Hibernicum leads to Anne Bradstreet's coast.
  
A blackbird leaves her pine trees
And lands in my spruce trees.
  
I open my door on a Dublin street.
Her child/her words are staring up at me:
  
 In better dress to trim thee was my mind,
 But nought save home-spun cloth, i' th' house I find.
  
We say home truths
Because her words can be at home anywhere—
 
At the source, at the end and whenever
The book lies open and I am again
 
An Irish poet watching an English woman
Become an American poet."
1186,Leaving the Hospital,Anya Silver,"As the doors glide shut behind me,
the world flares back into being—
I exist again, recover myself,
sunlight undimmed by dark panes,
the heat on my arms the earth’s breath.
The wind tongues me to my feet
like a doe licking clean her newborn fawn.
At my back, days measured by vital signs,
my mouth opened and arm extended,
the nighttime cries of a man withered
child-size by cancer, and the bells
of emptied IVs tolling through hallways.
Before me, life—mysterious, ordinary—
holding off pain with its muscular wings.
As I step to the curb, an orange moth
dives into the basket of roses
that lately stood on my sickroom table,
and the petals yield to its persistent
nudge, opening manifold and golden."
1187,Lines Composed on the Body Politic: An Accounting,Rita Dove,"Elizabeth, The Lodge at Woodstock, 1554

 
Less than the charting of each dawn’s resolutions,
less than each evening’s trickle of doubt,
less than a crown’s weight in silver, a diamond’s                  
scratch against glass, less than the touted
 
ill luck of my rich beginnings—and yet
more than Eve’s silence, my mute ingratitude.
More than music’s safe passage, its rapturous net,
more than this stockpile of words, their liquid solicitude; 
         
more desired than praise (the least-prized of my dreams),
less real than dreaming (castle keep for my sins),
more than no more, which seems
much less than hoped-for, again—
 
one mutiny, quelled; one wish lost, a forgotten treasure:
to live without scrutiny, beyond constant measure."
1188,Moment,Carol L. Gloor,"At the moment of my mother’s death
I am rinsing frozen chicken.
No vision, no rending
of the temple curtain, only
the soft give of meat.
I had not seen her in four days.
I thought her better,
and the hospital did not call,
so I am fresh from
an office Christmas party,
scotch on my breath
as I answer the phone.
And in one moment all my past acts
become irrevocable."
1189,Hypostasis & New Year,Peter Gizzi,"For why am I afraid to sing
the fundamental shape of awe
should I now begin to sing the silvered back of
       the winter willow spear
the sparkling agate blue
would this blade and this sky free me to speak
      intransitive lack –
 
the vowels themselves free
 
Of what am I afraid
of what lies in back of me of day
these stars scattered as far as the I
what world and wherefore
will it shake free
why now in the mind of an afternoon is a daisy
      for a while
flagrant and alive
 
Then what of night
of hours’ unpredicated bad luck and the rot
       it clings to
fathomless on the far side in winter dark
 
Hey shadow world when a thing comes back
comes back unseen but felt and no longer itself
       what then
what silver world mirrors tarnished lenses
what fortune what fate
and the forms not themselves but only itself the sky
by water and wind shaken
I am born in silvered dark
 
Of what am I to see these things between myself
       and nothing
between the curtain and the stain
between the hypostatic scenes of breathing
and becoming the thing I see
are they not the same
 
Things don’t look good on the street today
beside a tower in a rusting lot
one is a condition the other mystery
even this afternoon light so kind and nourishing
a towering absence vibrating air
 
Shake and I see pots from old shake
       and I see cities anew
I see robes shake I see desert
I see the farthing in us all the ghost of day
the day inside night as tones decay
       and border air
it is the old songs and the present wind I sing
and say I love the unknown sound in a word
 
Mother where from did you leave me on the sleeve
       of a dying word
of impish laughter in the midst my joy
I compel and confess open form
my cracked hinged picture doubled
 
I can’t remember now if I made a pact with the devil
       when I was young
when I was high
on a sidewalk I hear “buy a sweatshirt?” and think
buy a shirt from the sweat of children
       hell
I’m just taking a walk in the sun in a poem
      and this sound
caught in the most recent coup"
1190,True Discourse on Power,Peter Gizzi,"When I say the ghost has begun
you understand what is being said.
That time is not how we keep it
       or measure
first there was then wasn’t . . .
It twitters and swerves like
       the evening news.
Now outside is 3D. Inside non-
       representational space.
Every law has an outside
      and inside
I have witnessed cruelty
break and gulp and sweat then
       punch out a smile.
To be awake. This talking in space.
To be absorbed in the ongoing.
Belief’s a shadow to be looked into
       and into
until relief is gone. The dark
triangle settled in the midst of
       traffic is on us.
Time comes in adverbial bursts,
a glass of beer, a smoke . . .
The evening air refreshes, startles,
and the questions grow deeper like
        shadows across storefronts.
A forsythia ticking against
       the dirty pane.
This was time. Up. Down. Up.
And you were a part of it.
If I say it can you feel it now?
Imagine. Lightning strikes. Rain
       falls and drives.
Clouds pass. Night clarified. Stars.
In silent pictures the tree falls
       in the optic nerve.
The sound is chemistry.
There’s no getting to it or if
       getting to it
feels like the actual sound
       is that silence?
Alone here with my shadows
       drawn . . .
So what’s this about?
A horse and a castle, a tree
       and its leaving?
What’s this about in solitary
       splendor?
The undertow and its threshold,
a door and the opening sky?
Or because a play of reflection
       lit up my bumper
and caught my eyes
I saw the shadow of a falcon.
Because a sound a poor man
       uttered
reached my ear I fell into song.
If the syntax of loyalty is not tragic
       then what is the wager?
If there were time, would it be ours?"
1191,Getting and Spending,Linda Gregerson,"Isabella Whitney, The maner of her Wyll, 1573

We’re told it was mostly the soul
              at stake, its formal
 
              setting-forth, as over water,
where, against all odds,
 
the words-on-paper make
              a sort of currency, which heaven,
 
              against all odds, accepts.
So Will, which is to say, May what
 
I purpose, please, this once, and what
              will happen coincide.
 
              To which the worldly
dispositions were mere after-thought:
 
your mother’s ring and so forth. What
              the law considered yours
 
              to give. Which in the case of
women was restricted—this was
 
long ago, and elsewhere—so
              that one confessedly “weak
 
              of purse” might all the more
emphatically be thought of as having little
 
to say. Except about the soul. The late
              disturbance in religion
 
              having done that much, the each
for each responsible, even a servant,
 
even the poor. Wild, then—quite       
              beyond the pale—to hustle
 
              the soul-part so hastily off
the page. And turn, our Isabella Whitney,
 
to the city and its faithlessness. Whose
              smells and sounds—the hawker’s cry,
 
              the drainage ditch in Smithfield—all
the thick-laid, lovely, in-your-face-and-nostrils stuff
 
of getting-by no woman of even the slightest
              affectation would profess to know,
 
              much less to know so well.
As one would know the special places on
 
his body, were the passion merely personal.

Wattle and brickwork. Marble and mud.
              The city’s vast tautology. No city
 
              without people and no people but
will long for what the city says they lack:
 
high ceilings, gloves and laces, news,
              the hearth-lit circle of friendship, space
             
              for solitude, enough to eat.
And something like a foothold in the whole-of-it,
 
some without-which-not, some
              little but needful part in all the passing-
 
              from-hand-to-hand of it, so
every time the bondsman racks his debtor or
 
the shoemaker hammers a nail or one un-
              practiced girl imagines she
 
              has prompted a look of wistfulness,
a piece of it is yours because
 
your seeing it has made it that much slower
              to rejoin the blank
 
              oblivion of never-having-
been. The year was fifteen hundred seventy-
 
three. The year of our Redeemer, as
              they used to say. That other
 
              circuit of always-in-your-
debt. From which she wrested, in her open
 
I-am-writing-not-for-fun-but-for-the-money
              way of authorship, a world
 
              not just of plenty but—and here’s
the part of that’s legacy—of love."

             burned distant, dull. I was tired, but you
 insisted on one more, so I chalked
             the cue—the bored blue—broke, scratched.
 It was always possible
             for you to run the table, leave me
 nothing. But I recall the easy
             shot you missed, and then the way
 we both studied, circling—keeping
             what you had left me between us."
1193,Not Over It,Heather McHugh,"In sympathy with Gaspara Stampa

By woman so touched, so pressed,
detachment being thought
achievable at all
 
is boggling in itself. Its being
thought achievable by love—but love
for only all (not someone’s single) sentience—
 
appears the precept of too cold
a form of flame. How much
of a hand in things
 
relinquishes the hold
of things-at-hand?
What kiss might such
 
a mind reclaim? A swirl of dust
in Buddhist schools, perhaps.
A view of several solar
 
systems from above.
Not love.
The thought
 
appeals as it appals:
Slow learners, we must spurn
the selving sensualities, to feel
 
for feelers of this kind,
unfasten passion’s burner
to identify what’s under it—
 
in short, must court
dispassion just
to be compassionate."
1194,"To Mary Sidney, On Reading Her Psalms",Jacqueline Osherow,"You give me a little courage, Mary,
in your skittish dedication to her highness;
I too can dare as humbleness may dare;
if there’s anywhere to speak with you, it’s here
at the wordy Anglo-Saxon periphery
of the universe’s one great surge of praise
 
though I’m lost here. Where’s the joyful noise?
the syllables I managed to memorize
before they were weighted down by meaning?
and what’s all this complicated rhyme?
Don’t mistake me—I’m not complaining;
it’s just not my notion of a psalm
 
for all my love of wrought, elaborate things—
especially when they’re the sort that sings
and yours do sing a stunning song—
but they’re off-kilter without the awe
inherent in my ancient holy tongue.
I miss my amen sela, hallelujah
 
though I do applaud you and your brother—
going for the full linguistic bait-and-switch
in the move from one language to another:
David’s disarmingly direct speech
a tour-de-force of formal contrivance
(no form repeated more than once
 
in each of a hundred fifty psalms!)
in your show-off/virtuoso hands.
Talk about such a song in such a land—
but what else is there in dreary England?
Its sole extravagance a trove of synonyms
that endlessly perplexes and expands
 
its mongrel, unbeautiful tongue—
a language, frankly, crying out for poetry
given its absence, even, of integrity
not to mention intrinsic song. . . .
(Its sound: water going down the drain
according to my friend, an Italian,
 
after riding in a compartment of Americans
gurgling all the way from Florence to Rome.)
Why not a convoluted scheme
of intricately wrought meter and rhyme?
So what if the Hebrew has no strict patterns?
Aim for a parallel sublime;
 
aren’t poems for the impossible?
Though perhaps yours wouldn’t have been written
had you known how daunting their task was;
you had no Hebrew, used the Coverdale,
Wyatt, Geneva Bible, as cribs for Latin,
even psaumes de David, mis en rime Françoise . . .
 
Clearly, your secret weapon was ignorance,
also useful (look at me!) in writing a poem,
your psalms fourth- and fifth-hand half the time.
Unless (of course!) your stroke of brilliance
was to focus on the one thing you could do:
 Sing and let your song be new
  
which they are, profoundly, even to me,
who know so many bits of the originals
of what you claim you’re “translating” by heart.
Still, I’ll be reading along, alternately
put off and spellbound by your art-
ifice, when my wary eye suddenly falls
 
on something both completely known and new,
my own—our own—ungainly language
for a brief instant alien with grace,
a black-on-white typescript mirage
in which English letters turn into Hebrew
or at least intercept its holiness. . . .
 
How did you manage it, Mary?
Your contemporaries called it piety—
but I don’t believe that for a second.
What motivated you was love of poetry,
or rather of your legendary
brother—lost so young—whom you would spend
 
your whole life working to immortalize. . . .
I’m not sure he needed you. No lighter touch
exists in English poetry than his . . .
a touch you often managed to approach
in your grief-induced lyric resolve
to force a bit of him to stay alive.
 
Poetry as solace, as wizardry—
and there he is, with you, all the time,
clearly palpable in all your artistry.
It was your eagerness to be with him
that kept you going back to intervene
with yet one more indomitable line,
 
got you through all hundred-fifty psalms.
Or maybe it was just your poet’s ruse
(poetry often thrives on self-delusion)
to trick yourself to rise to his occasion. . . .
Unless he just provided the excuse
to stake your own (quite vast) poetic claims,
 
impossible to say from this vantage point:
to distinguish collaborator from muse,
self-doubt from false humility
but, then again, there’s a poetry in mystery.
Who will contradict me if I confuse
my own passions with yours—so convenient,
 
inevitable?—in a poem like this—
though you and I—despite the labyrinth
of misapprehension, class, religion
reinforcing our dissociation
(Jew from Christian, commoner from countess,
twenty-first-century from seventeenth)
 
come together in passion upon passion
(forgive me, Mary, if dare too far):
psalms, poetic forms, your genius brother
(I mean both the poet and the man;
no poem could manufacture that much charm).
We’ve even suffered from a kindred harm:
 
my version, albeit, fairly mild,
though I too was admonished as a child
about what a woman dared not do.
Still, I have a vast cohort, while you
were almost entirely alone.
Better yet, I had the complete Dickinson
 
(published just a year before I was born);
I didn’t know it yet, but I had you . . .
while you had to ransack antiquity
for even fragments of poems by a woman.
But of course you weren’t troubled by inequity—
it was, frankly, all you knew—
 
you might even have relished your position
as sole woman poet, thinker, patron—
lonely as it was—though you did encourage
your precocious niece, Mary (later Wroth).
And who can really estimate the damage
of your appalling bargain: a brother’s death
 
required to turn you into poet?
Of course, in your time, death was everywhere.
Perhaps you were pious—a last resort
to shore up an attenuated heart
against even further disrepair,
immersion in the psalms a sort of antidote
 
to life’s massive overdose of pain:
from living with a sad, disfigured mother
(small-pox scars from nursing a sick queen)
mourning her husband’s lost affection
to deaths of favorites—your sister, your brother,
your only daughters, Katherine, then Anne.
 
 God made this day; he did us send it
 In joy and mirth then let us spend it
Excellent advice, if it would hold—
And maybe it does, when you can summon
 all that air or life enfold
to distract you with a binge of exaltation . . .
  
or if that fails, then an assiduous
extravaganza of sublime detail
calibrated to provide the wherewithal
to face a universe we cannot alter
if not with joy and mirth, at least with grace:
a perfect, hand-illuminated psalter,
  
the loops of all its letters filled with gold—
a treasure, even, for an exacting Queen—
offering a deity who’ll listen
to a voice alternately humble, bold,
beseeching, thankful, ecstatic, bleak,
through which (hallelujah, Mary!) you still speak."
1195,“The Altar” by George Herbert,Connie Voisine,"Tulips panted against the wall. So much need to feed
 a crisp stem, I thought, as we put our fingers 
in the bullet holes above the bed. Typed captions translated
photos of Rivera, Kahlo, Trotsky and his wife 

in her boxy suit, devoted smile, that hopeful hat
with bent feather below an image of the assassin 
who would get her husband in the end. George Herbert was 
what I translated, The Temple, the only book I brought, 

where he says the heart must be a stone on which 
to build God’s altar—no love without affliction:
my hard heart meets in this frame. In those days, 
I loved the jungle, spread like wool below 

an unsteady sky and the crumbling pyramid’s altar top 
flocked with moonlight. I loved the monkeys 
throwing sticks and rinds at tourists from their nests 
in the trees. The noise at night, the hysterical crush 

of insect limbs rubbing, animal want, all night banged 
against the window, each with an urgent song of me me me. 
How loud the fecund world can be. Mi corazon duro, 
I wrote, bored, and smoke rose from other tables, 

from the wheels of the cars on the cobbled roads, 
and once I saw a mouse, suicidal, enter the frantic 
crowd. I cried out at the park in Mexico City 
where Indians, ropes on their ankles, dove like 

fatal birds to the ground while a Hassid, in his 19th-century 
cloak kept after me, Speak English? English? He said, 
We’ve all become vegetarians. There isn’t a butcher 
for miles. I watched his black hat disappear 

into the swarm of vendors, masked dancers. Was that it, 
devotion? Young and gorgeous for it, I crept away 
one night, met a German hippie and he pulled my swimsuit 
aside in the volcanic lake. The fat Costa Rican’s coffee plantation 

unfolded below, the ranging packs of filthy dogs, the water 
so hot and sulfured I gleamed like something ephemeral. 
Sometimes I saw movies, cheap Hong Kong action films 
dubbed into Spanish with Mandarin subtitles. But that started 

to get difficult, the young men dying with extravagance, 
the improbable ballet of whizzing swords, gun fights 
in teahouses filled with caged birds. Herbert, 
consumptive and small country parish-bound, 

wrote that struggle must be the same as resolution, 
as faith itself, while he suffocated in his sad minister’s bed, 
for years arguing with God and himself. It’s the uglier 
business, willing yourself from despair to belief. 

In those days, I thought the saints, robes heavy with must, 
with ancient, gnarled hands, deserved the nothing 
they felt their way toward. In those days, my favorite saints 
were the ones who burned away young—I admired them 

in the cathedral paintings, hooded eyes, the brutal 
wings of their ribs, gilt halos, baroque frames. What does it mean, 
devotion? Mothers weep in the corners of those paintings
while a man, each morning, sweeps the church floor."
1196,Compline,Philip Metres,"That we await a blessed hope, & that we will be struck
With great fear, like a baby taken into the night, that every boot,

Every improvised explosive, Talon & Hornet, Molotov 
& rubber-coated bullet, every unexploded cluster bomblet, 

Every Kevlar & suicide vest & unpiloted drone raining fire 
On wedding parties will be burned as fuel in the dark season. 

That we will learn the awful hunger of God, the nerve-fraying 
Cry of God, the curdy vomit of God, the soiled swaddle of God, 

The constant wakefulness of God, alongside the sweet scalp 
Of God, the contented murmur of God, the limb-twitched dream-

Reaching of God. We’re dizzy in every departure, limb-lost. 
We cannot sleep in the wake of God, & God will not sleep 

The infant dream for long. We lift the blinds, look out into ink
For light. My God, my God, open the spine binding our sight."
1197,Consciousness,Joanie Mackowski,"How it is fickle, leaving one alone to wander

the halls of the skull with the fluorescents
softly flickering. It rests on the head

like a bird nest, woven of twigs and tinsel
and awkward as soon as one stops to look.
That pile of fallen leaves drifting from

the brain to the fingertip burned on the stove, 

to the grooves in that man’s voice 
as he coos to his dog, blowing into the leaves 

of books with moonlit opossums
and Chevrolets easing down the roads 
of one’s bones. And now it plucks a single 

tulip from the pixelated blizzard: yet 

itself is a swarm, a pulse with no
indigenous form, the brain’s lunar halo. 

Our compacted galaxy, its constellations 
trembling like flies caught in a spider web, 
until we die, and then the flies

buzz away—while another accidental 

coherence counts to three to pass the time 
or notes the berries on the bittersweet vine

strewn in the spruces, red pebbles dropped
in the brain’s gray pool. How it folds itself 
like a map to fit in a pocket, how it unfolds 

a fraying map from the pocket of the day."
1198,Creole,Robert Pinsky,"I’m tired of the gods, I’m pious about the ancestors: afloat
In the wake widening behind me in time, the restive devisers.

My father had one job from high school till he got fired at thirty. 
The year was 1947 and his boss, planning to run for mayor, 

Wanted to hire an Italian veteran, he explained, putting it
In plain English. I was seven years old, my sister was two. 

The barbarian tribes in the woods were so savage the Empire 
Had to conquer them to protect and clear its perimeter.

So into the woods Rome sent out missions of civilizing 
Governors and invaders to establish schools, courts, garrisons:

Soldiers, clerks, officials, citizens with their household slaves.
Years or decades or entire lives were spent out in the hinterlands—

Which might be good places to retire on a government pension,
Especially if in those work-years you had acquired a native wife.

Often I get these things wrong or at best mixed up but I do
Feel piety toward those persistent mixed families in Gaul,

Britain, Thrace. When I die may I take my place in the wedge
Widening and churning in the mortal ocean of years of souls.

As I get it, the Roman colonizing and mixing, the intricate Imperial
Processes of enslaving and freeing, involved not just the inevitable

Fucking in all senses of the word, but also marriages and births
As developers and barbers, scribes and thugs mingled and coupled

With the native people and peoples. Begetting and trading, they
Needed to swap, blend and improvise languages—couples

Especially needed to invent French, Spanish, German: and I confess— 
Roman, barbarian—I find that Creole work more glorious than God.

The way it happened, the school sent around a notice: anybody
Interested in becoming an apprentice optician, raise your hand.

It was the Great Depression, anything about a job sounded good to
Milford Pinsky, who told me he thought it meant a kind of dentistry.

Anyway, he was bored sitting in study hall, so he raised his hand,
And he got the job as was his destiny—full-time, once he graduated.

Joe Schiavone was the veteran who took the job, not a bad guy,
Dr. Vineburg did get elected mayor, Joe worked for him for years.

At the bank an Episcopalian named John Smock, whose family owned
A piece of the bank, had played sports with Milford. He gave him a small

Loan with no collateral, so he opened his own shop, grinding lenses
And selling glasses: as his mother-in-law said, “almost a Professional.”

Optician comes from a Greek word that has to do with seeing. 
Banker comes from an Italian word for a bench, where people sat,

I imagine, and made loans or change. Pinsky like “Tex” or “Brooklyn” 
Is a name nobody would have if they were still in that same place: 

Those names all signify someone who’s been away from home a while. 
Schiavone means “a Slav.” Milford is a variant on the names of poets—

Milton, Herbert, Sidney—certain immigrants gave their offspring. 
Creole comes from a word meaning to breed or to create, in a place."
1199,Dare,Nate Klug,"Not, this time, to infer
but to wait you out
between regret and parking lot
somewhere in the day 
like a dare

Salt grime and the foodcarts’
rising steam, at Prospect St. a goshawk
huge and aloof, picking at something,
nested in twigs and police tape
for a while we all
held our phones up

It is relentless, the suddenness
of every other 
song, creature, neighbor
as though this life 
would prove you
only by turning into itself"
1200,Flowers,Wendy Videlock,"for my mother

They are fleeting.
They are fragile.
They require

little water.
They’ll surprise you.
They’ll remind you

that they aren’t
and they are you."
1201,From “Coleshill”,Fiona Sampson,"The deer racing across a field
of the same clay and tallow
color they are—if they are:
or are they tricks of the light?—
must feel themselves being poured
and pouring through life. We’re not built

but become: trembling columns
of apprehension that ripple
and pass those ripples to and fro
with the world that shakes around us—
it too is something poured
and ceaselessly pouring itself. 

February shakes the fields
and trembles in each yellow willow.

                                •

The violin’s back is not veneer—
the strummed wood shudders together.
Undivided by caution
each note is its own first thought.

My first thought’s a kind of prayer
that I might resonate entire—
sometimes it’s such a meager portion
shaking a little, as if it ought...

Every day, the same desire
to push myself through the door
that leads to some bright place,

brighter than the concert platform,
where the whole self echoes together—
the outer to the inner pleasure.
                                
                                •

Everything runs together—
the light smells of spring,
the unreasonable brightness
of this peg, this sheet, this line tethering

linen between sky and mud 
as if the garden marked a pause
in that eternal return
whose looping trace is the blood

hissing through the ventricles.
What gives you life’s the thing that kills.
Until you spill the lip
trembling on its bright liquid

all you need’s this play of surface—
all that you need. All you have."
1202,God,Langston Hughes,"I am God—
Without one friend,
Alone in my purity
World without end.

Below me young lovers
Tread the sweet ground—
But I am God—
I cannot come down.

Spring!
Life is love!
Love is life only!
Better to be human
Than God—and lonely.

1203,How to Get There,Philip Levine,"Turn left off Henry onto Middagh Street 
     to see our famous firehouse, home
          of Engine 205 and

Hook & Ladder 118 and home also to
     the mythic painting “Fire under
          the Bridge” decorating

the corrugated sliding door. The painting
     depicts a giant American flag
          wrinkled by wind   

and dwarfing the famous Brooklyn Bridge
     as it stretches as best it can 
          to get a purchase

on Manhattan. In the distance a few dismal
     towers and beyond the towers
          still another river.
          
A little deal table holds a tiny American
     flag—like the one Foreman held
          as he bowed to

receive gold at the ’68 Olympics in Mexico
     City—; this actual flag is rooted in
          a can of hothouse

roses going brown at the edges and beginning 
     to shed. There’s a metal collection
          box bearing the 

names of those lost during the recent burnings.
     Should you stop to shake the box—
          which is none

of your business—you’ll hear only a whisper.
     Perhaps the donations are all
          hush money,

ones, fives, tens, twenties, or more likely
     there are IOUs and the heart
          of Brooklyn 

has gone cold from so much asking.
     Down the block and across
          the street, a man

sleeps on the sidewalk, an ordinary
     man, somehow utterly spent,
          he sleeps through 

all the usual sounds of a Brooklyn noon.
     Beside him a dog, a terrier,
          its muzzle resting

on crossed paws, its brown eyes wide
     and intelligent. Between man
          and dog sits

a take-out coffee cup meant to receive,
     next to it a picture of Jesus—
          actually
    
a digital, color photograph of the Lord 
     in his prime, robed and 
          though bearded
    
impossibly young and athletic, and—
     as always—alone. “Give 
          what you can,”  

says a hand-lettered cardboard sign 
     to all who pass. If you stand
          there long enough

without giving or receiving the shabby,
     little terrier will close his eyes.
          If you stand

there long enough the air will thicken 
     with dusk and dust and exhaust
          and finally with

a starless dark. The day will become something
     it’s never been before, something for
          which I have no name."

1205,In Whose Unctions,Greg Glazner,"After Stevens

By now the snow is easing
the live nerves of the wire fence
and the firs,
                              softening the distances it falls through,
laying down a rightness, 
as in the spackled whites,
the woodgrains of a room’s hush

before a lush legato in whose unctions
the excruciations ease,
                                            as in the first
thick arrhythmics from the hardwoods

of wintry music, all sideslip and immense descent,

the listening."
1206,Keats’s Phrase,Albert Goldbarth,"My father’s been dead for thirty years
but when he appears behind my shoulder
offering advice, or condemnation, or a quiet pride
in something I’ve done that isn’t even thistledown
or tiny shavings of balsa wood in the eyes of the world
—“Albie, grip in the middle and turn
with a steady pressure”—it’s measurable,
if not the way the wind is in a sock,
or ohms, or net-and-gross, it registers the way
an absence sometimes does, and I listen to him
with a care I never exhibited when he was a presence,
alive, in his undershirt, chewing his tiny licorice pellets
and radiating a rough-hewn love. “Negative
capability”—the phrase of course is Keats’s,

from his letters, but we make it ours a hundred times
a day. A hundred times we do our own pedestrian
version of early maritime cartography: the known world
stops, and over its edge the fuddled mapmaker writes
Here There Be Monsters and then illustrates 
their non-existing coiled lengths and hell-breath
with a color-splotched vivacity he wouldn’t waste
on inhabited shores. Or: “Don’t think
of a polar bear!”...the game one plays
with a child. But I say with adult certainty that
when Eddie’s wife Fiona went back to stripping
he couldn’t stand to be at the club and see, and yet
those empty hours in his mind were populated just
as unbearably—and indeed, yes, there

were monsters in that void, and the vigilant bears
of insecurity and jealousy padded hungrily behind
his eyes each night until her return. For Keats,
however, the force that emptiness makes kinetic is
a positive one, the way that the invisible, unknowable
“dark energy” is seminal, a kind of funding agency
or sugar daddy powering the universe in all
its spangled beauty and veiled mystery
from behind the scenes. Last night, a woozy few of us
were mourning the demise of The Dusty Bookshelf.
“Well I tried to support it,” I said, “by stopping in from time
to time.” And B, the king of local kleptobibliomania, with
his nimble touch and expando-capacious overalls, said
“I tried to support it by not going in.”"
1207,A Lullaby,Janet Loxley Lewis,"Lullee, lullay,
I could not love thee more
If thou wast Christ the King.
Now tell me, how did Mary know
That in her womb should sleep and grow
The Lord of everything?

Lullee, lullay,
An angel stood with her
Who said: “That which doth stir
Like summer in thy side
Shall save the world from sin.
Then stable, hall, and inn
Shall cherish Christmas-tide.”

Lullee, lullay,
And so it was that Day.
And did she love Him more
Because an angel came
To prophesy His name?
Ah no, not so,
She could not love Him more,
But loved Him just the same.
Lullee, lullay.

1208,Momentary,A.E. Stallings,"I never glimpse her but she goes
Who had been basking in the sun,
Her links of chain mail one by one
Aglint with pewter, bronze and rose.

I never see her lying coiled
Atop the garden step, or under
A dark leaf, unless I blunder
And by some motion she is foiled.

Too late I notice as she passes
Zither of chromatic scale—
I only ever see her tail
Quicksilver into tall grasses.

I know her only by her flowing,
By her glamour disappearing
Into shadow as I’m nearing—
I only recognize her going."

thou
 hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forgot that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest. 

Through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play of the many.

No more noisy, loud words from me, such is my master’s will. Hence-forth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song. 

Men hasten to the King’s market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.

Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time, and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.

Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him, and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!

iii

On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.

Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south wind.

That vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing, and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.

I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.

iv

By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. But it is otherwise with thy love, which is greater than theirs, and thou keepest me free. Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. But day passes by after day and thou are not seen.

If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart—thy love for me still waits for my love.

v

I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of this life. What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight? When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother. Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well. The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left one.

vi

Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well. Oh, thou beautiful, there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colors and sounds and odors. There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth. And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest. 

But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor night, nor form nor color, and never never a word.

something small

There are senses

in their simple
feeling for one.

Originally appeared in the February 1966 issue of Poetry magazine."
1212,A Prayer for Rain,Lisel Mueller,"Let it come down: these thicknesses of air
have long enough walled love away from love;
stillness has hardened until words despair
of their high leaps and kisses shut themselves
back into wishing. Crippled lovers lie
against a weather which holds out on them,
waiting, awaiting some shrill sign, some cry,
some screaming cat that smells a sacrifice
and spells them thunder. Start the mumbling lips,
syllable by monotonous syllable,
that wash away the sullen griefs of love
and drown out knowledge of an ancient war—
o, ill-willed dark, give with the sound of rain,
let love be brought to ignorance again.

1213,Psalm to Be Read with Closed Eyes,D. Nurkse,"Ignorance will carry me through the last days,
the blistering cities, over briny rivers
swarming with jellyfish, as once my father
carried me from the car up the tacked carpet
to the white bed, and if I woke, I never knew it."
1214,Room,David Biespiel,"After it came in like a dark bird
Out of the snow, barely whistling
The notes father, mother, child,
It was hard to say what made us happiest.
 
Seeing the branches where it had learned
To stir the air? The air that opened
Without fear? Just the branches
And us in a room of wild things?
 
Like a shapeless flame, it flew
A dozen times around the room.
And, in a wink, a dozen more.
Into the wall, the window, the door.
 
You said the world turns to parts.
You said the parts are cunning spheres.
You said you always love the face of sin.
You said it’s here, the lips and eyes and skin.
 
Outside the snow deepened
With heaves of discontent.
Inside, the tremor of our life
Flew in and in and in."
1215,"Sick to death of the hardpan shoulder,",Greg Glazner,"the froth of noise
the undersides of the cedars make,

the windblown dark that hints
and fails for hours at effacement—
maybe I could claim it isn’t

praying, but it’s asking,
at the least, begging
that these lungfuls of this blackness

eat whatever keeps on swelling
and collapsing in my chest, and be done
with it, no more noise

left hanging in the spaces
between brake lights than a smothered rush
that sounds like suffering

and is nothing. Instead a sobbing isn’t
so much easing from my throat
as shining like black light from my torso,

veining the leaves of weeds, stoning
the whole roadside in a halo—I can feel
the heat of truck lights on my back,

I’m inside that brilliant gravity,
I think of time, I’m in the driver’s
nightmare and it shudders by—"
1216,Small Prayer,Weldon Kees,"Change, move, dead clock, that this fresh day
May break with dazzling light to these sick eyes.
Burn, glare, old sun, so long unseen,
That time may find its sound again, and cleanse
Whatever it is that a wound remembers
After the healing ends.

1217,Spring Reign,Dean Young,"Thank you whoever tuned the radio
to rain, thank you who spilled
the strong-willed wine for not
being me so I’m not to blame. I’m glad

I’m not that broken tree although
it looks sublime. And glad I’m not 
taking a test and running out of time.
What’s a tetrahedron anyway? What’s

the sublime, 3,483 divided by 9,
the tenth amendment, the ferryman’s name
on the River Styx? We’re all missing
more and more tricks, losing our grips,

guilty of crimes we didn’t commit.
The horse rears and races then moves no more,
the sports coupe grinds to a stop, beginning
a new life as rot, beaten to shit, Whitman

grass stain, consciousness swamp gas,
the bones and brain, protoplasm and liver,
ground down like stones in a river. Or does
the heart’s cinder wash up as delta froth

out of which hops frog spawn, dog song,
the next rhyming grind, next kid literati?
Maybe the world’s just a bubble, all 
philosophy ants in a muddle,

an engine inside an elk’s skull on a pole.
Maybe an angel’s long overdue and we’re
all in trouble. Meanwhile thanks whoever
for the dial turned to green downpour, thanks

for feathery conniptions at the seashore
and moth-minded, match-flash breath.
Thank you for whatever’s left."
1218,Sunflowers,José Antonio Rodríguez,"No pitying/“Ah” for this one —Alan Shapiro

No, nor a fierce hurrah
for what it does without choice,
for following the light
for the same reason the light follows it.

Just a thing rough to the touch, a face
like a thousand ticks turning their backs,
suckling at something you can’t see,
and a body like a tag off the earth

so that my child hands couldn’t tear it out
from the overgrown lot next door.
                           My palms raw with the shock
of quills and spines. Its hold like spite, and ugly

except when seen from a distance—
a whole field of them by the highway,
an 80-mile-per-hour view
                           like a camera’s flash.
All of them like halos
without saints to weigh them down."
1219,What the Dove Sings,Carol Frost,"The mourning dove
wearing noon’s aureole
coos from the rhododendron,
oo-waoh, shadow o-

And the sad rhetoric spreads
through suburb and wood.
Those who hear 
dove moan love no 
querulous warbling more—
the going hence 
about which is there no- 
thing to do? 
From no small rip in fate
the you you never shall be
more will be extracted.
Dove knows the rubric
and starts in, who, 
who is next and soon?"
1220,“You could lighten,Greg Glazner,"up a little,” he says,
shutting the rusted tailgate,
“maybe at least lean
down from your high horse 
and look busy,” picking up
his work gloves and his spade.

“You’re not the only
hick on the clock
with an education,” he says, half-
laughing, half-wheezing,
and spits, his bottom lip bulging
with a load of Skoal,“even 
if you do think pretty highly
of your poetry.”"
1221,You’re arrowing out toward what.,Greg Glazner,"The sunlight almost unfaceable, and weightless,
and the gravities, wind-flickers, shadows, the ripped
black places crows make on the phone poles—

how to keep your own counsel,
even against the little stabs, the winds and chromes—

                                              •

Various flashes, the office door, a supper glass, a last
smear of streetlight on the bedsheets.

Nothing. On into the soaring, black release.

The messages say syllabus and vetting that

On into the what? the air you’re gliding on
or falling from,
                              the wind of it making
ahs and salves in the hollow of your chest,
Celina of a bodily sibilance like willows, 
of the shimmering, midsummer glance.

You would allow yourself a message.
How to make it low-key. How to keep it to a few lines.

                                               •

On into the wind of whatever is happening.
What leashes you seems to have come undone.

You lean down into the white heap of black words.
You pad out toward the water fountain
into someone’s eyeshadowed look, the lush backwash of her skirt.

You weigh maybe three or four
ounces, swirling down the stairwell

in whichever wind this is, your ribs
aching with what they
sing so shamelessly."
1222,Audubon at Oakley Plantation,Rachel Richardson,"I need them true to life
and so I shoot them,
as many as fill the field at dawn,
and then fix wires
to prop them as if feeding their young
or bending to the river.
 
Why make a little book
when they exist life-sized,
can be etched to stand high as my hip?
Often have I wished
I had eight pairs of hands to hold them,
and another body for the gun."
1223,The Blind Man,Théophile Gautier,"A blind man, on the thoroughfare,
Startle-eyed as an owl by day,
Piping a dismal little air,
Taps here and there, loses his way,
 
Tootles awry his time-old ditty
Undauntedly, as by his side
Lopes his dog, guides him through the city,
Specter diurnal, sleepy-eyed.
 
Days, stark, wash over him, unlit;
He hears the dark world’s constant din
And all that life unseen, as it
Rolls, rushing, like a flood walled in!
 
God knows what black chimeras haunt
That brain opaque, what lot befalls;
And what dire spells the mind is wont
To scribble on those death-vault walls!
 
Like prisoner grown half-mad, who, pent,
Rots beneath Venice in her jail
Eternal, and whose hours are spent
Scratching a message with a nail...
 
But when the torch, in tomb immured,
Dies in the breath of death, maybe
The soul, to shades’ gloom long inured,
Will see with deathly clarity!"

1226,Farewell to Poetry,Théophile Gautier,"Come, fallen angel, and your pink wings close;
Doff your white robe, your rays that gild the skies;
You must—from heaven, where once you used to rise—
Streak, like a shooting star, fall into prose.
 
Your bird’s feet now must strike an earthly pose.
It is no time to fly: walk! Lock your prize—
Your harp’s fair harmonies—in resting wise,
Within your heart: vain, worthless treasures those!
 
Poor child of heaven, but vainly would you sing:
To them your tongue divine means not a thing!
Their ear is closed to your sweet chords! But this
 
I beg: O blue-eyed angel, first, before
You leave, find my pale love, whom I adore,
And give her brow one long, last farewell kiss."
1227,Frank O'Hara,Ted Berrigan,"Winter in the country, Southampton, pale horse
as the soot rises, then settles, over the pictures
The birds that were singing this morning have shut up
I thought I saw a couple kissing, but Larry said no
It’s a strange bird. He should know. & I think now
“Grandmother divided by monkey equals outer space.” Ron
put me in that picture. In another picture, a good-
looking poet is thinking it over, nevertheless, he will
never speak of that it. But, his face is open, his eyes
are clear, and, leaning lightly on an elbow, fist below
his ear, he will never be less than perfectly frank,
listening, completely interested in whatever there may
be to hear. Attentive to me alone here. Between friends,
nothing would seem stranger to me than true intimacy.
What seems genuine, truly real, is thinking of you, how
that makes me feel. You are dead. And you’ll never
write again about the country, that’s true.
But the people in the sky really love

1228,From the Bottom,Brian Henry,"“Burnished,” when applied to limbs,
refers you to furniture, or wood
at least, a hint the skin has been burned
beyond the human, & then beyond.
 
Necessary for the removal of skin
from a burnished limb is an implement
sharper rather than duller, wieldy
& willing to dig without displacement.
 
The scrape of flint on a burnished limb
—if you say “arm” you must mean it—
resembles, no doubt, a chisel (of iron?)
that furls what’s before it, away.
 
The point of whatever has been lost
between the stasis of the burnished limb
& its movement away from the rest
of what you have identified as skin,
 
the skin of a burnished limb,
is to bring to bear the thought of bone
& how it relates or, better, responds
to its covering uncurling from it

flake by flake & amassing, forceless,
on the floor, the floor you will describe
as cement or concrete, at least
rug- and wood-less, the wood being

the skin of the burnished limb,
until the skin is just another piece
of your household furniture."

White cemetery lilacs sprout
Over my temples; but soon, now,
The grove entire will bloom about
My head, to shade my withered brow.
 
Pallid, my sun sinks low, and will
Soon fade on the horizon’s face;
And on the mournful, doleful hill
I see my final dwelling-place.
 
Oh! May you from your lips let fall
A kiss, too long delayed, upon
My own, so that beneath my pall
I may rest, heart at peace, anon..."
1231,My Grandmother Plays Emily in Our Town,Rachel Richardson,"I
 
I am asking something gone
return: at least one night, her face
 
a girl’s, just twenty, and
to be married in a month,
 
holding the dress’s hem to her lips
as places are called. And I,
 
come along too late to know her
trembling, parting the curtain—
 
let me hear her now
perched on the ladder, recite
 
“But Mama, . . .
am I pretty enough . . . ?”

 
II
 
When Emily marries, ladies in hats
drown out the proper vows
 
—it’s what the play requires;
the everyday over the sacred. Even the set
 
is made of items found in the actors’ garages
so we always see back to the bones.
 
Here my grandmother stands at the altar
with her fictional George
 
and gossip swells in the pews
which are rows of folding chairs.
 
 
III
 
Among the murmuring departed,
in the cemetery,
 
my grandmother takes
her place at the empty plot.
 
She’s the newcomer
who can’t believe she’s dead
 
if the living roam
just on the crest of this hill.
 
My grandmother in white
poplin dress and hair ribbon
 
lifts her arms in despair—
Emily, untouched by the rain.
 
 
IV
 
Tomorrow her face will glow
on the cover of The Shreveport Times—
  
a gorgeous girl demanding her life.
“But oh!” she cries in Emily’s voice,
 
“I can go back there
and live all those days over again . . .”
 
 
V
 
So Emily steps back
into childhood
 
though the wiser dead
have told her don’t—
 
into her mother’s kitchen,
her twelfth birthday, a moment
 
she thought she was happy.
She watches now
 
that life: mother speaking
gruffly, father late to work.
 
Dead Emily kisses the cheek
of the classmate playing her mother—
 
understanding, in that kitchen,
they’d all been blind:
 
they never knew those people
they said they loved.
 
 
VI
 
My grandmother maintains
her grace to the end.
 
She is the queen of the theater;
all of Shreveport melts for her smile.
 
She holds her palms out
to feel the heavy drops as the curtains close,
 
though she knows this rain
is only the sound of rain."
1232,O,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"Oh, what a lantern, what a lamp of light

 As thou to me didst promise heretofore.
                  And this unforced praise
        I for an off’ring bring, accept, O Lord,
                  And show to me thy ways.
  
 What if my life lie naked in my hand,
        To every chance exposed!
 Should I forget what thou dost me command?
                  No, no, I will not stray
        From thy edicts though round about enclosed
                  With snares the wicked lay.
  
 Thy testimonies as mine heritage,
        I have retained still:
 And unto them my heart’s delight engage,
                  My heart which still doth bend,
        And only bend to do what thou dost will,
                  And do it to the end."
1233,[O my Lord],Rabi'a,"O my Lord,
 
if I worship you
from fear of hell, burn me in hell.
 
If I worship you
from hope of Paradise, bar me from its gates.
 
But if I worship you
for yourself alone, grant me then the beauty of your Face."
1234,[Of all that God has shown me],Mechthild of Magdeburg,"Of all that God has shown me
I can speak just the smallest word,
Nor more than a honey bee
Takes on his foot
From an overspilling jar."
1235,Petition,Dilruba Ahmed,"What god will catch me
when I’m down, when I’ve taken
sufficient drink to reveal
myself, when my words are little
more than a blurring
of consonant and vowel?
 
I’m drunk on spring:
branches of waxy leaves that
greet me at my driveway,
a family clutching
trays of sweets.
How can I sing of this?
 
If I cannot sing, then
make me mute. Or lend me
words, send me
the taste of another’s prayer,
cool as a coin
newly minted on the tongue."
1236,Psalm 150,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"Oh, laud the Lord, the God of hosts commend,
        Exalt his pow’r, advance his holiness:
        With all your might lift his almightiness;
 Your greatest praise upon his greatness spend.
  
 Make trumpet’s noise in shrillest notes ascend;
        Make lute and lyre his loved fame express;
        Him let the pipe, him let the tabret bless,
 Him organ’s breath, that winds or waters lend.
  
 Let ringing timbrels so his honor sound,
        Let sounding cymbals so his glory ring,
        That in their tunes such melody be found
 As fits the pomp of most triumphant king.
  
 Conclude: by all that air or life enfold,
        Let high Jehovah highly be extolled."
1237,Rooms,Brian Henry,"There are rooms that know you, rooms you know
& can name, rooms that rise & stutter
into view if you stare long enough.
Rooms where nothing happened
but in your head, where the world went on
apart from you, you trying to rise to it.
Rooms with walls of white blocks,
one window, the only sound the bang
bang banging of the headboard
against the wall, your bed still.
The room where the bed fell on you,
the room where the hand going down
was not your own, the groping tongue
the proof. The room you talked your way
out of, four men of monosyllables,
thick arms & necks flushed pink,
closing in, emptying the air between.
The room where you were walked in on,
the room where you were the walker,
both times the last time in that room.
The room with no door, a woman
across the threshold, you crawling to her,
over her to the bathroom to press your cheek
against the white, your name
an indictment among the stalls.
The room the sun never touched,
the sound of cars dropping you to sleep,
your pupils large & hungry for light."
1238,Seeding an Alphabet,Emily Warn,"To invent the alef-beit,
decipher the grammar of crows,
read a tangle of bare branches
with vowels of the last leaves
scrawling their jittery speech
on the sky’s pale page.
 
Choose a beginning.
See what God yields and dirt cedes
when tines disturb fescue, vetch, and sage,
when your hand dips grain from a sack,
scattering it among engraved furrows.
 
Beyond the hill, a plume of dust
where oxen track the hours.
Does God lead or follow or scout?
To answer, count to one again and again:
a red maple leaf and a yellow maple leaf
that wind rifles and rain shines until they let go,
blazing their scripted nothingness on air."

1240,Smoke,Théophile Gautier,"Over there, trees are sheltering
A hunchedback hut... A slum, no more...
Roof askew, walls and wainscoting
Falling away... Moss hides the door.
 
Only one shutter, hanging... But
Seeping over the windowsill,
Like frosted breath, proof that this hut,
This slum, is living, breathing still.
 
Corkscrew of smoke... A wisp of blue
Escapes the hovel, whose soul it is...
Rises to God himself, and who
Receives the news and makes it his."
1241,Study in Hands,Théophile Gautier,"I
 
 Imperia
  
I saw a plaster hand, on view
In sculptor’s studio, set apart...
Aspasia’s? Cleopatra’s?... Who?
This fragment’s human work of art?
 
Like lily silvered by the dawn,
Frozen in kiss of snow, its light
Loveliness dazzled me, and shone
In poetry of purest white.
 
Though pallid, wan, yet striking, it
Spread over velvet, graceful, slender
Fingers—delicate, exquisite—
Decked thick with rings of weighty splendor.
 
Thumb high, in serpentine-like pose,
Arched in a svelte and shapely line,
It lay, fine set, like one of those
Hands held with proud air Florentine.
 
Did it comb out the sultan’s beard
On jeweled caftan? Or, with twirls
And twistings, when Don Juan appeared,
Play in his lustrous, glistening curls?
 
A courtesan’s? A queen’s? Did this
Wrought hand a scepter wield? Which one?
The paragon of fleshly bliss?
Sovereignty’s beauteous paragon?
 
Doubtless, by little starts and fits,
It lit, poised, in its fluttering,
On the she-lion croup of its
Chimera-dream, caught on the wing;
 
The Empire’s fantasies; bombastic
Love of fantastic, sumptuous schemes;
Voluptuous frenzies orgiastic;
Impossible and futile dreams;
 
Wild tales; poetic escapades
Of hashish, Rhine-wine sorcery;
Dashing Bohemian cavalcades
On steeds unbridled, coursing free...
 
Such are the things the eyes divines
In that white book, by Venus written:
Blank palm where she has traced the signs
One reads, a-tremble, terror-smitten.

 Lacenaire
 
Close by, in contrast, lying there,
Encushioned, was the severed hand—
Pungent-embalmed—of Lacenaire,
Assassin and scourge of the land;
 
Curio most depraved! But, though
Repulsed, I reached and touched it, still
Barely cleansed of its horrors! Oh!
That flesh, red-downed and deathly chill!
 
Sallow hand, like a mummy’s wrought,
All yellowed, laid-out pharaoh-wise,
Spreading its faun-like fingers, taut,
As if to seize its tempting prize;
 
Exuding from their tips, an itching
Lusting for living flesh and gold,
About to writhe, convulsed, and twitching
Before their victims, as of old.
 
Vice clawed vile hieroglyph designs
Of heinous wrongs—most foul, most fell—
In all its wrinkles, all its lines,
Signs that the executioner knew well!
 
One see its scabrous deeds large writ
In the palm’s bestial creases, and
The boiling cauldron scalding it
With every crime at sin’s command;
 
Capri’s debauches libertine,
Of fleshpot brothels orgy-rife
Stained through with blot of blood and wine
Like the old Caesar’s blasé life.
 
At once both soft and savage, its
Shape shows a curious elegance,
A fearsome grace that counterfeits
The gladiator’s graceful stance!
 
Crime’s aristocracy! No plane,
No hammer’s labors ever made
Its flesh tough time and time again!
Its only tool, the dagger-blade...
 
Work’s honest calluses! For you
We look in vain, no sign we see:
Evil’s false poet, butcher true—
A Manfred of the gutter, he!"
1242,The Tabernacle,Emily Warn,"Hope fills me this morning as I fashion letters
into a tree that sighs, that stays put yet moves,
reaching to its limits, swaying and settling,
a compass pointing to its place on earth
where every morning it blocks the sun
for me, at work in my studio,
where I scratch and scrawl and loop
letters into shapes so I can enter the Tabernacle
of their bodies and hear each foot, each syllable
sending its roots to a depth as great as that tree’s,
which has been standing and rooting and swaying
long before I came to memorize its plain mystery,
its wide-bodied hull open to stars at night,
each a point that I lengthen into a letter
and each letter into a word, and with the words
build a Tabernacle for the ten most broken
and the ten most resonant words. I will place them
in an inner sanctum enclosed by hanging carpets,
and outside it, another space enclosed by carpets,
and outside it, another, so that those who wish
to read the words, to say them out loud,
must first pull one curtain back and step inside,
and then another, and another until they arrive
in a hushed space, a soundproofed, heavy quiet
where they come to know that which makes all things
                                                                     day after day,
and out of which the earth was made.
Stepping behind each curtain they learn
that the mystery of making is not a secret hidden within
but a series of moves, a sequence of steps,
outlined on a blueprint with notes and call-outs,
white on black, constellations in the night sky,
the primordial living Torah, circulating in the letters
as trees circulate light, capturing it with their leaves,
caching it within the soil, then drawing it back up,
watering the tallest branches with the radiant dark."
1243,Things to Do in New York (City),Ted Berrigan,"for Peter Schjeldahl

                       Wake up high up
                              frame bent & turned on
                       Moving slowly
                              & by the numbers
                       light cigarette
                       Dress in basic black
                              & reading a lovely old man’s book:

                watching the boats sail by
                the sun, like a monument,
                move slowly up the sky
                above the bloody rush:
 
break yr legs & break yr heart
kiss the girls & make them cry
loving the gods & seeing them die
 
                                         celebrate your own
                                    & everyone else’s birth:
 
                                    Make friends forever
                                    & go away"
1244,The Vanishing Point,Emily Warn,"You slow down to watch cumulus clouds stream across the


sky. You choose a more circuitous route home and pass a


tree with white bags tied around random apples. The apples


remind you of clouds, how each hangs in the sky, singular


yet part of a flock. Each item in the flock is a coordinate of


earth and sky, enumerating space. The flocks of apples and


clouds are actual infinities, an endless collection of discrete


items that one can conceivably count to the end. This is


different from potential infinity, which is the entirety of


infinity, an immeasurable continuum that is greater than the


sum of its parts. After your first glimpse, you are lonely for


more contraction of space around the light of your mind


contemplating what cannot be conceived. What cannot be


conceived this morning? The Army has found the larynx of


an Iraqi man that American soldiers slowly strangled to


death. His ribs, additional evidence for the trial, are still


missing. They are in a refrigerator in Washington, D.C.


These are discrete items; whereas how the passage of time


felt as the soldiers strangled him is a continuum of infinite


pain. And his words and songs and prayers and curses he


will never speak are an empty set."
1245,Psalm 102,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"O Lord, my praying hear;
                Lord, let my cry come to thine ear.
 Hide not thy face away,
        But haste, and answer me,
 In this my most, most miserable day,
        Wherein I pray and cry to thee.
  
                My days as smoke are past;
                My bones as flaming fuel waste,
 Mown down in me, alas.
        With scythe of sharpest pain.
 My heart is withered like the wounded grass;
        My stomach doth all food disdain.
  
                So lean my woes me leave,
                That to my flesh my bones do cleave;
 And so I bray and howl,
        As use to howl and bray
 The lonely pelican and desert owl,
        Like whom I languish long the day.
  
                I languish so the day, 
                The night in watch I waste away;
 Right as the sparrow sits,
        Bereft of spouse, or son,
 Which irked alone with dolor’s deadly fits
        To company will not be won.
  
                As day to day succeeds,
                So shame on shame to me proceeds
 From them that do me hate,
        Who of my wrack so boast,
 That wishing ill, they wish but my estate,
        Yet think they wish of ills the most.
  
                Therefore my bread is clay;
                Therefore my tears my wine allay.
 For how else should it be,
        Sith thou still angry art,
 And seem’st for naught to have advanced me,
        But me advanced to subvert?
  
                The sun of my life-days
                Inclines to west with falling rays,
 And I as hay am dried,
        While yet in steadfast seat
 Eternal thou eternally dost bide,
        Thy memory no years can fret.
  
                Oh, then at length arise;
                On Zion cast thy mercy’s eyes.
 Now is the time that thou
        To mercy shouldst incline
 Concerning her: O Lord, the time is now
        Thyself for mercy didst assign.
  
                Thy servants wait the day
                When she, who like a carcass lay
 Stretched forth in ruin’s bier,
        Shall so arise and live, 
 The nations all Jehova’s name shall fear,
        All kings to thee shall glory give.
  
                Because thou hast anew
                Made Zion stand, restored to view
 Thy glorious presence there,
        Because thou hast, I say,
 Beheld our woes and not refused to hear
        What wretched we did plaining pray,
  
                This of record shall bide
                To this and every age beside.
 And they commend thee shall
        Whom thou anew shall make,
 That from the prospect of thy heav’nly hall
        Thy eye of earth survey did take,
  
                Heark’ning to prisoners’ groans,
                And setting free condemned ones,
 That they, when nations come,
        And realms to serve the Lord,
 In Zion and in Salem might become
        Fit means his honor to record.
  
                But what is this if I
                In the mid way should fall and die?
 My God, to thee I pray,
        Who canst my prayer give.
 Turn not to night the noontide of my day,
        Since endless thou dost ageless live.
  
                The earth, the heaven stands
                Once founded, formed by thy hands:
 They perish, thou shalt bide;
        They old, as clothes shall wear,
 Till changing still, full change shall them betide,
        Unclothed of all the clothes they bear.
  
                But thou art one, still one:
                Time interest in thee hath none.
 Then hope, who godly be,
        Or come of godly race:
 Endless your bliss, as never ending he,
        His presence your unchanged place."
1246,Psalm 55,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"My God, most glad to look, most prone to hear,
         An open ear, oh, let my prayer find,
                And from my plaint turn not thy face away.
                Behold my gestures, hearken what I say,
         While uttering moans with most tormented mind,
 My body I no less torment and tear.
 For, lo, their fearful threat’nings would mine ear,
         Who griefs on griefs on me still heaping lay,
                A mark to wrath and hate and wrong assigned;
                Therefore, my heart hath all his force resigned
         To trembling pants; death terrors on me pray;
 I fear, nay, shake, nay, quiv’ring quake with fear.
  
 Then say I, oh, might I but cut the wind,
         Borne on the wing the fearful dove doth bear:
                Stay would I not, till I in rest might stay.
                Far hence, oh, far, then would I take my way
         Unto the desert, and repose me there,
 These storms of woe, these tempests left behind.
 But swallow them, O Lord, in darkness blind,
         Confound their counsels, lead their tongues astray,
                That what they mean by words may not appear.
                For mother Wrong within their town each where,
         And daughter Strife their ensigns so display,
 As if they only thither were confined.
  
 These walk their city walls both night and day;
         Oppressions, tumults, guiles of every kind
                Are burgesses and dwell the middle near;
                About their streets his masking robes doth wear
         Mischief clothed in deceit, with treason lined,
 Where only he, he only bears the sway.
 But not my foe with me this prank did play,
         For then I would have borne with patient cheer
                An unkind part from whom I know unkind,
                Nor he whose forehead Envy’s mark had signed,
         His trophies on my ruins sought to rear,
 From whom to fly I might have made assay.
  
 But this to thee, to thee impute I may,
         My fellow, my companion, held most dear,
                My soul, my other self, my inward friend:
                Whom unto me, me unto whom did bind
         Exchanged secrets, who together were
 God’s temple wont to visit, there to pray.
 Oh, let a sudden death work their decay,
         Who speaking fair such cankered malice mind,
                Let them be buried breathing in their bier;
                But purple morn, black ev’n, and midday clear
         Shall see my praying voice to God inclined,
 Rousing him up, and naught shall me dismay.
  
 He ransomed me; he for my safety fined
         In fight where many sought my soul to slay;
                He, still himself to no succeeding heir
                Leaving his empire shall no more forbear
         But at my motion, all these atheists pay,
 By whom, still one, such mischiefs are designed.
 Who but such caitiffs would have undermined,
         Nay, overthrown, from whom but kindness mere
                They never found? Who would such trust betray?
                What buttered words! Yet war their hearts bewray.
         Their speech more sharp than sharpest sword or spear
 Yet softer flows than balm from wounded rind.
  
 But my o’erloaden soul, thyself upcheer,
         Cast on God’s shoulders what thee down doth weigh
                Long borne by thee with bearing pained and pined:
                To care for thee he shall be ever kind;
         By him the just in safety held away
 Changeless shall enter, live, and leave the year:
 But, Lord, how long shall these men tarry here?
         Fling them in pit of death where never shined
                The light of life, and while I make my stay
                On thee, let who their thirst with blood allay
         Have their life-holding thread so weakly twined
 That it, half-spun, death may in sunder shear."
1247,Psalm 57,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"Thy mercy, Lord, Lord, now thy mercy show:
                                          On thee I lie;
                                          To thee I fly.
                          Hide me, hive me, as thine own,
                          Till these blasts be overblown,
 Which now do fiercely blow.
  
 To highest God I will erect my cry,
                                          Who quickly shall
                                          Dispatch this all.
                          He shall down from heaven send
                          From disgrace me to defend
 His love and verity.
  
 My soul encaged lies with lions’ brood,
                                          Villains whose hands
                                          Are fiery brands,
                          Teeth more sharp than shaft or spear,
                          Tongues far better edge do bear
 Than swords to shed my blood.
  
 As high as highest heav’n can give thee place,
                                           O Lord, ascend,
                                           And thence extend
                          With most bright, most glorious show
                          Over all the earth below,
 The sunbeams of thy face.
  
 Me to entangle every way I go
                                          Their trap and net
                                           Is ready set.
                          Holes they dig but their own holes
                          Pitfalls make for their own souls:
 So, Lord, oh, serve them so.
  
 My heart prepared, prepared is my heart
                                          To spread thy praise
                                          With tuned lays:
                          Wake my tongue, my lute awake,
                          Thou my harp the consort make,
 Myself will bear a part.
  
 Myself when first the morning shall appear,
                                          With voice and string
                                          So will thee sing:
                          That this earthly globe, and all
                          Treading on this earthly ball,
 My praising notes shall hear.
  
 For god, my only God, thy gracious love
                                          Is mounted far
                                          Above each star,
                          Thy unchanged verity
                          Heav’nly wings do lift as high
 As clouds have room to move.
  
 As high as highest heav’n can give thee place,
                                          O Lord, ascend
                                          And thence extend
                          With most bright, most glorious show
                          Over all the earth below,
 The sunbeams of thy face."
1248,Psalm 84,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"How lovely is thy dwelling,
 Great god, to whom all greatness is belonging!
        To view thy courts far, far from any telling
 My soul doth long and pine with longing
                  Unto the God that liveth,
                  The God that all life giveth,
        My heart and body both aspire,
        Above delight, beyond desire.
  
        Alas, the sparrow knoweth
 The house where free and fearless she resideth;
        Directly to the nest the swallow goeth,
 Where with her sons she safe abideth.
                 Oh, altars thine, most mighty
                  In war, yea, most almighty:
        Thy altars, Lord, ah, why should I
        From altars thine excluded lie?
  
        Oh, happy who remaineth
 Thy household-man and still thy praise unfoldeth!
        Oh, happy who himself on thee sustaineth,
 Who to thy house his journey holdeth!
                  Me seems I see them going
                  Where mulberries are growing:
        How wells they dig in thirsty plain,
        And cisterns make for falling rain.
  
        Me seems I see augmented
 Still troop with troop, till all at length discover
        Zion, where to their sight is represented
 The Lord of hosts, the Zion lover.
                  O Lord, O God, most mighty
                  In war, yea, most almighty:
        Hear what I beg; hearken, I say,
        O Jacob’s God, to what I pray.
  
        Thou art the shield us shieldeth:
 Then, Lord, behold the face of thine anointed
        One day spent in thy courts more comfort yieldeth
 Than thousands otherwise appointed.
                  I count it clearer pleasure
                  To spend my age’s treasure
        Waiting a porter at thy gates
        Than dwell a lord with wicked mates.
  
        Thou art the sun that shineth;
 Thou art the buckler, Lord that us defendeth:
        Glory and grace Jehovah’s hand assigneth
 And good without refusal sendeth
                  To him who truly treadeth
                  The path to pureness leadeth.
        O Lord of might, thrice blessed he
        Whose confidence is built on thee."
1249,[The Doleful Lay of Clorinda],Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"Ay me, to whom shall I my case complain,
 That may compassion my impatient grief?
 Or where shall I unfold my inward pain,
 That my enriven heart may find relief?
           Shall I unto the heavenly pow’rs it show,
           Or unto earthly men that dwell below?
  
 To heavens? Ah, they, alas, the authors were,
 And workers of my unremedied woe:
 For they foresee what to us happens here,
 And they foresaw, yet suffered this be so.
           From them comes good, from them comes also ill,
           That which they made, who can them warn to spill.
  
 To men? Ah, they, alas, like wretched be,
 And subject to the heavens’ ordinance:
 Bound to abide whatever they decree.
 Their best redress is their best sufferance.
           How then can they, like wretched, comfort me,
           The which no less need comforted to be?
  
 Then to myself will I my sorrow mourn, 
 Sith none alive like sorrowful remains:
 And to myself my plaints shall back return,
 To pay their usury with doubled pains.
           The woods, the hills, the rivers shall resound
           The mournful accent of my sorrow’s ground.
  
 Woods, hills, and rivers now are desolate,
 Sith he is gone the which them all did grace:
 And all the fields do wail their widow state,
 Sith death their fairest flow’r did late deface.
           The fairest flow’r in field that ever grew,
           Was Astrophel; that was, we all may rue.
  
 What cruel hand of cursed foe unknown,
 Hath cropped the stalk which bore so fair a flow’r?
 Untimely cropped, before it well were grown,
 And clean defaced in untimely hour.
           Great loss to all that ever him did see,
           Great loss to all, but greatest loss to me.
  
 Break now your garlands, O ye shepherds’ lasses,
 Sith the fair flow’r, which them adorned, is gone:
 The flow’r, which them adorned, is gone to ashes,
 Never again let lass put garland on.
           Instead of garland, wear sad cypress now,
           And bitter elder, broken from the bough.
  
 Ne ever sing the love-lays which he made:
 Who ever made such lays of love as he?
 Ne ever read the riddles, which he said
 Unto yourselves, to make you merry glee.  
           Your merry glee is now laid all abed,
           Your merry maker now, alas, is dead.
  
 Death, the devourer of all the world’s delight,
 Hath robbed you and reft from me my joy:
 Both you and me and all the world he quite
 Hath robbed of joyance, and left sad annoy.
           Joy of the world, and shepherds’ pride was he,
           Shepherds’ hope never like again to see.
  
 O Death, that hast us of such riches reft,
 Tell us at least, what hast thou with it done?
 What is become of him whose flow’r here left
 Is but the shadow of his likeness gone:
           Scarce like the shadow of that which he was,
           Naught like, but that he like a shade did pass.
  
 But that immortal spirit, which was decked
 With all the dowries of celestial grace:
 By sovereign choice from th’heavenly choirs select,
 And lineally derived from angels’ race,
           Oh, what is now of it become, aread.
           Ay me, can so divine a thing be dead?
  
 Ah no: it is not dead, ne can it die, 
 But lives for aye, in blissful Paradise:
 Where like a new-born babe it soft doth lie,
 In bed of lilies wrapped in tender wise,
           And compassed all about with roses sweet,
           And dainty violets from head to feet.
  
 There thousand birds all of celestial brood,
 To him do sweetly carol day and night:
 And with strange notes, of him well understood,
 Lull him asleep in angel-like delight;
           Whilst in sweet dream to him presented be
           Immortal beauties, which no eye may see.
  
 But he them sees and takes exceeding pleasure
 Of their divine aspects, appearing plain,
 And kindling love in him above all measure,
 Sweet love still joyous, never feeling pain.
           For what so goodly form he there doth see,
           He may enjoy from jealous rancor free.
  
 There liveth he in everlasting bliss,
 Sweet spirit never fearing more to die:
 Ne dreading harm from any foes of his,
 Ne fearing savage beasts’ more cruelty.
           Whilst we here, wretches, wail his private lack,
           And with vain vows do often call him back.
  
 But live thou there still happy, happy spirit,
 And give us leave thee here thus to lament:
 Not thee that dost thy heaven’s joy inherit,
 But our own selves that here in dole are drent.
           Thus do we weep and wail, and wear our eyes,
           Mourning in other’s, our own miseries."
1250,Psalm 51,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"O Lord, whose grace no limits comprehend;
          Sweet Lord, whose mercies stand from measure free;
 To me that grace, to me that mercy send,
          And wipe, O Lord, my sins from sinful me.
          Oh, cleanse, oh, wash, my foul iniquity;
                Cleanse still my spots, still wash away my stainings,
                Till stains and spots in me leave no remainings.
  
 For I, alas, acknowledging do know
          My filthy fault, my faulty filthiness
 To my soul’s eye incessantly doth show,
          Which done to thee, to thee I do confess,
          Just judge, true witness, that for righteousness
                Thy doom may pass against my guilt awarded,
                Thy evidence for truth may be regarded.
  
 My mother, lo, when I began to be,
          Conceiving me, with me did sin conceive:
 And as with living heat she cherished me,
          Corruption did like cherishing receive.
          But, lo, thy love to purest good doth cleave,
                And inward truth: which, hardly else discerned,
                My truant soul in thy hid school hath learned.
  
 Then as thyself to lepers hast assigned,
          With hyssop, Lord, thy hyssop, purge me so:
 And that shall cleanse the lepry of my mind.
          Make over me thy mercy’s streams to flow,
          So shall my whiteness scorn the whitest snow.
                To ear and heart send sounds and thoughts of gladness,
                That bruised bones may dance away their sadness.
  
 Thy ill-pleased eye from my misdeeds avert:
          Cancel the registers my sins contain:
 Create in me a pure, clean, spotless heart;
          Inspire a sprite where love of right may reign
          Ah, cast me not from thee; take not again
                Thy breathing grace; again thy comfort send me,
                And let the guard of thy free sprite attend me.
  
 So I to them a guiding hand will be,
          Whose faulty feet have wandered from thy way,
 And turned from sin will make return to thee,
          Whom turned from thee sin erst had led astray.
          O God, God of my health, oh, do away
                My bloody crime: so shall my tongue be raised
                To praise thy truth, enough cannot be praised.
  
 Unlock my lips, shut up with sinful shame:
          Then shall my mouth, O Lord, thy honor sing.
 For bleeding fuel for thy altar’s flame,
          To gain thy grace what boots it me to bring?
          Burt-off’rings are to thee no pleasant thing.
                The sacrifice that God will hold respected,
                Is the heart-broken soul, the sprite dejected.

Lastly, O Lord, how so I stand or fall,
          Leave not thy loved Zion to embrace;
 But with thy favor build up Salem’s wall,
          And still in peace, maintain that peaceful place.
          Then shalt thou turn a well-accepting face
                To sacred fires with offered gifts perfumed:
                Till ev’n whole calves on altars be consumed."
1251,To the Angel Spirit of the Most Excellent Sir Philip Sidney,Mary Sidney Herbert Countess of Pembroke,"(Variant printed in Samuel Daniel’s 1623 Works)

To thee, pure spirit, to thee alone addressed
 Is this joint work, by double interest thine,
 Thine by his own, and what is done of mine
 Inspired by thee, thy secret power impressed.
 My Muse with thine, itself dared to combine
 As mortal stuff with that which is divine:
 Let thy fair beams give luster to the rest

That Israel’s King may deign his own, transformed
 In substance no, but superficial ’tire;
 And English guised in some sort may aspire
 To better grace thee what the vulgar formed:
 His sacred tones, age after age admire;
 Nations grow great in pride and pure desire
 So to excel in holy rites performed.
  
 Oh, had that soul which honor brought to rest
 Too soon not left and reft the world of all
 What man could show, which we perfection call,
 This precious piece had sorted with the best.
 But ah, wide festered wounds that never shall
 Nor must be closed, unto fresh bleeding fall:
 Ah, memory, what needs this new arrest?
  
 Yet blessed grief, that sweetness can impart
 Since thou art blest! Wrongly do I complain:
 Whatever weights my heavy thoughts sustain
 Dear feels my soul for thee. I know my part
 Nor be my weakness to thy rites a stain,
 Rites to aright, life-blood would not refrain:
 Assist me, then, that life what thine did part.
  
 Time may bring forth what time hath yet suppressed
 In whom thy loss hath laid to utter waste;
 The wrack of time, untimely all defaced,
 Remaining as the tomb of life deceased,
 Where, in my heart the highest room thou hast;
 There, truly there, thy earthly being is placed,
 Triumph of death: in life how more than blest.
  
 Behold, oh, that thou were now to behold
 This finished long perfection’s part begun,
 The rest but pieced, as left by thee undone.
 Pardon blest soul, presumption overbold, 
 If love and zeal hath to this error run:
 ’Tis zealous love, love that hath never done,
 Nor can enough, though justly here controlled.
  
 But since it hath no other scope to go,
 Nor other purpose but to honor thee,
 That thine may shine, where all the Graces be;
 And that my thoughts (like smallest streams that flow,
 Pay to their sea, their tributary fee)
 Do strive, yet have no means to quit nor free
 That mighty debt of infinities I owe
  
 To thy great worth which time to times enroll,
 Wonder of men, sole born, sole of thy kind
 Complete in all, but heavenly was thy mind,
 For wisdom, goodness, sweetness, fairest soul:
 Too good to wish, too fair for earth, refined
 For heaven, where all true glory rests confined;
 And where but there no life without control?
  
 Oh, when from this account, this cast-up sum,
 This reck’ning made the audit of my woe,
 Sometime of rase my swelling passions know
 How work my thoughts, my sense is stricken dumb
 That would thee more than words could ever show,
 Which all fall short. Who knew thee best do know
 There lives no wit that may thy praise become.
  
 And rest fair monuments of thy fair fame,
 Though not complete. Nor can we reach, in thought,
 What on that goodly piece time would have wrought
 Had divers so spared that life (but life) to frame
 The rest. Alas, such loss! The world hath naught
 Can equal it, nor, oh, more grievance brought,
 Yet what remains must ever crown thy name.
  
           Receive these hymns, these obsequies receive,
           (If any mark of thy secret spirit thou bear)
           Made only thine, and no name else must wear.
           I can no more: Dear Soul, I take my leave;
           My sorrow strives to mount the highest sphere."
1252,“I Broke the Spell That Held Me Long”,William Cullen Bryant,"I broke the spell that held me long,
The dear, dear witchery of song.
I said, the poet’s idle lore
Shall waste my prime of years no more,
For Poetry, though heavenly born,
Consorts with poverty and scorn.

I broke the spell–nor deemed its power
Could fetter me another hour.
Ah, thoughtless! how could I forget
Its causes were around me yet?
For wheresoe’er I looked, the while,
Was Nature’s everlasting smile.

Still came and lingered on my sight
Of flowers and streams the bloom and light,
And glory of the stars and sun; –
And these and poetry are one.
They, ere the world had held me long,
Recalled me to the love of song."
1253,Mutation,William Cullen Bryant,"They talk of short-lived pleasure–be it so–
   Pain dies as quickly: stern, hard-featured pain 
Expires, and lets her weary prisoner go.
   The fiercest agonies have shortest reign;
   And after dreams of horror, comes again 
The welcome morning with its rays of peace.
   Oblivion, softly wiping out the stain,
Makes the strong secret pangs of shame to cease:
Remorse is virtue’s root; its fair increase
   Are fruits of innocence and blessedness:
Thus joy, o’erborne and bound, doth still release
   His young limbs from the chains that round him press. 
Weep not that the world changes–did it keep
A stable, changeless state, ’twere cause indeed to weep."
1254,The Snow-Shower,William Cullen Bryant,"Stand here by my side and turn, I pray, 
   On the lake below, thy gentle eyes;
The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray, 
   And dark and silent the water lies;
And out of that frozen mist the snow 
In wavering flakes begins to flow;
                            Flake after flake 
They sink in the dark and silent lake.

See how in a living swarm they come 
   From the chambers beyond that misty veil;
Some hover awhile in air, and some 
   Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.
All, dropping swiftly or settling slow, 
Meet, and are still in the depths below;
                            Flake after flake 
Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.

Here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud, 
   Come floating downward in airy play,
Like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd 
   That whiten by night the milky way;
There broader and burlier masses fall; 
The sullen water buries them all–
                            Flake after flake–
All drowned in the dark and silent lake.

And some, as on tender wings they glide 
   From their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray,
Are joined in their fall, and, side by side, 
   Come clinging along their unsteady way;
As friend with friend, or husband with wife, 
Makes hand in hand the passage of life;
                            Each mated flake 
Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.

Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste 
   Stream down the snows, till the air is white,
As, myriads by myriads madly chased, 
They fling themselves from their shadowy height.
   The fair, frail creatures of middle sky, 
What speed they make, with their grave so nigh;
                            Flake after flake, 
To lie in the dark and silent lake!

I see in thy gentle eyes a tear; 
   They turn to me in sorrowful thought;
Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear, 
   Who were for a time, and now are not;
Like these fair children of cloud and frost, 
That glisten a moment and then are lost,
                            Flake after flake–
All lost in the dark and silent lake.

Yet look again, for the clouds divide; 
   A gleam of blue on the water lies;
And far away, on the mountain-side, 
   A sunbeam falls from the opening skies,
But the hurrying host that flew between 
The cloud and the water, no more is seen;
                            Flake after flake, 
At rest in the dark and silent lake."
1255,Summer Wind,William Cullen Bryant,"It is a sultry day; the sun has drunk
The dew that lay upon the morning grass;
There is no rustling in the lofty elm
That canopies my dwelling, and its shade
Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint
And interrupted murmur of the bee,
Settling on the sick flowers, and then again
Instantly on the wing. The plants around
Feel the too potent fervors: the tall maize
Rolls up its long green leaves; the clover droops
Its tender foliage, and declines its blooms.
But far in the fierce sunshine tower the hills,
With all their growth of woods, silent and stern,
As if the scorching heat and dazzling light
Were but an element they loved. Bright clouds,
Motionless pillars of the brazen heaven–
Their bases on the mountains–their white tops
Shining in the far ether–fire the air
With a reflected radiance, and make turn
The gazer’s eye away. For me, I lie
Languidly in the shade, where the thick turf,
Yet virgin from the kisses of the sun,
Retains some freshness, and I woo the wind
That still delays his coming. Why so slow,
Gentle and voluble spirit of the air?
Oh, come and breathe upon the fainting earth
Coolness and life! Is it that in his caves
He hears me? See, on yonder woody ridge,
The pine is bending his proud top, and now
Among the nearer groves, chestnut and oak
Are tossing their green boughs about. He comes;
Lo, where the grassy meadow runs in waves!
The deep distressful silence of the scene
Breaks up with mingling of unnumbered sounds
And universal motion. He is come,
Shaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubs,
And bearing on their fragrance; and he brings
Music of birds, and rustling of young boughs,
And sound of swaying branches, and the voice
Of distant waterfalls. All the green herbs
Are stirring in his breath; a thousand flowers,
By the road-side and the borders of the brook,
Nod gayly to each other; glossy leaves
Are twinkling in the sun, as if the dew
Were on them yet, and silver waters break
Into small waves and sparkle as he comes."
1256,I Was Never Able To Pray,Edward Hirsch,"Wheel me down to the shore
where the lighthouse was abandoned
and the moon tolls in the rafters.

Let me hear the wind paging through the trees
and see the stars flaring out, one by one,
like the forgotten faces of the dead.

I was never able to pray,
but let me inscribe my name
in the book of waves

and then stare into the dome
of a sky that never ends
and see my voice sail into the night."
1257,The New Dentist,Jaimee Kuperman,"Driving to the new dentist’s office
the slow drive of a new place
with the McDonalds that I don’t go to
on the left, the mall two miles away.
The Courthouse and the Old Courthouse
road signs that break apart, the fork in the road
that looks nothing like a fork or a spoon, in fact
at best, maybe a knife bent in a dishwasher
that leans to one side. And I know the dentist
will ask about my last visit and want to know
in months that I can’t say some time ago
and I know he will ask me about flossing
and saying when I’m in the mood won’t be
the appropriate answer.
He will call out my cavities
as if they were names in a class.
I brush my teeth before going in.
It’s like cleaning before the cleaning person
but I don’t want him to know I keep an untidy
mouth. That I am the type of person who shoves
things in the closet before guests arrive."
1258,Ode to Himself [“Come leave the loathéd stage”],Ben Jonson,"Come leave the loathéd stage,
          And the more loathsome age,
 Where pride and impudence in faction knit
          Usurp the chair of wit, 
 Indicting and arraigning, every day,
          Something they call a play. 
      Let their fastidious, vain
      Commission of the brain
 Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condemn:
 They were not made for thee, less thou for them.
  
          Say that thou pour’st ’em wheat,
          And they would acorns eat;
 ‘Twere simple fury, still thyself to waste
          On such as have no taste;
 To offer them a surfeit of pure bread,
          Whose appetites are dead;
      No, give them grains their fill,
      Husks, draff to drink, and swill;
 If they love lees, and leave the lusty wine,
 Envy them not, their palate’s with the swine.
  
          No doubt a moldy tale,
          Like Pericles, and stale
 As the shrive’s crusts, and nasty as his fish,
          Scraps out of every dish
 Thrown forth, and raked into the common tub,
          May keep up the Play Club.
      Broome’s sweepings do as well
      There as his master’s meal;
 For who the relish of these guests will fit
 Needs set them but the alms-basket of wit.
  
          And much good do’t ye then,
          Brave plush and velvet men
 Can feed on orts, and safe in your scene clothes,
          Dare quit upon your oaths
 The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peers)
          Of stuffing your large ears
      With rage of comic socks, 
      Wrought upon twenty blocks;
 Which, if they’re torn, and foul, and patched enough,
 The gamesters share your guilt, and you their stuff.
  
          Leave things so prostitute,
          And take th’Alcaic lute;
 Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon’s lyre;
          Warm thee by Pindar’s fire;
 And though thy nerves be shrunk, and blood be cold,
          Ere years have made thee old,
      Strike that disdainful heat
      Throughout, to their defeat;
 As curious fools, and envious of thy stain,
 May, blushing, swear no palsy’s in thy brain.
  
          But when they hear thee sing
          The glories of thy King,
 His zeal to God, and his just awe of men,
          They may be blood-shaken, then
 Feel such a flesh-quake to possess their powers,
          That no tuned harp like ours,
      In sound of peace or wars,
      Shall truly hit the stars
 When they shall read the acts of Charles his reign,
 And see his chariot triumph ’bove his wain."
1259,Dhaka Dust,Dilruba Ahmed,"Can’t occupy the same space at the same time
unless, of course, you land in Dhaka, rickshaws
 
five or six abreast. They are all here:
studded metal backboards ablaze with red flowers,
 
Heineken boxes, a Bangladeshi star with blue eyes,
peacocks, pink fans of filigree. The drivers sweat
 
and strain in the plaid lungis, and each face
seems to say Allah takes and Allah
  
 gives. A woman breathes into her green shawl
against the dust on the road’s median. A man
 
with a plaid scarf (surplus from The Gap)
slaps the rump of a passing gray car
 
as though it’s a horse or a dog. You are there, too,
your maroon sleeves begin to stick
 
despite your deodorant. Under your orna,
a laminated map and digital camera
 
cradled in your lap. One strand of silver
wiry by your ear. Bits of children’s songs
 
snag in your windpipe. Other words surface:
 sweatshop and abject poverty, and you let them.
 
They mix with the low rumbling that began
on the plane, ms and bs tumbling, amplified
 
in the streets: the rickshaw bells’ light metal,
the nasal peal of horns. On this continent,
 
the ocean’s giant tongue has swept away
miles of coastline, and bodies flood the water.
 
Dust sifts into your lungs and sinks—feline,
black, to remain long after you leave."
1260,First Miracle,A.E. Stallings,"Her body like a pomegranate torn
Wide open, somehow bears what must be born,

The irony where a stranger small enough
To bed down in the ox-tongue-polished trough

Erupts into the world and breaks the spell
Of the ancient, numbered hours with his yell.

Now her breasts ache and weep and soak her shirt
Whenever she hears his hunger or his hurt;

She can’t change water into wine; instead
She fashions sweet milk out of her own blood."
1261,Mr. D Shops At Fausto’s Food Palace,Candace Black,"For years he lived close enough to smell
chicken and bananas rotting
in the trash bins, to surprise a cashier on break
smoking something suspicious when he walked
 
 out the back gate. Did they have an account?
He can’t remember. Probably so, for all the milk
a large family went through, the last-minute
ingredients delivered by a smirking bag boy.
 
 He liked to go himself, the parking lot’s
radiant heat erased once he got past the sweating
glass door, to troll the icy aisles in his slippers.
This was before high-end labels took over
 
 shelf space, before baloney changed
its name to mortadella, before water
came in flavors, before fish
got flown in from somewhere else."
1262,Rental Tux,William Trowbridge,"It chafed like some new skin we’d grown,
or feathers, the cummerbund and starched collar
pinching us to show how real this transformation
into princes was, how powerful we’d grown
by getting drivers’ licenses, how tall and total
our new perspective, above that rusty keyhole
parents squinted through. We’d found the key:
that nothing really counts except a romance
bright as Technicolor, wide as Cinerama,
and this could be the night. No lie."
1263,Trees,Joyce Kilmer,"I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree."
1264,After a Greek Proverb,A.E. Stallings,"Ουδέν μονιμότερον του προσωρινού

We’re here for the time being, I answer to the query—
Just for a couple of years, we said, a dozen years back.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.

We dine sitting on folding chairs—they were cheap but cheery.
We’ve taped the broken window pane. tv’s still out of whack.
We’re here for the time being, I answer to the query.

When we crossed the water, we only brought what we could carry,
But there are always boxes that you never do unpack.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.

Sometimes when I’m feeling weepy, you propose a theory:
Nostalgia and tear gas have the same acrid smack.
We’re here for the time being, I answer to the query—

We stash bones in the closet when we don’t have time to bury,
Stuff receipts in envelopes, file papers in a stack.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.

Twelve years now and we’re still eating off the ordinary:
We left our wedding china behind, afraid that it might crack.
We’re here for the time being, we answer to the query,
But nothing is more permanent than the temporary."
1265,Afterword,Louise Glück,"Reading what I have just written, I now believe
I stopped precipitously, so that my story seems to have been
slightly distorted, ending, as it did, not abruptly
but in a kind of artificial mist of the sort
sprayed onto stages to allow for difficult set changes.

Why did I stop? Did some instinct
discern a shape, the artist in me
intervening to stop traffic, as it were?

A shape. Or fate, as the poets say,
intuited in those few long ago hours—

I must have thought so once.
And yet I dislike the term
which seems to me a crutch, a phase,
the adolescence of the mind, perhaps—

Still, it was a term I used myself,
frequently to explain my failures.
Fate, destiny, whose designs and warnings
now seem to me simply
local symmetries, metonymic
baubles within immense confusion—

Chaos was what I saw.
My brush froze—I could not paint it.

Darkness, silence: that was the feeling.

What did we call it then?
A “crisis of vision” corresponding, I believed,
to the tree that confronted my parents,

but whereas they were forced
forward into the obstacle,
I retreated or fled—

Mist covered the stage (my life).
Characters came and went, costumes were changed,
my brush hand moved side to side
far from the canvas,
side to side, like a windshield wiper.

Surely this was the desert, the dark night.
(In reality, a crowded street in London,
the tourists waving their colored maps.)

One speaks a word: I.
Out of this stream
the great forms—

I took a deep breath. And it came to me
the person who drew that breath
was not the person in my story, his childish hand
confidently wielding the crayon—

Had I been that person? A child but also
an explorer to whom the path is suddenly clear, for whom
the vegetation parts—

And beyond, no longer screened from view, that exalted
solitude Kant perhaps experienced
on his way to the bridges—
(We share a birthday.)

Outside, the festive streets
were strung, in late January, with exhausted Christmas lights.
A woman leaned against her lover’s shoulder
singing Jacques Brel in her thin soprano—

Bravo! the door is shut.
Now nothing escapes, nothing enters—

I hadn’t moved. I felt the desert
stretching ahead, stretching (it now seems)
on all sides, shifting as I speak,

so that I was constantly
face to face with blankness, that
stepchild of the sublime,

which, it turns out,
has been both my subject and my medium.

What would my twin have said, had my thoughts
reached him?

Perhaps he would have said
in my case there was no obstacle (for the sake of argument)
after which I would have been
referred to religion, the cemetery where
questions of faith are answered.

The mist had cleared. The empty canvases
were turned inward against the wall.

The little cat is dead (so the song went).

Shall I be raised from death, the spirit asks.
And the sun says yes.
And the desert answers
your voice is sand scattered in wind."
1266,Among the Gorgons,Michelle Boisseau,"For Eleanor

For seventeen years I was caught in the surf.
Drubbed and scoured, I’d snatch a breath
and be jerked down again, dragged across 
broken shells and shingle. I loved it,
mostly, the need, how I fed the frantic.

I’d skipped into that sea. Certainly not
a girl, but I could still turn a head as I took
the foam between my thighs. 
Then it was over.

                                Hiss of a match 
snuffed with spit. The sea had trotted off.
I stood in the stink of flapping fish.
At first it stung. A galaxy of dimes 
eyed my sag and crinkles and dismissed 
me like a canceled stamp,

but something tugged at me, silver braids
weaving and unweaving themselves
and either the path was shrinking
or I was getting bigger, for soon the way
was just a hair, the extra bit of wit

a grandma leaves on her chin
to scare the boys, and it led me 
into a cave crackling like a woodstove
with laughter. 

                            A landslide opened 
a seam of rubies and we stepped inside."
1267,Ancestral Lines,David Ferry,"It’s as when following the others’ lines,
Which are the tracks of somebody gone before,
Leaving me mischievous clues, telling me who

They were and who it was they weren’t,
And who it is I am because of them,
Or, just for the moment, reading them, I am,

Although the next moment I’m back in myself, and lost.
My father at the piano saying to me, 
“Listen to this, he called the piece Warum?”

And the nearest my father could come to saying what
He made of that was lamely to say he didn’t,
Schumann didn’t, my father didn’t, know why.

“What’s in a dog’s heart”? I once asked in a poem,
And Christopher Ricks when he read it said, “Search me.”
He wasn’t just being funny, he was right.

You can’t tell anything much about who you are
By exercising on the Romantic bars.
What are the wild waves saying? I don’t know.

And Shelley didn’t know, and knew he didn’t.
In his great poem, “Ode to the West Wind,” he
Said that the leaves of his pages were blowing away,

Dead leaves, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing."
1268,"C.P. Cavafy, Thermopylae",David Ferry,"Honor is due to those who are keeping watch,
Sentinels guarding their own Thermopylae;
Never distracted from what is right to do,
And right to be; in all things virtuous,
But never so hardened by virtue as not to be
     
Compassionate, available to pity;
Generous if they’re rich, but generous too,
Doing whatever they can, if they are poor;
Always true to the truth, no matter what,
But never scornful of those who have to lie.

Even more honor is due when, keeping watch,
They see that the time will come when Ephialtes 
Will tell the secret to the Medes and they
Will know the way to get in through the goat-path."
1269,Catullus I,David Ferry,"To Cornelius Nepos

Who is it I should give my little book to,
So pretty in its pumice-polished covers?

Cornelius, I’ll give my book to you:
Because you used to think my nothings somethings,

At the time when you were the first in Italy
To dare to write our whole long history,

Three volumes, under the sign of Jupiter,
Heroically achieved; so take this little

Book of mine for what it’s worth; whatever;
And oh, patroness Virgin, grant that it shall

Live and survive beyond the century."
1270,Coffee Lips,David Ferry,"The guest who came in to the street people’s suppers last night,
An elderly man with a lost smart little boy’s face and a look

As if he might turn against you anytime soon,
As if he’d just come into this world and he was extremely 

Wary about what the world was going to be, and he said, 
“If I ask you a question will you give me a truthful answer?” 

And I said, “That depends on what the question is,” 
Thinking the little elderly boy looked sophisticated and

As if he’d in fact been a long time in the world 
And would get the tone right, and maybe he did, or maybe he didn’t;

At any rate he went on to ask the question,
“When I come into places like this and there are people holding

Coffee cups to their lips and they look at me,
Are they about to drink the coffee or not to drink the coffee?”

He was balancing the world on the tip of his witty unknowing nose.
I felt like I was falling down someplace else than anywhere there."
1271,"Convinced, 1957",Kathryn Starbuck,"At last I was convinced that giving in to their thinking represented a huge error in the evolution of my family affairs. Riven with a savage melancholy, not permitted out of the house without two minders—one armed with needle sedative, the other armed with arms—I armed myself with myself and threw off the vulgar superstition and reactionary domination that had up to then poisoned my mental library, imprisoning me, making me believe, with them, that I must have children when I knew that I must not, would not.    And I did not."
1272,Dear Drought,Amy Beeder,"Offer your usual posy of goatheads. Proffer
sharp garlands of thistle & Incas’ thin down;
of squash bugs strung on blighted stems; send

back necklaced every reeking pearl I crushed, 

each egg cluster that I scraped away with knife
or twig or thumbnail. Wake me sweat-laced
from a dream of hidden stables: the gentle foals 

atremble, stem-legged, long-neglected. Dear
drought our summer’s corn was overrun again
with weed & cheat; the bitter zinnias fell to bits.

Dear yearlings our harvest is lattice & husk."
1273,Death Gets into the Suburbs,Michelle Boisseau,"It sweats into the tongue and groove
of redwood decks with a Tahoe view.
It slides under the truck where some knuckles

are getting banged up on a stuck nut.
It whirls in the egg whites. Among blacks
and whites spread evenly. Inside the chicken

factory, the Falcon 7x, and under the bridge.

There’s death by taxi, by blood clot, by slippery rug.
Death by oops and flood, by drone and gun.

Death with honor derides death without. 
Realpolitik and offshore accounts
are erased like a thumb drive lost in a fire.

And the friendly crow sets out walnuts to pop under tires.

So let’s walk the ruins, let’s walk along the ocean
and listen to death’s undying devotion."
1274,Epic Simile,A.E. Stallings,"For Rachel

Right shoulder aching with day-long butchery,
Left shoulder numb with dints clanged on the shield,
The hero is fouled with blood, his own and others’,
First slick, then sticky, then caked, starting to mat
His beard—the armor deadweight all around him;
His teeth grit and rattle with every jolt
Of bronze-rimmed wheels behind the shit-flecked horses.
But when he glimpses the mountains, the distant snow,
A blankness swoons upon him, and he hears
Nothing but the white vowels of the wind
Brushing through stands of spears like conifers
While a banner slips its staff and hangs in the blue
Like a kestrel or a contrail. The hero’s death,
The prize, elusive quarry of his life,
Stands stock-still in her cloven tracks in snow
And turns, one ear tuned to the creek’s far bank,
One dished towards him. Her unstartled gaze
Beads on him like a sniper’s sights, until
At the clean report of a cracking poplar branch,
She leaps away like luck, over rapid water,
And snowfall scrims the scene like a mist of tears,
Like a migraine, like sweat or blood streaming into your eyes."
1275,Hard Times,Michael Ryan,"The lousy job my father lands
I’m tickled pink to celebrate.
My mother’s rosary-pinching hands
stack pigs in blankets on a plate.

Teeny uncircumcised Buddha penises
(cocktail hot dogs in strips of dough):
I gobble these puffed-up weenie geniuses
as if they’d tell me what I need to know

to get the fuck out of here.
They don’t only stink of fear.
They’re doom and shame and dumb pig fate.
I tell my mom I think they’re great.

Dad chews his slowly with a pint of gin,
and says he eats a whole shit deal
because of us. My mom’s in tears again.
I don’t know who to hate or how to feel."
1276,"In Love, His Grammar Grew",Stephen Dunn,"In love, his grammar grew 
rich with intensifiers, and adverbs fell
madly from the sky like pheasants 
for the peasantry, and he, as sated
as they were, lolled under shade trees
until roused by moonlight 
and the beautiful fraternal twins 
and and but. Oh that was when
he knew he couldn’t resist
a conjunction of any kind.
One said accumulate, the other
was a doubter who loved the wind
and the mind that cleans up after it.
                                           For love
he wanted to break all the rules, 
light a candle behind a sentence
named Sheila, always running on
and wishing to be stopped
by the hard button of a period. 
Sometimes, in desperation, he’d look
toward a mannequin or a window dresser
with a penchant for parsing.
But mostly he wanted you, Sheila,
and the adjectives that could precede
and change you: bluesy, fly-by-night,
queen of all that is and might be."
1277,Incubus,David Ferry,"At the supper for street people

The young man who goes about all muffled up from harm,
With whatever he has found, newspaper pages
Carefully folded to make a weirdly festive 
Hat or hood, down almost over his eyes.
Everything carefully arranged to make him other.
The paper-covered razor blade in his mouth, 
Or the bit of wood, like carrying a message.

A fantasy so clever, outwitting itself, 
That it became what it was he was, and so 
He was what it was. The long loose shirt too big 
For him, the pantaloons too big for him 
Loose like the pantaloons of the circus clown,
Some kind of jacket too big, he got it somewhere.
His burden slept dreaming everywhere upon him.
As if his whole body and the clothes he wore dreamed
Of his condition and the dream came true.

His clothes slept on him as if they were his lover."
1278,Lithium Dreams (White Sea),Amy Beeder,"The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia holds the world’s largest lithium reserves. “As remote and unlikely a place as can be imagined for the world to seek its salvation.”—Matthew Power

Once, volcanoes walked & talked like humans. Married.
           Quarreled & gave birth. When the beautiful Tunupa’s 

husband ran away & took their only child she mourned:

              this sunken bed, a dry & ragged ice-white sea. Tears

reduction of her ditches’ spill. This new abyss to feed our traffic."
1279,Lost to View,Stephen Edgar,"A range of clouds banked up behind the peak
Of that apocryphal
Blue mountain, with a wide, oblique
Burst of late sun
Projecting at the east’s receding wall

A film of what the day so far has done:
A wind that tries to scrape
The breaking waves up as they run
Across the bay
And shatter at the foot of Fluted Cape

In tern and gannet-printed veils of spray;
And trees the wind has caught,
Which seem too self-contained to sway
When they are blown,
And only move as a pleasing afterthought.

No one. No human presence has been known,
Surely, to venture here.
It takes one blackbird to disown
That vagary
And, whistling just a few feet from his ear,

To call him back again and make him be
The subject in this scene,
The one who is required to see.
Another day,
No blackbird with its song will intervene.

The spray will hang its veils and the trees sway."
1280,Martial 1.101,David Ferry,"He, who had been the one to whom I had
Recited my poems and then he wrote them down
With his faithful scribal hand for which already
He was well known and had been justly praised,
Demetrius has died. He lived to be
Fifteen years old, and after that four summers.
Even the Caesars had heard how good he was.

When he fell sick and I knew he was going to die,
I didn’t want him to descend to where
The Stygian shades are, still a slave, and so
I relinquished my ownership of him to his sickness.
Deserving by my deed to have gotten well,
He knew what I had done and was grateful for it,
Calling me his patron, falling free,

Down to those waters that are waiting there."

1282,A Summer Garden,Louise Glück,"1
Several weeks ago I discovered a photograph of my mother
sitting in the sun, her face flushed as with achievement or triumph.
The sun was shining. The dogs
were sleeping at her feet where time was also sleeping,
calm and unmoving as in all photographs.

I wiped the dust from my mother’s face.
Indeed, dust covered everything; it seemed to me the persistent
haze of nostalgia that protects all relics of childhood.
In the background, an assortment of park furniture, trees and shrubbery.

The sun moved lower in the sky, the shadows lengthened and darkened.
The more dust I removed, the more these shadows grew.
Summer arrived. The children
leaned over the rose border, their shadows
merging with the shadows of the roses.

A word came into my head, referring
to this shifting and changing, these erasures
that were now obvious—

it appeared, and as quickly vanished.
Was it blindness or darkness, peril, confusion?

Summer arrived, then autumn. The leaves turning,
the children bright spots in a mash of bronze and sienna.

                                                         2

When I had recovered somewhat from these events,
I replaced the photograph as I had found it
between the pages of an ancient paperback,
many parts of which had been
annotated in the margins, sometimes in words but more often
in spirited questions and exclamations
meaning “I agree” or “I’m unsure, puzzled—”

The ink was faded. Here and there I couldn’t tell
what thoughts occurred to the reader
but through the bruise-like blotches I could sense
urgency, as though tears had fallen.

I held the book awhile.
It was Death in Venice (in translation);
I had noted the page in case, as Freud believed,
nothing is an accident.

Thus the little photograph
was buried again, as the past is buried in the future.
In the margin there were two words,
linked by an arrow: “sterility” and, down the page, “oblivion”—

“And it seemed to him the pale and lovely
summoner out there smiled at him and beckoned...”

                                                         3

How quiet the garden is;
no breeze ruffles the Cornelian cherry.
Summer has come.

How quiet it is
now that life has triumphed. The rough

pillars of the sycamores
support the immobile
shelves of the foliage,

the lawn beneath
lush, iridescent—

And in the middle of the sky,
the immodest god.

Things are, he says. They are, they do not change;
response does not change.

How hushed it is, the stage
as well as the audience; it seems
breathing is an intrusion.

He must be very close,
the grass is shadowless.

How quiet it is, how silent,
like an afternoon in Pompeii.

Beatrice took the children to the park in Cedarhurst.
The sun was shining. Airplanes
passed back and forth overhead, peaceful because the war was over.

It was the world of her imagination:
true and false were of no importance.

Freshly polished and glittering—
that was the world. Dust
had not yet erupted on the surface of things.

The planes passed back and forth, bound
for Rome and Paris—you couldn’t get there
unless you flew over the park. Everything
must pass through, nothing can stop—

The children held hands, leaning
to smell the roses.
They were five and seven.

Infinite, infinite—that
was her perception of time.

She sat on a bench, somewhat hidden by oak trees.
Far away, fear approached and departed;
from the train station came the sound it made.

The sky was pink and orange, older because the day was over.

There was no wind. The summer day
cast oak-shaped shadows on the green grass."

And the tricks of the Myrmidons. Throughout the city 
The Trojans, wearied by joy, lie fast asleep.
And now the Greeks set out from Tenedos, 
Their ships proceeding in an ordered line, 
Under the friendly light of the silent moon, 
Making their way toward the shore they know so well,
And when the royal galley’s beacon light 
Is lighted, Sinon sees it, and quietly goes,
Protected by malign complicit fates,
And furtively opens up the Horse’s flank
And frees the Argive warriors from its womb.
The Horse releases them to the open air
And joyfully they come out: first come the captains
Thessander, and Sthenelus, and dire Ulysses, 
Lowering themselves to the ground by means of a rope,
And Acamas and Thoas, and Pyrrhus, Achilles’ son,
And Machaon the prince, and Menelaus, 
And Epeus, he, who contrived the Wooden Horse 
That fooled us so. And then they enter the city,
That’s deep submerged in wine and unknowing sleep;
They surprise and kill the watch, and open the gates
To welcome in their comrades from the fleet,
Letting them in for what they are going to do."
1284,The Art of Being,Anne Coray,"The fern in the rain breathes the silver message.
Stay, lie low. Play your dark reeds
and relearn the beauty of absorption.
There is nothing beyond the rotten log
 covered with leaves and needles.
Forget the light emerging with its golden wick.
Raise your face to the water-laden frond.
A thousand blossoms will fall into your arms."
1285,"Sometimes, When the Light",Lisel Mueller,"Sometimes, when the light strikes at odd angles
and pulls you back into childhood
 
 and you are passing a crumbling mansion
completely hidden behind old willows
 
 or an empty convent guarded by hemlocks
and giant firs standing hip to hip,
 
 you know again that behind that wall,
under the uncut hair of the willows
 
 something secret is going on,
so marvelous and dangerous
 
 that if you crawled through and saw,
you would die, or be happy forever."
1286,Mine - by the Right of the White Election! (411),Emily Dickinson,"Mine - by the Right of the White Election!
Mine - by the Royal Seal!
Mine - by the sign in the Scarlet prison - 
Bars - cannot conceal!

Mine - here - in Vision - and in Veto!
Mine - by the Grave's Repeal - 
Titled - Confirmed - 
Delirious Charter! 
Mine - long as Ages steal!"
1287,After Disappointment,Mark Jarman,"To lie in your child’s bed when she is gone
Is calming as anything I know. To fall
Asleep, her books arranged above your head,
Is to admit that you have never been
So tired, so enchanted by the spell
Of your grown body. To feel small instead
Of blocking out the light, to feel alone,
Not knowing what you should or shouldn’t feel,
Is to find out, no matter what you’ve said
About the cramped escapes and obstacles
You plan and face and have to call the world,
That there remain these places, occupied
By children, yours if lucky, like the girl
Who finds you here and lies down by your side."
1288,Off A Side Road Near Staunton,Stanley Plumly,"Some nothing afternoon, no one anywhere,
an early autumn stillness in the air,
the kind of empty day you fill by taking in
the full size of the valley and its layers leading
slowly to the Blue Ridge, the quality of country,
if you stand here long enough, you could stay
for, step into, the way a landscape, even on a wall,
pulls you in, one field at a time, pasture and fall
meadow, high above the harvest, perfect
to the tree line, then spirit clouds and intermittent
sunlit smoky rain riding the tops of the mountains,
though you could walk until it’s dark and not reach those rains—
you could walk the rest of the day into the picture
and not know why, at any given moment, you’re there."
1289,How She Bowed to her Brother,Gertrude Stein,"The story of how she bowed to her brother.
Who has whom as his.
 Did she bow to her brother. When she saw him.
 Any long story. Of how she bowed to her brother.
 Sometimes not.
 She bowed to her brother. Accidentally. When she saw him.
 Often as well. As not.
 She did not. Bow to her brother. When she. Saw him.
 This could happen. Without. Him.
 Everybody finds in it a sentence that pleases them.
 This is the story included in. How she bowed to her brother.
 Could another brother have a grand daughter.
 No. But. He could have a grandson.
 This has nothing to do with the other brother of whom it is said that we read she bowed to her brother.
 There could be a union between reading and learning.
 And now everybody. Reads. She bowed. To her brother.
 And no one. Thinks.
 Thinks that it is clearly. Startling.
 She started. By not bowing. To her brother.
 And this was not the beginning.
 She has forgotten.
 How she bowed. To her brother.
 And. In mentioning. She did mention. That this was. A recollection.
 For fortunately. In detail. Details were given.
 Made an expression. Of recollection.
 Does whether. They gather. That they heard. Whether. They bowed. To each other. Or not.
 If in. They made it. Doubtful. Or double. Of their holding it. A momentary after. That she was never. Readily made rather. That they were. Whether. She asked her. Was she doing anything. Either.
 In all this there lay. No description. And so. Whether. They could come to be nearly. More. Than more. Or rather. Did she. Bow to her brother.
 
  
 PART II
 They were a few. And they knew. Not that. She had bowed. To her brother. There were
 not. A few. Who knew. That she. Had. Bowed to her brother. Because if they knew.
 They would say. That a few. Knew. That she. Had bowed to her brother. But
 necessarily. Not a few. Knew. They did. Not know. Because they. Were not there. There
 are not a few. Who are there. Because. Nobody. Was there. Nor did. She know. That
 she was there. To help to share. And they can. Be there. To tell. Them. So. That. They
 know. She bowed. To her brother. More. There. Than. There.

 Which. She easily pointed out. Which. She bowed to her brother. And. Which.
 If she had been likely to restate that doors which relate an advantage to their advancing. And not at all. As a coincidence.
 She bowed to her brother. This was a chance. That might have happened. Minutely.
 To interrupt a white dog. Who can occasionally.
 In instance
 No once counts alike
 She bowed to her brother. For. And. Counts alike.
 She bowed. To her brother. Could be lost. By their leaving. It as lost. By. The time. In which. They feel. They will. It is. Indebted. That able. Presence. As very much. And idle. If she were walking along. She would be. She would not. Bow to her brother. If she were  riding. Along. She would. Be. She would. Be. Not as bowing. To her. Brother.
 As she rode along. Easily. By driving. As she rode. Along. She. Bowed. To her brother.
 It is. True. As. She drove. Along. She. Bowed. To her brother.
 Just like that.
 She bowed. To her brother.
 They were. There. That is to say. They were. Passing there. They were passing there. But not. On that day. And with this. To say. It was said. She bowed. To her brother. Which was. A fact.
 If she bowed. To her brother. Which was. A fact. That is. If she bowed. Which. If she bowed. Which she did. She bowed to her brother.
 Which she did. She bowed to her brother. Or rather. Which she did. She bowed to her brother. Or rather which she did she bowed to her brother.
 She could think. Of how she was. Not better. Than when. They could say. Not. How do you do. To-day. Because. It is an accident. In suddenness. When there is. No stress. On their. Address. They do not address you. By saying. Rather. That they went by. And came again. Not. As. Or. Why.
 It is. What is. Even. Not always occurred. Just by the time. That it. Can happen. To be curious. She bowed. To her brother. And why. Again. In there. Should have been. Not more. Than. That. Which. She bowed. To her brother.
 By which. It is. In tendency. To more. By which. It is. In tendency to not. Have had. She in the. Three. She bowed. To her brother.
 Would it be. In a way. Not they. Would. Not. They. Be in a way that is. To say. She. Is to say. Did. She bow. To her brother. In. Which way. Did. She come to say. It was. That way.
 She bowed to her brother.
 If it was. Separately. Not. To separate. Separately. No one. Is there. But there. Was it. With them. As perhaps. Portions. For there. Which. In which. She bowed to her brother.
 Not. After. In intention. The same. As mention. She did not mention. Nor was there. Intention. That she. Bowed to her brother.

        I knew to them.

        If they tear a hunter through, if they tear through a hunter, if they tear through a hunt and a hunter, if they tear through different sizes of the six, the different sizes of the six which are these, a woman with a white package under one arm and a black package under the other arm and dressed in brown with a white blouse, the second Saint Joseph the third a hunter in a blue coat and black garters and a plaid cap, a fourth a knife grinder who is full faced and a very little woman with black hair and a yellow hat and an excellently smiling appropriate soldier.

        Why do you feel differently about a medium sized turkey and a very large one.

        Why do you feel differently about a small band of sheep and several sheep that are riding.

        Why do you feel differently about a fair orange tree and one that has blossoms as well.

KNEELING

        One two three four five six seven eight nine and ten.

        The tenth is a little one kneeling and giving away a rooster with this feeling.

        I have mentioned one, four five seven eight and nine.

        Two is also giving away an animal.

        Three is changed as to disposition.

        Six is in question if we mean mother and daughter, black and black caught her, and she offers to be three she offers it to me.

        That is very right and should come out below and just so.
 

BUNDLES FOR THEM.

A HISTORY OF GIVING BUNDLES.

        We are able to notice that each one in a way carried a bundle, they were not a trouble to them nor were they all bundles as some of them were chickens some of them pheasants some of them sheep and some of them bundles, they were not a trouble to them and then indeed we learned that it was the principal recreation and they were so arranged that they were not given away, and to-day they were given away.

        I will not look at them again.

        They will not look for them again.

        They have not seen them here again.

        They are in there and we hear them again.

        In which way are stars brighter than they are. When we have come to this decision. We mention many thousands of buds. And when I close my eyes I see them.
 

        If you hear her snore

        It is not before you love her

        You love her so that to be her beau is very lovely

        She is sweetly there and her curly hair is very lovely

        She is sweetly here and I am very near and that is very lovely.

        She is my tender sweet and her little feet are stretched out well which is a treat and very lovely

        Her little tender nose is between her little eyes which close and are very lovely.

        She is very lovely and mine which is very lovely.
 

ON HER WAY.

        If you can see why she feel that she kneels if you can see why he knows that he shows what he bestows, if you can see why they share what they share, need we question that there is no doubt that by this time if they had intended to come they would have sent some notice of such intention. She and they and indeed the decision itself is not early dissatisfaction.
 

IN THIS WAY.

        Keys please, it is useless to alarm any one it is useless to alarm some one it is useless to be alarming and to get fertility in gardens in salads in heliotrope and in dishes. Dishes and wishes are mentioned and dishes and wishes are not capable of darkness. We like sheep. And so does he.
 

                                                                  LET US DESCRIBE.
         Let us describe how they went. It was a very windy night and the road although in excellent condition and extremely well graded has many turnings and although the curves are not sharp the rise is considerable. It was a very windy night and some of the larger vehicles found it more prudent not to venture. In consequence some of those who had planned to go were unable to do so. Many others did go and there was a sacrifice, of what shall we, a sheep, a hen, a cock, a village, a ruin, and all that and then that having been blessed let us bless it."

1292,Matisse,Gertrude Stein,"One was quite certain that for a long part of his being one being living he had been trying to be certain that he was wrong in doing what he was doing and then when he could not come to be certain that he had been wrong in doing what he had been doing, when he had completely convinced himself that he would not come to be certain that he had been wrong in doing what he had been doing he was really certain then that he was a great one and he certainly was a great one. Certainly every one could be certain of this thing that this one is a great one.

   Some said of him, when anybody believed in him they did not then believe in any other one. Certainly some said this of him.

   He certainly very clearly expressed something. Some said that he did not clearly express anything. Some were certain that he expressed something very clearly and some of such of them said that he would have been a greater one if he had not been one so clearly expressing what he was expressing. Some said he was not clearly expressing what he was expressing and some of such of them said that the greatness of struggling which was not clear expression made of him one being a completely great one.

   Some said of him that he was greatly expressing something struggling. Some said of him that he was not greatly expressing something struggling.

   He certainly was clearly expressing something, certainly sometime any one might come to know that of him. Very many did come to know it of him that he was clearly expressing what he was expressing. He was a great one. Any one might come to know that of him. Very many did some to know that of him. Some who came to know that of him, that he was a great one, that he was clearly expressing something, came then to be certain that he was not greatly expressing something being struggling. Certainly he was expressing something being struggling. Any one could be certain that he was expressing something being struggling. Some were certain that he was greatly expressing this thing. Some were certain that he was not greatly expressing this thing. Every one could come to be certain that he was a great man. Any one could come to be certain that he was clearly expressing something.

   Some certainly were wanting to be needing to be doing what he was doing, that is clearly expressing something. Certainly they were willing to be wanting to be a great one. They were, that is some of them, were not wanting to be needing expressing anything being struggling. And certainly he was one not greatly expressing something being struggling, he was a great one, he was clearly expressing something. Some were wanting to be doing what he was doing that is clearly expressing something. Very many were doing what he was doing, not greatly expressing something being struggling. Very many were wanting to be doing what he was doing were not wanting to be expressing anything being struggling.

   There were very many wanting to be doing what he was doing that is to be one clearly expressing something. He was certainly a great man, any one could be really certain of this thing, every one could be certain of this thing. There were very many who were wanting to be ones doing what he was doing that is to be ones clearly expressing something and then very many of them were not wanting to be being ones doing that thing, that is clearly expressing something, they wanted to be ones expressing something being struggling, something being going to be some other thing, something being going to be something some one sometime would be clearly expressing and that would be something that would be a thing then that would then be greatly expressing some other thing than that thing, certainly very many were then not wanting to be doing what this one was doing clearly expressing something and some of them had been ones wanting to be doing that thing wanting to be ones clearly expressing something. Some were wanting to be ones doing what this one was doing wanted to be ones clearly expressing something. Some of such of them were ones certainly clearly expressing something, that was in them a thing not really interesting then any other one. Some of such of them went on being all their living ones wanting to be clearly expressing something and some of them were clearly expressing something.

   This one was one very many were knowing some and very many were glad to meet him, very many sometimes listened to him, some listened to him very often, there were some who listened to him, and he talked then and he told them then that certainly he had been one suffering and he was then being one trying to be certain that he was wrong in doing what he was doing and he had come then to be certain that he never would be certain that he was doing what it was wrong for him to be doing then and he was suffering then and he was certain that he would be one doing what he was doing and he was certain that he should be one doing what he was doing and he was certain that he would always be one suffering and this then made him certain this, that he would always be one being suffering, this made him certain that he was expressing something being struggling and certainly very many were quite certain that he was greatly expressing something being struggling. This one was one knowing some who were listening to him and he was telling very often about being one suffering and this was not a dreary thing to any one hearing that then, it was not a saddening thing to any one hearing it again and again, to some it was quite an interesting thing hearing it again and again, to some it was an exciting thing hearing it again and again, some knowing this one and being certain that this one was a great man and was one clearly expressing something were ones hearing this one telling about being one being living were hearing this one telling this thing again and again. Some who were ones knowing this one and were ones certain that this one was one who was clearly telling something, was a great man, were not listening very often to this one telling again and again about being one being living. Certainly some who were certain that this one was a great man and one clearly expressing something and greatly expressing something being struggling were listening to this one telling about being living telling about this again and again and again. Certainly very many knowing this one and being certain that this one was a great man and that this one was clearly telling something were not listening to this one telling about being living, were not listening to this one telling this again and again.

   This one was certainly a great man, this one was certainly clearly expressing something. Some were certain that this one was clearly expressing something being struggling, some were certain that this one was not greatly expressing something being struggling.

   Very many were not listening again and again to this one telling about being one being living.  Some were listening again and again to this one telling about this one being one being in living.

   Some were certainly wanting to be doing what this one was doing that is were wanting to be ones clearly expressing something. Some of such of them did not go on in being ones wanting to be doing what this one was doing that is in being ones clearly expressing something.

1293,Shepherd Road,Ashley Anna McHugh,"Eventually, I grab the back-door key
from the cup-holder, slip a folded list
into my pocket. Inside, I dig through closets

to find the lincoln logs, the cardinal statue,
the clock shaped like an elephant, a kettle—

but the whole time I half expect to hear her:
the careful shuffle of her slow, flat feet;
her walker's unpredictable clap; her voice

trembling with evangelical vibrato.
Beside the bed, I find a King James Bible,

her careful marginalia penciled in:
 Glory! Glory! Amen! I set it down.
I shouldn't want it just because it's hers."
1294,"An Order Prescribed, by Is. W., to two of her Younger Sisters Serving in London",Isabella Whitney,"Good sisters mine, when I
        shall further from you dwell,
Peruse these lines, observe the rules
        which in the same I tell.
So shall you wealth possess,
        and quietness of mind:
And all your friends to see the same,
        a treble joy shall find.

In mornings when you rise,
        forget not to commend
Your selves to God, beseeching him
        from dangers to defend
Your souls and bodies both,
        your parents and your friends,
Your teachers and your governers.
        So pray you that your ends
May be in such a sort
        as God may pleasèd be:
To live to die, to die to live,
        with him eternally.

Then justly do such deeds
        as are to you assigned:
All wanton toys, good sisters now,
        exile out of your mind.
I hope you give no cause
        whereby I should suspect,
But this I know, too many live
        that would you soon infect.
If God do not prevent,
        or with his grace expell,
I cannot speak, or write too much,
        because I love you well.

Your business soon dispatch
        and listen to no lies,
Nor credit every fained tale,
        that many will devise.
For words they are but wind,
        yet words may hurt you so,
As you shall never brook the same,
        if that you have a foe.
God shield you from all such
        as would by word or bill
Procure your shame, or never cease
        till they have wrought you ill.

See that you secrets seal,
        tread trifles under ground:
If to rehearsal oft you come,
        it will your quiet wound.
Of laughter be not much,
        nor over solemn seem,
For then be sure they'll compt you light
        or proud will you exteem.
Be modest in a mean,
        be gentle unto all:
Though cause they give of contrary
        yet be to wrath no thrall.
Refer you all to him,
        that sits above the skies:
Vengeance is his, he will revenge,
        you need it not devise.

And sith that virtue guides,
        where both of you do dwell:
Give thanks to God, and painful be
        to please your rulers well.
For fleeting is a foe,
        experience hath me taught:
The rolling stone doth get no moss
        your selves have heard full oft.
Your business being done,
        and this my scroll perused,
The day will end, and that the night
        by you be not abused.
I something needs must write:
        take pains to read the same.
Henceforth my life as well as pen
        shall your examples frame.

Your Masters gone to bed,
        your Mistresses at rest,
Their daughters all with haste about
        to get themselves undrest.
See that their plate be safe,
        and that no spoon do lack,
See doors and windows bolted fast
        for fear of any wrack.
Then help if need there be,
        to do some household thing:
If not, to bed, referring you
        unto the heavenly King.
Forgetting not to pray
        as I before you taught,
And giving thanks for all that he
        hath ever for you wrought.
Good Sisters, when you pray,
        let me remembered be:
So will I you, and thus I cease,
        till I your selves do see."
1295,"A Sweet Nosegay, or Pleasant Poesy, Containing a Hundred and Ten Philosophical Flowers",Isabella Whitney,"Those strokes which mates in mirth do give
        do seem to be but light,
Although sometime they leave a sign
        seems grievous to the sight.

He that is void of any friend,
        him company to keep,
Walks in a world of wilderness,
        full fraught with dangers deep.

Each lover knoweth what he likes
        and what he doth desire,
But seld, or never, doth he know
        what thing he should require.

Affection fond deceives the wise
        and love makes men such noddies
That to their selves they seem as dead
        yet live in other bodies.

Ask nothing of thy neighbour that
        thou wouldst not let him have:
Nor say him nay of that which thou
        wouldst get if thou didst crave.

Two eyes, two ears, and but one tongue
        Dame Nature hath us framed
That we might see and hear much more
        than should with tongue be named.

Seek not each man to please, for that
        is more than God bids do:
Please thou the best, and neuer care,
        what wicked say thereto."
1296,To her Sister Mistress A. B.,Isabella Whitney,"Because I to my brethern wrote
        and to my sisters two:
Good sister Anne, you this might wote,
        if so I should not do
To you, or ere I parted hence,
You vainly had bestowed expence.

Yet is it not for that I write,
        for nature did you bind
To do me good, and to requite
        hath nature me inclined:
Wherefore good sister take in gree
These simple lines that come from me.

Wherein I wish you Nestor's days,
        in happy health to rest:
With such success in all assays
        as those which God hath blest:
Your husband with your pretty boys,
God keep them free from all annoys.

And grant if that my luck it be
        to linger here so long
Till they be men, that I may see
        for learning them so strong
That they may march amongst the best
Of them which learning have possest.

By that time will my aged years
        perhaps a staff require:
And quakingly as still in fears
        my limbs draw to the fire:
Yet joy I shall them so to see,
If any joy in age there be.

Good sister so I you commend
        to him that made us all:
I know you huswifery intend,
        though I to writing fall:
Wherefore no lenger shall you stay
From business that profit may.

Had I a husband, or a house,
        and all that longs thereto,
My self could frame about to rouse,
        as other women do:
But till some household cares me tie,
My books and pen I will apply."
1297,Will and Testament,Isabella Whitney,"The time is come I must departe
        from thee, ah, famous Citie:
I never yet, to rue my smart,
        did finde that thou hadst pitie,
Wherefore small cause ther is, that I
        should greeve from thee to go:
But many Women foolyshly,
        lyke me, and other moe.
Doe such a fyxed fancy set,
        on those which least desarve,
That long it is ere wit we get,
        away from them to swarve,
But tyme with pittie oft wyl tel
        to those that wil her try:
Whether it best be more to mell,
        or vtterly defye.
And now hath time me put in mind,
        of thy great cruelnes:
That never once a help wold finde,
        to ease me in distres.
Thou never yet woldst credit geve
        to boord me for a yeare:
Nor with Apparell me releve
        except thou payed weare.
No, no, thou never didst me good,
        nor ever wilt, I know:
Yet am I in no angry moode,
        but wyll, or ere I goe,
In perfect love and charytie
        my Testament here write:
And leave to thee such Treasurye,
        as I in it recyte.
Now stand a side and geve me leave
        to write my latest Wyll:
And see that none you do deceave,
        of that I leave them tyl.

I whole in body, and in minde,
        but very weake in Purse:
Doo make, and write my Testament
        for feare it wyll be wurse.
And fyrst I wholy doo commend,
        my Soule and Body eke:
To God the Father and the Son,
        so long as I can speake.
And after speach: my Soule to hym,
        and Body to the Grave:
Tyll time that all shall rise agayne,
        their Judgement for to have.
And then I hope they both shal meete.
        to dwell for aye in ioye:
Whereas I trust to see my Friends
        releast, from all annoy.
Thus have you heard touching my soule,
        and body what I meane:
I trust you all wyll witnes beare,
        I have a stedfast brayne.

And now let mee dispose such things,
        as I shal leave behinde:
That those which shall receave the same,
        may know my wylling minde.
I firste of all to London leave
        because I there was bred:
Braue buildyngs rare, of Churches store,
        and Pauls to the head.
Betweene the same: fayre streats there bee,
        and people goodly store:
Because their keeping craveth cost,
        I yet wil leave him more.
First for their foode, I Butchers leave,
        that every day shall kyll:
By Thames you shal have Brewers store,
        and Bakers at your wyll.
And such as orders doo obserue,
        and eat fish thrice a weeke:
I leave two Streets, full fraught therwith,
        they neede not farre to seeke.
Watlyng Streete, and Canwyck streete,
        I full of Wollen leave:
And Linnen store in Friday streete,
        if they mee not deceave.
And those which are of callyng such,
        that costlier they require:
I Mercers leave, with silke so rich,
        as any would desyre.
In Cheape of them, they store shal finde
        and likewise in that streete:
I Goldsmithes leave, with Iuels such,
        as are for Ladies meete.
And Plate to furnysh Cubbards with,
        full braue there shall you finde:
With Purle of Siluer and of Golde,
        to satisfye your minde.
With Hoods, Bungraces, Hats or Caps,
        such store are in that streete:
As if on ton side you should misse
        the tother serues you feete.
For Nets of every kynd of sort,
        I leave within the pawne:
French Ruffes, high Purles, Gorgets and Sleeves
        of any kind of Lawne.
For Purse or Kniues, for Combe or Glasse,
        or any needeful knacke
I by the Stoks have left a Boy,
        wil aske you what you lack.
I Hose doo leave in Birchin Lane,
        of any kynd of syse:
For Women stitchte, for men both Trunks
        and those of Gascoyne gise.
Bootes, Shoes or Pantables good store,
        Saint Martins hath for you:
In Cornwall, there I leave you Beds,
        and all that longs thereto.
For Women shall you Taylors have,
        by Bow, the chiefest dwel:
In every Lane you some shall finde,
        can doo indifferent well.
And for the men, few Streetes or Lanes,
        but Bodymakers bee:
And such as make the sweeping Cloakes,
        with Gardes beneth the Knee.
Artyllery at Temple Bar,
        and Dagges at Tower hyll:
Swords and Bucklers of the best,
        are nye the Fleete vntyll.
Now when thy Folke are fed and clad
        with such as I have namde:
For daynty mouthes, and stomacks weake
        some Iunckets must be framde.
Wherfore I Poticaries leave,
        with Banquets in their Shop:
Phisicians also for the sicke,
        Diseases for to stop.
Some Roysters styll, must bide in thee,
        and such as cut it out:
That with the guiltlesse quarel wyl,
        to let their blood about.
For them I cunning Surgions leave,
        some Playsters to apply.
That Ruffians may not styll be hangde,
        nor quiet persons dye.
For Salt, Otemeale, Candles, Sope,
        or what you els doo want:
In many places, Shops are full,
        I left you nothing scant.
Yf they that keepe what I you leave,
        aske Mony: when they sell it:
At Mint, there is such store, it is
        vnpossible to tell it.
At Stiliarde store of Wines there bee,
        your dulled mindes to glad:
And handsome men, that must not wed
        except they leave their trade.
They oft shal seeke for proper Gyrles,
        and some perhaps shall fynde:
(That neede compels, or lucre lures
        to satisfye their mind.)
And neare the same, I houses leave,
        for people to repayre:
To bathe themselues, so to preuent
        infection of the ayre.
On Saturdayes I wish that those,
        which all the weeke doo drug:
Shall thyther trudge, to trim them vp
        on Sondayes to looke smug.
Yf any other thing be lackt
        in thee, I wysh them looke:
For there it is: I little brought
        but nothyng from thee tooke.
Now for the people in thee left,
        I have done as I may:
And that the poore, when I am gone,
        have cause for me to pray.
I wyll to prisons portions leave,
        what though but very small:
Yet that they may remember me,
        occasion be it shall:
And fyrst the Counter they shal have,
        least they should go to wrack:
Some Coggers, and some honest men,
        that Sergantes draw a back.
And such as Friends wyl not them bayle,
        whose coyne is very thin:
For them I leave a certayne hole,
        and little ease within.
The Newgate once a Monthe shal have
        a sessions for his share:
Least being heapt, Infection might
        procure a further care.
And at those sessions some shal skape,
        with burning nere the Thumb:
And afterward to beg their fees,
        tyll they have got the some.
And such whose deedes deserueth death,
        and twelue have found the same:
They shall be drawne vp Holborne hill,
        to come to further shame:
Well, yet to such I leave a Nag
        shal soone their sorowes cease:
For he shal either breake their necks
        or gallop from the preace.
The Fleete, not in their circuit is,
        yet if I geve him nought:
It might procure his curse, ere I
        unto the ground be brought.
Wherfore I leave some Papist olde
        to vnder prop his roofe:
And to the poore within the same,
        a Boxe for their behoofe.
What makes you standers by to smile.
        and laugh so in your sleeve:
I thinke it is, because that I
        to Ludgate nothing geve.
I am not now in case to lye,
        here is no place of iest:
I dyd reserve, that for my selfe,
        yf I my health possest.
And ever came in credit so
        a debtor for to bee.
When dayes of paiment did approch,
        I thither ment to flee.
To shroude my selfe amongst the rest,
        that chuse to dye in debt:
Rather then any Creditor,
        should money from them get.
Yet cause I feele my selfe so weake
        that none mee credit dare:
I heere reuoke: and doo it leave,
        some Banckrupts to his share.
To all the Bookebinders by Paulles
        because I lyke their Arte:
They e'ry weeke shal mony have,
        when they from Bookes departe.
Amongst them all, my Printer must,
        have somwhat to his share:
I wyll my Friends these Bookes to bye
        of him, with other ware.
For Maydens poore, I Widdoers ritch,
        do leave, that oft shall dote:
And by that meanes shal mary them,
        to set the Girles aflote.
And wealthy Widdowes wil I leave,
        to help yong Gentylmen:
Which when you have, in any case
        be courteous to them then:
And see their Plate and Iewells eake
        may not be mard with rust.
Nor let their Bags too long be full,
        for feare that they doo burst.
To e'ry Gate vnder the walles,
        that compas thee about:
I Fruit wives leave to entertayne
        such as come in and out.
To Smithfeelde I must something leave
        my Parents there did dwell:
So carelesse for to be of it,
        none wolde accompt it well.
Wherfore it thrice a weeke shall have,
        of Horse and neat good store,
And in his Spitle, blynd and lame,
        to dwell for evermore.
And Bedlem must not be forgot,
        for that was oft my walke:
I people there too many leave,
        that out of tune doo talke.
At Bridewel there shal Bedelles be,
        and Matrones that shal styll
See Chalke wel chopt, and spinning plyde,
        and turning of the Mill.
For such as cannot quiet bee,
        but striue for House or Land:
At Th' innes of Court, I Lawyers leave
        to take their cause in hand.
And also leave I at ech Inne
        of Court, or Chauncerye:
Of Gentylmen, a youthfull roote,
        full of Actiuytie:
For whom I store of Bookes have left,
        at each Bookebinders stall:
And parte of all that London hath
        to furnish them withall.
And when they are with study cloyd:
        to recreate theyr minde:
Of Tennis Courts, of dauncing Scooles,
        and fence they store shal finde.
And every Sonday at the least,
        I leave to make them sport.
In diuers places Players, that
        of wonders shall reporte.
Now London have I (for thy sake)
        within thee, and without:
As coms into my memory,
        dispearsed round about
Such needfull thinges, as they should have
        heere left now unto thee:
When I am gon, with consience,
        let them dispearced bee.
And though I nothing named have,
        to bury mee withall:
Consider that aboue the ground,
        annoyance bee I shall.
And let me have a shrowding Sheete
        to couer mee from shame:
And in obliuyon bury mee
        and never more mee name.
Ringings nor other Ceremonies,
        vse you not for cost:
Nor at my buriall, make no feast,
        your mony were but lost.
Reioyce in God that I am gon,
        out of this vale so vile.
And that of ech thing, left such store,
        as may your wants exile.
I make thee sole executor, because
        I lou'de thee best.
And thee I put in trust, to geve
        the goodes unto the rest.
Because thou shalt a helper neede,
        In this so great a chardge,
I wysh good Fortune, be thy guide, least
        thou shouldst run at lardge.
The happy dayes and quiet times,
        they both her Seruants bee.
Which well wyll serue to fetch and bring,
        such things as neede to thee.

Wherfore (good London) not refuse,
        for helper her to take:
Thus being weake and wery both
        an end heere wyll I make.
To all that aske what end I made,
        and how I went away:
Thou answer maist like those which heere,
        no longer tary may.
And unto all that wysh mee well,
        or rue that I am gon:
Doo me comend, and bid them cease
        my absence for to mone.
And tell them further, if they wolde,
        my presence styll have had:
They should have sought to mend my luck;
        which ever was too bad.
So fare thou well a thousand times,
        God sheelde thee from thy foe:
And styll make thee victorious,
        of those that seeke thy woe.
And (though I am perswade) that I
        shall never more thee see:
Yet to the last, I shal not cease
        to wish much good to thee.
This, xx. of October I,
        in ANNO DOMINI:
A Thousand: v. hundred seuenty three
        as Alminacks descry.
Did write this Wyll with mine owne hand
        and it to London gaue:
In witnes of the standers by,
        whose names yf you wyll have.
Paper, Pen and Standish were:
        at that same present by:
With Time, who promised to reveale,
        so fast as she could hye
The same: least of my nearer kyn,
        for any thing should vary:
So finally I make an end
        no longer can I tary."
1298,"Almost Nowhere in the World, as Far as Anyone Can Tell",Dick Allen,"It is pleasant, very pleasant, to sit at a wooden booth
surrounded by parrots, wheels, right-turning conch shells,
the victory banner and the endless knot,
the lotus, the treasure vase, the golden fishes—
is this not so? Is it not pleasant
to sip Tsingtao beer, or Zhujiang, or Yanjing,
and tap your fingers on the bamboo mats?
After we’ve drunk enough, there will be Buddhist Delight,
Mongolian beef side dishes, a whole host of sauces,
even some pizza and chicken wings if children are present,
as well as the small ice-cream machine, lotus paste, pears,
smiles and bows all around. It is pleasant, is it not,
to linger outside the door that opens to the parking lot
of this small strip mall beside this secondary road
and look upon the scattered cars all come to rest here
like boats in China, floating on a quiet evening tide."
1299,The Boom and After the Boom,Alice Lyons,"The Shannon when it washes

The river surface offers
space to the song:
hammer taps of Latvians
and Poles nailing planks
of a deck.        The place
between water and sky
holding sound. It is under-
loved and an amphitheater.

Latvians and Lithuanians
are nailing planks
of grooved decking.
It will be a nice feature
of that riverside property.
        Their tap-tapping

Winter gales have made swift work
of the billboard proclaiming
42 luxury bungalows only two
remaining.        Crumpled up

two-by-four legs akimbo—

1300,Calligraphy Accompanied by the Mood of a Calm but Definitive Sauce,Dick Allen,"Make your strokes thus: the horizontal:
as a cloud that slowly drifts across the horizon;
the vertical: as an ancient but strong vine stem;
the dot: a falling rock;
and learn to master the sheep leg, the tiger’s claw,
an apricot kernel, a dewdrop, the new moon,
the wave rising and falling. Do these
while holding your arm out above the paper
like the outstretched leg of a crane.
The strength of your hand
will give the stroke its bone.
But for real accomplishment, it would be well
if you would go to live solitary in a forest silence,
or beside a river flowing serenely.
It might also be useful
to look down a lonesome road,
and for the future
to stare into the gray static of a television screen,
or when lost in a video game
to accept you may never reach the final level,
where the dragon awaits, guarding the pot of gold,
and that you’ve left no footprints, not a single one,
despite all your adventures,
anyone following you could ever follow."
1301,The Cenotaph,Fanny Howe,"I want to leave this place
unremembered.
The gas stove is leaking
and the door of the refrigerator
stained with rust.
The mugs are ugly
and there are only two forks.
The walls are black
and soft, the bed a balloon
of night-clothing.
The stairwell sloped
to a dragger’s pace.

There are big windows
with blind-slats dusty
and gray. Street life 
goes all night and at dawn
freedmen shout and 
laugh outside the kitchen.

Where does life begin and end?
In the lamb or the cotton?
My pillow is my friend."

1303,Developers,Alice Lyons,"Greed got in the way. We built a fake estate.
Levinas said to see ourselves we need each other yet

doorbells, rows of them, glow in the night village
a string of lit invitations no elbow has leaned into

(both arms embracing messages). Unanswered
the doors are rotting from the bottom up.

It’s another perplexing pothole in our road, loves.
Hard core from the quarry might make it level,

hard core and cunning speculation into matters
concerning love and doubt, concerning want and plenty.

O the places where pavement runs out and ragwort
springs up, where Lindenwood ends but doesn’t abut

anywhere neatly, a petered-out plot of Tayto 
tumbleweeds, bin bags, rebar, roof slates, offcuts,

guttering, drain grilles, doodads, infill, gravel!
A not-as-yet nice establishment, possessing potential

where we have no authorized voice but are oddly fitted
out for the pain it takes to build bit by bit.

When the last contractions brought us to the brink
of our new predicament, we became developers."
1304,Everything,Fanny Howe,"Infinite nesting

towards emptiness:
child-nodes,

with a root element of null.
None is always included

Yet a fresh light was shed
on immortality
for me climbing the stairs

Everything was in the banister:

1305,Flatirons,David Yezzi,"I
From the false summit, coxcomb-cum-arête,
cool thermals underscore our frailties,
past edges where our wingless feet are set 
and the long look down dilutes the evergreens.
As sandstone ends, the world of ghosts begins—
they sometimes rise up still in dreams, my love.
With one hand firm, I step onto the skin
of the abyss, embracing what’s above
and severing spent ties to the scree below. 
The filtered light turns lichen eerie green,
ushering in a world we hardly know,
at least not one we’re sure we’ve ever seen
just so, each climber brand new in his skin,
no longer mired in waiting to begin.

                                           ii

The whisper clings beside you as you rise
along the ice melt, following the chalk.
Its cadence is the thrum behind your eyes;
your trembling, the music of its talk.
No longer trust your arms; they’re paid with fear.
Along the rock, the grip that’s hidden there,
invisible but sure, will not appear
until you trade your fast-hold for the air,
and, as you reach, it ripples like a pool
in which your newfound safety now reflects:
the diastole of breath becomes the rule
for governing what atmosphere elects—
to claim this height as owed to us in spirit,
although we risk ourselves to answer it.

                                           iii

Free solo: dearest, I am losing you,
not now (one hopes!) but slowly, over time.
Admit that there is nothing left to do
but re-devote our efforts to the climb,
remembering that the second side is less
than a reprieve—more sheer and far from kind—
before the gentle, sloping wilderness
enwraps us and we let go of the sky.
Your living hand guides home my dangled foot.
At gravity’s unlikely slant, we smear
across the arkose, knowing that the root
has taken hold deep in the layers. Here,
a thrust fault pushed up rock, and, as it rose,
it found its altitude in its repose.

                                           iv

Pinned to the face, you close the aperture—
no way looks right, and there is no way down
but keeping on—returning’s hot allure
hissing its false promises, the sound
of the last support beam loudly giving way.
What is it that wipes the rock free of direction?
The crystal ceiling that began the day
goes black, almost it seems without detection.
The open door blows shut; the empty glass
brims over and, when raised, is dry again:
time’s bait-and-switch. An hour from the pass,
wind drags high clouds across the peak; just then 
the air grows cold. Our backs turn to the weather,
as a way comes clear, ascending with no tether.

                                           v

It’s when we’re most engaged with other things
that the angel enters, a twist in temperature,
a lightness in the chest that we call wings. 
Giddy with sacrament and the impure
gluttony of blood and air and skin,
we look with panoramic eyes to where
the earth curls under and the sky begins,
though we ourselves are of this light-shot air,
senses extending without obstacle,
reaching past by rooting down through rock—
obdurate kindness, heaven’s windowsill.
We are as useless as an open lock,
more insubstantial than a drinking song,
and marked by sandstone long after we’re gone."

Whose hands touched, first, the head
of the penis, the shaft?

And was it soft
                          or shale?  More rock
than clay.

And who pinched first
into their place the small cups 
at the base of the ass? 

                                        Who was it
got down there, on whose knees,
and blew—
                         and was that passion
or panic, the machine that drove
those exhalations?
                                        —and how
could we rate the power of that
breath—breeze or gale or a whisper
like the song the little boy sings
to the beetle, 
                         whose small legs moved in tune

moved, if they did move, when 
                                                       the dust settled.

In my mind everything’s become enormous.

But was it ever small like that, the first body?

Did it ever sit close to the ants and their piles
of dirt from which that body had come?
You were a small boy once, I suppose.

You were dirty from the start.  

You showed me how to use a cock ring,
and why. 
                         How, without ever paying 
for a room, to spend two weeks in any city.
How two men could fuck 
and continue to face each other
directly
             —took my body and showed me,
my back on a table, my knees by my head.  
Stretched me 
                         into seeing you were more than a dog.

You must be dead by now, though I don’t know
whose hands prepared you. 

                                                      Whose fingers
fingered, for the final time,
all that dark and kinky hair?

If the first body was made of dirt,
in order to plumb the hollow 
of that first throat, whose thumb 
first lodged inside the hinge
of that first mouth to force it open?

To make the tongue, so it could work,
who shoved inside that mouth
the shit of a hundred thousand worms?"
1308,Hija for Emerson’s Birthday,Stephen Yenser,"I’m honored to shake the hand of a brave Iraqi citizen who had his hand cut off by Saddam Hussein.     —President George W. Bush, Washington DC, May 25, 2004

“Just ask yourself,” we said back in those days,
“Is this world better off without Saddam Hussein?”
Now that’s a simple question. Just ask yourself.

It turned up starkly, undeniably
As that left hand inside the trench Marines were digging
At the prison turned “facility.” 

That was one day’s headlined excavation.
Meanwhile, the relics from the tell near Nasiriyah
Were looted from the National Museum.

Is our world better off without Saddam 
Hussein, who had cut off so many other hands?
Our own president had grateful thousands

On hand to honor him, give him a hand 
In DC on the birthday of the Sage of Concord.
In other words, though, is this world better off

Without those who have made it better off?
It’s a bit of a riddle, really, how to tell,
But each old hand among us has a hunch.

Is our world better off without Bobby E. Beasely?
Michael Yury Tarlavsky? Craig W. Cherry?
Yadir G. Reynoso? Joshua I. Bunch?

These soldiers’ names graced the obituary
Page that day in the LA Times. It’s archived. Check it.
But what can we tell from a name? Or measly

Obit? Ask yourself. —Well, more than a bit
Of obit is in the name Tobit, but just what
Tobit of Nineveh—praised for preparing

For righteous burial the Judahites 
Who fell in war against Assyria,
And blessed with a devoted son who saved him—

What Tobit could now have to do with us,
Not even our extravagant friend Emerson
—Though wait! Emer? Cuchulain’s perfect mate, 

Worked hand in hand with him, possessor of 
The six great gifts of womanhood, from needlework
Through chastity to sweet words and gentle speech?

—Perhaps not even Emerson could tell, 
Who lauded nature’s “rounds” and scorned the divisive “line,”
Its “bounds of good and ill,” and praised perverse

Returns (“Evil will bless, and ice will burn”),
And who would have turned 199
That day in the merry month of Jumada al-awwal

When Bush addressed that brave unnamed Baghdadi.
—Raymond J. Faulstich, Jr., Kane M. Funke.
—What names people have! Stephen I. Yenser!

What monikers, what handles for their children.
—Daniel Lee Galvan...Anyway, without them, mind you,
We’d still have that butcher Saddam Hussein.
—Wait! With them, you mean, we’d still have Saddam?
—Well, it can be perplexing when it’s put like that.
—Bemusing. Like the sound of one hand clapping.

—Or one hand washing itself. Is our world better
Off without Roberto Abad? —Abad, Roberto:
What kind of name is that, in any case? 

Middle Eastern? And where’s the middle initial?
To tell him from his father, of course. A typo? For Bad,
Roberto A.? “Good is a good doctor,

But Bad is sometimes better” (Emerson)?
Or W, where Emerson and Bush dovetail?
—It seems Roberto got his girlfriend pregnant

In spite of the “Campaign for Children and Families”
Between Iraqi tours in case he didn’t come back
From his second, which of course he didn’t,

Not for a second, even, to glimpse his son,
Whose name we are not told. Hussein, perhaps—or George.
Or Herbert. George Herbert! (Such embranglement!

“I was entangled in a world of strife”!)
Not that we always want “to know what we don’t know”
(Donald H. Rumsfeld). We’re better off, long run,

If the right hand doesn’t know just what
The left has done, right? This world war’s better, for sure,
And to make the war’s world better too,

Someone has to sacrifice. And ask
Yourself, just who would make the better sacrifice?
—Make: what exactly does that mean?
—The ones who wear elaborate tattoos
(Needlework patient, painful, eldritch, intricate,
Wayward as jazz played on the parlor boom box,

Raddled with fractals like our savaged delta),
Obscurely traceable to a secret Inca rite, 
Ink indelible as gang connections

That they could nonetheless obliterate
There by the Tigris, on Boulevard Abu Nawas
(Abu Nawas: the Holy Dissolute,

Master of the wine song and of satire,
First Arab poet to applaud Sayiddah Palm).
The idle hands who’d just have died at home

In drive-bys, done in by their neighbors? Druggies,
Who’d get as high as some pol’s daughter and go awol
(lol) at their first chance? The born

Again, who needn’t fear their death? The un-
reborn, spirits aborted by their own vile hands?
The Muslim Americans who had their doubts?

The ones who had no doubts? Just ask yourself. 
—Or: how many are we better off without?
Is this where quantity turns quality?

—The world might well be better off without 
Others better offed in the right course of things.
Without those looters, for instance, who vandalized

The earliest stringed instrument we’d had,
The Golden Bull’s Head Lyre of Ur (in Genesis,
The Ur of Abraham whose sacrifice
Of his son Isaac God’s hand itself prevented).
Without Hussein’s own sons, and theirs, their sons, we mean,
And then which other ones? The Sunnis? The Shias?

The Ba’athist Sunnis and extremist Shias?
Or the Kurds? Which ones? The large Kurds? The older, hairy 
Ones, whose lives were mostly lived?

Or the small Kurds, who had no lives or hair
To speak of? The cottage Kurds? The urban Kurds? The turbaned
Kurds—those darker ones? The whey-faced ones? 

The anti-American ones? The Jewish ones?
The anti-Ku-Klux-Klan-and-anti-nra ones? 
The ones who “hate our freedom”—and our baseball?

The atheists? And there are some among them,
Not fit to enter any god’s Green Zone, perforce
Denied the houris, halos, hemp, and harps.

Or the Yazidis? Yes, that would make some sense,
Since they refuse to wear the colors green and blue,
And since they are so primitive they think,

In the beginning, God made the world a pearl,
And since they are so ancient, weak, impure, muddling
As they do trace elements of Islam,

Christianity, and Mithraism with some
Oddball Sufism and stray Persian superstitions.
Are there Iraqi Buddhists? No, really:

Are there? If you can’t say, will they be missed?
—Well, shame on you, if that is not the old epist-
emological enigma wrapped
In a conundrum!—Or a condomrun, 
As Bush might say on an off day. Just ask yourself:
Is our world better off today? Without

David L. Potter? For whom, exactly? The Potters?
At least if the “remains” go off to Arlington?
To Arlington we’ll bring our “idle flowers,”

Then—though “Every aster in my hand
Goes home loaded with a thought,” to cadge from Emerson.
Loaded? And what do we mean by remains?

We used to mean: to continue to belong to.
It’s doubtful that that definition still remains.
Is our “left hand” an instance of remains? 

What about the Golden Lyre’s pillar, 
Neck, and scroll, stripped of their gold and lapis inlay?
What about its shattered shell and limestone?

And what to make of this morning’s “Missing Remains”?
And “Remains Missing”? Six years after Bush’s offhand
Remark, new headlines from old headstones spring: 

“Thousands of Graves Are Misidentified
Or Unmarked at National Cemetery”—the names 
Broken off like handles from their vessels— 

Where also mud-caked markers line the banks
Of a purling stream (unnamed) and lie deep in its bed.
“Were they used as riprap to prevent 

The stream’s erosion?” our good reporter asks.
“Were they engraved incorrectly, hence
Discarded?” Engraved. Incorrectly. Discarded.
Is Arlington our potter’s field today?
And if so, as Abu Nawas’s student asked, 
“Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?”

“How gladly with proper words the soldier dies,”
Stevens’s verse assures us. But on the other hand,
What are the proper words? Is that word proper?

And shouldn’t that have been “the soil’s erosion”?
Erosion. So how would Eros figure here? Just ask
Yourself. —Of course he wouldn’t! Be rational.

—And so we must mean Cupid. Cupidity 
Is one thing we’d associate with “the soil’s erosion.”
Or should that be “the oil’s erosion”? “The soul’s”?

Are we better off without our soldiers,
Not to mention their daughters, inconceivable,
Who might have married deep-rigged princes’ sons

(As the First Daughters—light sweet crude rare—must have 
Might have done)? Without the so-called martyrs’ sisters, 
Paradisical virgins, immaculately 

Pregnant with bombs beneath matte black abayas?
Bush’s brave Baghdadi’s daughter’s better off, we’re sure.
(And he was not a southpaw anyway.)

Or is it the rebellious, the disobedient,
Whose sisters’ brothers died on our side near Samarra, 
Without whom our world’s (mostly) better off?

It’s hard to tell, when they have veils. It’s hard
To tell, when phantom limbs report again tomorrow,
Just whom we’re better off without. Yet ask
Yourself: can we contemn “the vanity
Of false distinctions” in light of presidential Scripture?
“If thy right hand offend...”—We must cut Matthew

Off quick as RFK, alas, in order
To go now to commercial. We’re sorry. We’re in the hands
Of the commercial. We leave you with this question:

Would our world be better off without Iraq 
Itself? Or what about your simple self?
—A little better, you must mean, or worse? 

—And what about our own bull-headed liars,
As Emerson might say? And the Milky Way—
Better off without this blue-green pearl of Earth? 

Yet who could tell? And if no one could tell...
What can we mean by tell? Now that’s a simple question."
1309,In a Station of the Metro,Dan Beachy-Quick,"Peace fell on the dim lands a sort of abstraction
The metronome counted one petal after another
So the petals fell as or in some music
This song needs no breath just an apparition
With a mouth open and eyes and eyes
The wet smear of eyes beneath pink 
Petals in excess of the window frame’s bright 
Yellow square and yes spring gathers right now
The moisture from my breath up into clouds 
Whose downpour makes of the plum tree in blossom
A diminishing crowd for which the natural symbol
Refuses to exist a plain blue gem on a pin
Faces glowing within the stone like flowers 
Within the stone like flaws the mind turns inward
Turns inward its tangle of wet black boughs
A knot pulled tight so tight it ceases to be 

A knot yes I’ll say it a knot that becomes angelic
Another example everywhere seen of the angelic
Gears toothless and without cogs a sort of mist
That turns the other gear by drifting through it
As just now through my eye drifts that storm
Battered tree whose broken-petal pocked bark
Asks of me a question my mouth can’t speak 
Like a river that dives underground just there
There where the animals thirst the most
A desert fox say or say a toad or let’s speak more simply
About a plum which bursts through its own explosion
Into being and hangs there so ponderously
As if as if not concerned with innocence or
Gravity or other acute angles as they evaporate
Into this poem O no am I speaking again again about
dim lands these dim dim lands of of peace"

a tiny box.

like an amper-
sand. As you fastened it 
to your lapel, 
I thought again of 
that motel 
outside of Chicago. 
¿Te acuerdas?
I sat on the edge 
of a bench, 
untied my shoes. 
Face down, eyes shut, 
you breathed in
the aroma 
of sweat & allspice 
coming off 
the sheets. I tossed 
my ring—gold, 
inscribed—toward a pile 
of clothes. 
But the ring 
dropped in the small

& rattled like a coin 
in a beggar’s 
cup."
1316,To the Angelbeast,Eduardo C. Corral,"For Arthur Russell

All that glitters isn’t music.

Once, hidden in tall grass,
I tossed fistfuls of dirt into the air:
doe after doe of leaping.

You said it was nothing
but a trick of the light. Gold
curves. Gold scarves.

Am I not your animal?

You’d wait in the orchard for hours
to watch a deer
break from the shadows.

You said it was like lifting a cello
out of its black case."

And short the season, first rubythroat
in the fading lilacs, alyssum in bloom,

him underground. Wet feet, wet cuffs,
little flecks of buttercup on my sneaker toes,
bluets, violets crowding out the tufts
of rich new grass the horses nose
and nibble like sleepwalkers held fast—
brittle beauty—might this be the last?"

over the “one burst of creation,” his original design,
it is said he often sang like a tree frog
and danced on his old bare feet.

One day, he adds one hemp fiber stroke,

What patience he had,
like a cat who comes back season after season to a mole’s tunnel.

1320,The Friends of Heraclitus,Charles Simic,"Your friend has died, with whom
You roamed the streets,
At all hours, talking philosophy.
So, today you went alone,
Stopping often to change places
With your imaginary companion,
And argue back against yourself
On the subject of appearances:
The world we see in our heads
And the world we see daily,
So difficult to tell apart
When grief and sorrow bow us over. 

You two often got so carried away
You found yourselves in strange neighborhoods
Lost among unfriendly folk,
Having to ask for directions
While on the verge of a supreme insight,
Repeating your question
To an old woman or a child
Both of whom may have been deaf and dumb.

What was that fragment of Heraclitus
You were trying to remember
As you stepped on the butcher’s cat?
Meantime, you yourself were lost
Between someone’s new black shoe
Left on the sidewalk
And the sudden terror and exhilaration
At the sight of a girl
Dressed up for a night of dancing
Speeding by on roller skates."
1321,Mirrors at 4 a.m.,Charles Simic,"You must come to them sideways
In rooms webbed in shadow,
Sneak a view of their emptiness
Without them catching
A glimpse of you in return.
 
The secret is,
Even the empty bed is a burden to them,
A pretense.
They are more themselves keeping
The company of a blank wall,
The company of time and eternity
 
Which, begging your pardon,
Cast no image
As they admire themselves in the mirror,
While you stand to the side
Pulling a hanky out
To wipe your brow surreptitiously."
1322,The White Room,Charles Simic,"The obvious is difficult
To prove. Many prefer
The hidden. I did, too.
I listened to the trees.

They had a secret
Which they were about to
Make known to me,
And then didn’t.

Summer came. Each tree
On my street had its own
Scheherazade. My nights
Were a part of their wild

Storytelling. We were
Entering dark houses,
More and more dark houses
Hushed and abandoned.

There was someone with eyes closed
On the upper floors.
The thought of it, and the wonder,
Kept me sleepless.

The truth is bald and cold,
Said the woman
Who always wore white.
She didn’t leave her room much.

The sun pointed to one or two
Things that had survived
The long night intact,
The simplest things,

Difficult in their obviousness.
They made no noise.
It was the kind of day
People describe as “perfect.”

Gods disguising themselves
As black hairpins? A hand-mirror?
A comb with a tooth missing?
No! That wasn’t it.

Just things as they are,
Unblinking, lying mute
In that bright light,
And the trees waiting for the night."
1323,Believe This,Richard Levine,"All morning, doing the hard, root-wrestling
work of turning a yard from the wild
to a gardener’s will, I heard a bird singing
from a hidden, though not distant, perch;
a song of swift, syncopated syllables sounding
like, Can you believe this, believe this, believe?
Can you believe this, believe this, believe? 
And all morning, I did believe. All morning,
between break-even bouts with the unwanted,
I wanted to see that bird, and looked up so
I might later recognize it in a guide, and know
and call its name, but even more, I wanted
to join its church. For all morning, and many
a time in my life, I have wondered who, beyond
this plot I work, has called the order of being,
that givers of food are deemed lesser
than are the receivers. All morning,
muscling my will against that of the wild,
to claim a place in the bounty of earth,
seed, root, sun and rain, I offered my labor
as a kind of grace, and gave thanks even
for the aching in my body, which reached
beyond this work and this gift of struggle."
1324,Bless Their Hearts,Richard Newman,"At Steak ‘n Shake I learned that if you add
“Bless their hearts” after their names, you can say
whatever you want about them and it’s OK.
 My son, bless his heart, is an idiot, 
she said. He rents storage space for his kids’
toys—they’re only one and three years old! 
I said, my father, bless his heart, has turned
into a sentimental old fool. He gets
weepy when he hears my daughter’s greeting
on our voice mail. Before our Steakburgers came
someone else blessed her office mate’s heart,
then, as an afterthought, the jealous hearts
of the entire anthropology department.
We bestowed blessings on many a heart
that day. I even blessed my ex-wife’s heart.
Our waiter, bless his heart, would not be getting
much tip, for which, no doubt, he’d bless our hearts.
In a week it would be Thanksgiving,
and we would each sit with our respective
families, counting our blessings and blessing
the hearts of family members as only family
does best. Oh, bless us all, yes, bless us, please
bless us and bless our crummy little hearts."
1325,The Cricket in the Sump,Catherine Tufariello,"He falls abruptly silent when we fling
A basket down or bang the dryer shut,
But soon takes up again where he left off.
Swept by a rainstorm through a narrow trough
Clotted with cobwebs into Lord knows what
Impenetrable murk, he’s undeterred—
You’d think his dauntless solo was a chorus,
This rusty sump, a field or forest spring.
And there is something wondrous and absurd
About the way he does as he is bidden
By instinct, with his gift for staying hidden
While making sure unseen is plainly heard.
 
 All afternoon his tremolo ascends
Clear to the second story, where a girl
Who also has learned blithely to ignore us
Sings to herself behind her bedroom door.
Maybe she moves to her invented score
With a conductor’s flourish, or pretends
She’s a Spanish dancer, lost in stamp and whirl
And waving fan—notes floating, as she plays,
Through the open window where the willow sways
And shimmers, humming to another string.
There is no story where the story ends.
What does a singer live for but to sing?"
1326,The Darker Sooner,Catherine Wing,"Then came the darker sooner,
came the later lower.
We were no longer a sweeter-here
happily-ever-after. We were after ever.
We were farther and further.
More was the word we used for harder.
Lost was our standard-bearer.
Our gods were fallen faster,
and fallen larger.
The day was duller, duller
was disaster. Our charge was error.
Instead of leader we had louder,
instead of lover, never. And over this river
broke the winter’s black weather."
1327,Two Gates,Denise Low,"I look through glass and see a young woman
of twenty, washing dishes, and the window
turns into a painting. She is myself thirty years ago.
She holds the same blue bowls and brass teapot
I still own. I see her outline against lamplight;
she knows only her side of the pane. The porch
where I stand is empty. Sunlight fades. I hear
water run in the sink as she lowers her head,
blind to the future. She does not imagine I exist.
 
 I step forward for a better look and she dissolves
into lumber and paint. A gate I passed through
to the next life loses shape. Once more I stand
squared into the present, among maple trees
and scissor-tailed birds, in a garden, almost
a mother to that faint, distant woman."
1328,Fabrication of Ancestors,Alan Dugan,"For old Billy Dugan, shot in the ass in the Civil war, my father said.

The old wound in my ass
has opened up again, but I
am past the prodigies
of youth’s campaigns, and weep
where I used to laugh
in war’s red humors, half
in love with silly-assed pains
and half not feeling them.
I have to sit up with
an indoor unsittable itch
before I go down late
and weeping to the storm-
cellar on a dirty night
and go to bed with the worms.
So pull dirt up over me
and make a family joke
for Old Billy Blue Balls,
the oldest private in the world
with two ass-holes and no
place more to go to for a laugh
except the last one. Say:
The North won the Civil War
without much help from me
although I wear a proof
of the war’s obscenity."
1329,How We Heard the Name,Alan Dugan,"The river brought down
dead horses, dead men
and military debris,
indicative of war
or official acts upstream,
but it went by, it all
goes by, that is the thing
about the river. Then
a soldier on a log
went by. He seemed drunk
and we asked him Why
had he and this junk
come down to us so
from the past upstream.
“Friends,” he said, “the great
Battle of Granicus
has just been won
by all of the Greeks except
the Lacedaemonians and
myself: this is a joke
between me and a man
named Alexander, whom
all of you ba bas
will hear of as a god.”"
1330,Love Song: I and Thou,Alan Dugan,"Nothing is plumb, level, or square:
     the studs are bowed, the joists
are shaky by nature, no piece fits
     any other piece without a gap
or pinch, and bent nails
     dance all over the surfacing
like maggots. By Christ
     I am no carpenter. I built
the roof for myself, the walls
     for myself, the floors
for myself, and got
     hung up in it myself. I
danced with a purple thumb
     at this house-warming, drunk
with my prime whiskey: rage.
     Oh I spat rage’s nails
into the frame-up of my work:
     it held. It settled plumb,
level, solid, square and true
     for that great moment. Then
it screamed and went on through,
     skewing as wrong the other way.
God damned it. This is hell,
     but I planned it. I sawed it,
I nailed it, and I
     will live in it until it kills me.
I can nail my left palm
     to the left-hand crosspiece but
I can’t do everything myself.
     I need a hand to nail the right,
a help, a love, a you, a wife."
1331,Monologue of a Commercial Fisherman,Alan Dugan,"“If you work a body of water and a body of woman
you can take fish out of one and children out of the other
for the two kinds of survival. The fishing is good,
both kinds are adequate in pleasures and yield,
but the hard work and the miseries are killing;
it is a good life if life is good. If not, not.
You are out in the world and in in the world,
having it both ways: it is sportive and prevenient living
combined, although you have to think about the weathers
and the hard work and the miseries are what I said.
It runs on like water, quickly, under the boat,
then slowly like the sand dunes under the house.
You survive by yourself by the one fish for a while
and then by the other afterward when you run out.
You run out a hooky life baited with good times,
and whether the catch is caught or not is a question
for those who go fishing for men or among them for things.”"
1332,On Hurricane Jackson,Alan Dugan,"Now his nose’s bridge is broken, one eye
will not focus and the other is a stray;
trainers whisper in his mouth while one ear
listens to itself, clenched like a fist;
generally shadowboxing in a smoky room,
his mind hides like the aching boys
who lost a contest in the Panhellenic games
and had to take the back roads home,
but someone else, his perfect youth,
laureled in newsprint and dollar bills,
triumphs forever on the great white way
to the statistical Sparta of the champs."
1333,"Wall, Cave, and Pillar Statements, after Asôka",Alan Dugan,"In order to perfect all readers
the statements should be carved
on rock walls, on cave walls,
and on the side of pillars so
the charm of their instruction can
affect the mountain climbers near
the cliffs, the plainsmen near
the pillars, and the city people near
the caves they go to on vacations.
 
The statements should, and in a fair
script, spell out the right text and gloss
of the Philosopher’s jocular remark. Text:
“Honesty is the best policy.” Gloss:
“He means not ‘best’ but ‘policy,’
(this is the joke of it) whereas in fact
          Honesty is Honesty, Best
          is Best, and Policy is Policy,
          the three terms being not
          related, but here loosely allied.
What is more important is that ‘is’
is, but the rocklike truth of the text
resides in the ‘the’. The ‘the’ is The.
          By this means the amusing sage
          has raised or caused to be raised
          the triple standard in stone:
the single is too simple for life,
the double is mere degrading hypocrisy,
but the third combines the first two
in a possible way, and contributes
something unsayable of its own:
this is the pit, nut, seed, or stone
of the fruit when the fruit has been
digested:
          It is good to do good for the wrong
          reason, better to do good for the good
          reason, and best of all to do good
          good: i.e. when the doer and doee
          and whatever passes between them
          are beyond all words like ‘grace’
          or ‘anagogic insight,’ or definitions like
          ‘particular instance of a hoped-at-law,’
and which the rocks alone can convey.
This is the real reason for the rock walls,
the cave walls and pillars, and not the base
desires for permanence and display
that the teacher’s conceit suggests.”
 
          That is the end of the statements, but,
          in order to go on a way after the end
          so as to make up for having begun
          after the beginning, and thus to come around
          to it in order to include the whole thing,
add: “In some places the poignant slogan,
‘Morality is a bad joke like everything else,’
may be written or not, granted that space
exists for the vulgar remarks, the dates,
initials and hearts of lovers, and all
other graffiti of the prisoners of this world.”"
1334,Failure,A.E. Stallings,"You humble in. It's just as you remember: 
The sallow walls, formica counter top, 

The circular argument of time beneath 
Fluorescent flickering—doubt, faith, and doubt. 

She knows you've been to see the gilded girl 
Who's always promising and walking out 

With someone else. She knew that you'd return, 
With nothing in your pockets but your fists. 

Why do you resist? When will you learn 
That this is what your weary dreams are of— 

Succumbing to Her unconditional love?"
1335,Enter a Cloud,W. S. Graham,"1
 
Gently disintegrate me
Said nothing at all.
 
Is there still time to say
Said I myself lying
In a bower of bramble
Into which I have fallen.
 
Look through my eyes up
At blue with not anything
We could have ever arranged
Slowly taking place.
 
Above the spires of the fox
Gloves and above the bracken
Tops with their young heads
Recognising the wind,
The armies of the empty
Blue press me further
Into Zennor Hill.
 
If I half-close my eyes
The spiked light leaps in
And I am here as near
Happy as I will get
In the sailing afternoon.
 
 
    2
 
Enter a cloud. Between
The head of Zennor and
Gurnard’s Head the long
Marine horizon makes
A blue wall or is it
A distant table-top
Of the far-off simple sea.
 
Enter a cloud. O cloud,
I see you entering from
Your west gathering yourself
Together into a white
Headlong. And now you move
And stream out of the Gurnard,
The west corner of my eye.
 
Enter a cloud. The cloud’s
Changing shape is crossing
Slowly only an inch
Above the line of the sea.
Now nearly equidistant
Between Zennor and Gurnard’s
Head, an elongated
White anvil is sailing
Not wanting to be a symbol.
 
 
    3
 
Said nothing at all.
 
And proceeds with no idea
Of destination along
The sea bearing changing
Messages. Jean in London,
Lifting a cup, looking
Abstractedly out through
Her Hampstead glass will never
Be caught by your new shape
Above the chimneys. Jean,
Jean, do you not see
This cloud has been thought of
And written on Zennor Hill.

    4

The cloud is going beyond
What I can see or make.
Over up-country maybe
Albert Strick stops and waves
Caught in the middle of teeling
Broccoli for the winter.
The cloud is not there yet.

From Gurnard's Head to Zennor
Head the level line
Crosses my eyes lying
On buzzing Zennor Hill.

The cloud is only a wisp
And gone behind the Head.
It is funny I got the sea's
Horizontal slightly surrealist.
Now when I raise myself
Out of the bracken I see
The long empty blue
Between the fishing Gurnard
And Zennor. It was a cloud
The language at my time's
Disposal made use of.

    5

Thank you. And for your applause.
It has been a pleasure. I
Have never enjoyed speaking more.
May I also thank the real ones
Who have made this possible.
First, the cloud itself. And now
Gurnard's Head and Zennor
Head. Also recognise
How I have been helped
By Jean and Madron's Albert
Strick (He is a real man.)
And good words like brambles,
Bower, spiked, fox, anvil, teeling.

The bees you heard are from
A hive owned by my friend
Garfield down there below
In the house by Zennor Church.

The good blue sun is pressing
Me into Zennor Hill.

Gently disintegrate me
Said nothing at all."
1336,Approaches to How They Behave,W. S. Graham,"1
 
What does it matter if the words
I choose, in the order I choose them in,
Go out into a silence I know
Nothing about, there to be let
In and entertained and charmed
Out of their master’s orders? And yet
I would like to see where they go
And how without me they behave.
 

2
 
Speaking is difficult and one tries
To be exact and yet not to
Exact the prime intention to death.
On the other hand the appearance of things
Must not be made to mean another
Thing. It is a kind of triumph
To see them and to put them down
As what they are. The inadequacy
Of the living, animal language drives
Us all to metaphor and an attempt
To organize the spaces we think
We have made occur between the words.
 

3
 
The bad word and the bad word and
The word which glamours me with some
Quick face it pulls to make me let
It leave me to go across
In roughly your direction, hates
To go out maybe so completely
On another silence not its own.
 

4
 
Before I know it they are out
Afloat in the head which freezes them.
Then I suppose I take the best
Away and leave the others arranged
Like floating bergs to sink a convoy.
 

5
 
One word says to its mate O
I do not think we go together
Are we doing any good here
Why do we find ourselves put down?
The mate pleased to be spoken to
Looks up from the line below
And says well that doubtful god
Who has us here is far from sure
How we on our own tickle the chin
Of the prince or the dame that lets us in.
 

6
 
The dark companion is a star
Very present like a dark poem
Far and unreadable just out
At the edge of this poem floating.
It is not more or less a dark
Companion poem to the poem.
 

7
 
Language is expensive if
We want to strut, busked out
Showing our best on silence.
Good Morning. That is a bonny doing
Of verbs you wear with the celandine
Catching the same sun as mine.
You wear your dress like a prince but
A country’s prince beyond my ken.
Through the chinks in your lyric coat
My ear catches a royal glimpse
Of fuzzed flesh, unworded body.
Was there something you wanted to say?
I myself dress up in what I can
Afford on the broadway. Underneath
My overcoat of the time’s slang
I am fashionable enough wearing
The grave-clothes of my generous masters.
 

8
 
And what are you supposed to say
I asked a new word but it kept mum.
I had secretly admired always
What I thought it was here for.
But I was wrong when I looked it up
Between the painted boards. It said
Something it was never very likely
I could fit in to a poem in my life.
 

9
 
The good word said I am not pressed
For time. I have all the foxglove day
And all my user’s days to give
You my attention. Shines the red
Fox in the digitalis grove.
Choose me choose me. Guess which
Word I am here calling myself
The best. If you can’t fit me in
To lying down here among the fox
Glove towers of the moment, say
I am yours the more you use me. Tomorrow
Same place same time give me a ring.
 

10
 
Backwards the poem’s just as good.
We human angels as we read
Read back as we gobble the words up.
Allowing the poem to represent
A recognizable landscape
Sprouting green up or letting green
With all its weight of love hang
To gravity’s sweet affection,
Arse-versa it is the same object,
Even although the last word seems
To have sung first, or the breakfast lark
Sings up from the bottom of the sea.

 
11
 
The poem is not a string of knots
Tied for a meaning of another time
And county, unreadable, found
By chance. The poem is not a henge
Or Easter Island emerged Longnose
Or a tally used by early unknown
Peoples. The words we breathe and puff
Are our utensils down the dream
Into the manhole. Replace the cover.

 
12
 
The words are mine. The thoughts are all
Yours as they occur behind
The bat of your vast unseen eyes.
These words are as you see them put
Down on the dead-still page. They have
No ability above their station.
Their station on silence is exact.
What you do with them is nobody’s business.

 
13
 
Running across the language lightly
This morning in the hangingover
Whistling light from the window, I
Was tripped and caught into the whole
Formal scheme which Art is.
I had only meant to enjoy
Dallying between the imaginary
And imaginary’s opposite
With a thought or two up my sleeve.
 
 
14
 
Is the word? Yes Yes. But I hear
A sound without words from another
Person I can’t see at my elbow.
A sigh to be proud of. You? Me?
 
 
15
 
Having to construct the silence first
To speak out on I realize
The silence even itself floats
At my ear-side with a character
I have not met before. Hello
Hello I shout but that silence
Floats steady, will not be marked
By an off-hand shout. For some reason
It refuses to be broken now
By what I thought was worth saying.
If I wait a while, if I look out
At the heavy greedy rooks on the wall
It will disperse. Now I construct
A new silence I hope to break."

Sophocles who said as lover you want
ice to be ice yet not melt

implying permanence, might let us believe,
a moment, the seated figures are beyond the leaf
that cannot keep from letting go the branch,
beyond even stupidly purpling grapes

by which they darken; darken nevertheless."

Of his one minute on earth.
And hear the virgin juries
Talk with his own breath
To the corner boys of his street.
And hear the Black Maria
Searching the town at night.
And hear the playropes caa
The sister Mary in.
And hear Willie and Davie
Among bracken of Narnain
Sing in a mist heavy
With myrtle and listeners.
And hear the higher town
Weep a petition of fears
At the poorhouse close upon
The public heartbeat.
And hear the children tig
And run with my own feet
Into the netting drag
Of a suiciding principle.
Listen. Put on lightbreak.
Waken into miracle.
The audience lies awake
Under the tenements
Under the sugar docks
Under the printed moments.
The centuries turn their locks
And open under the hill
Their inherited books and doors
All gathered to distil
Like happy berry pickers
One voice to talk to us.
Yes listen. It carries away
The second and the years
Till the heart’s in a jacket of snow
And the head’s in a helmet white
And the song sleeps to be wakened
By the morning ear bright.
Listen. Put on morning.
Waken into falling light."
1341,The Night City,W. S. Graham,"Unmet at Euston in a dream
Of London under Turner’s steam
Misting the iron gantries, I
Found myself running away
From Scotland into the golden city.
 
I ran down Gray’s Inn Road and ran
Till I was under a black bridge.
This was me at nineteen
Late at night arriving between
The buildings of the City of London.
 
And the I (O I have fallen down)
Fell in my dream beside the Bank
Of England’s wall to be, me
With my money belt of Northern ice.
I found Eliot and he said yes
 
And sprang into a Holmes cab.
Boswell passed me in the fog
Going to visit Whistler who
Was with John Donne who had just seen
Paul Potts shouting on Soho Green.
 
Midnight. I hear the moon
Light chiming on St Paul’s.
 
The City is empty. Night
Watchmen are drinking their tea,
 
The Fire had burnt out.
The Plague’s pits had closed
And gone into literature.
 
Between the big buildings
I sat like a flea crouched
In the stopped works of a watch."
1342,A Reminiscence,Richard O. Moore,"Held in a late season
At a shifting of worlds,
In the golden balance of autumn,
Out of love and reason
 
We made our peace;
Stood still in October
In the failing light and sought,
Each in the other, ease
 
And release from silence,
From the slow damnation
Of speech that is weak
And falls from silence.
 
In the October sun
By the green river we spoke,
Late in October, the leaves
Of the water maples had fallen.
 
But whatever we said
In the bright leaves was lost,
Quick as the leaf-fall,
Brittle and blood red.           

                  For Kenneth Rexroth, 1950"
1343,"SAME SUN, SAME MOON, SAME RIVER",Neil Carpathios,"It is easy to imagine Heraclitus
walking stone streets witnessing
life in Athens with no permanence,
stopping strangers to explain about the river,
being laughed at as they moved
from point A to point B fearing Apollo
and Hades then at dusk drinking wine, 
waiting for the happy obliteration alcohol brings,
not realizing how lucky they were
to be stupid and so deep
in their bodies even the sun
and moon trading places over and over
meant nothing."
1344,"d e l e t e, Part 2",Richard O. Moore,"Set up curbside, jewelry tray entanglement with things looking up, but nothing sells unless there is someone looking down, and who might that be? For the moment it’s not raining and off-coast in pods the gray whales parade south. Photographs sprout with the season. The gray whale’s spout is heart shaped, enough said. Just listen for the icon’s intake of breath and see what you can see. Yes, but that was yesterday and which way are prices going to go? There is a pack forming and they will need a leader. It’s then you kick the snot out of them, not before, and make it believable this one last time; but don’t depend on it, auditors, even though it’s turned out like this so many times before. There may be an image whose mind has changed. Sorry, no rain checks in this scheme of things, the windows are broken and boards keep out the light, it’s the cheapest thing to do and then forget it, as has been done before, before, etc. Could you pick out of a lineup who is the culprit here? The mirror is one-way and there’s no way to be sure which side you’re on, but so what? Go on making faces anyway, but be sure, now and then, to check your hand before your face, if just to say Wheaties, the best is yet to be. Our inventions, gods and needles, for instance, are built to say this to us ever and forever. It’s obvious why we can’t give them up, they’re ours, for ourself self’s sake! We live in the afterlife of what, unalterable, has already taken place. The minute you start acting like Robinson Crusoe it’s plain to see you’ve lost your hold on the world. There are many such, so many, washed up on our island shores! They end up sleeping over grates and in doorways at night, far distant from tree ripe fruit and warm sand. The dumps of our artifacts bewilder them. They probe, not knowing what to expect from excess. They act out an experiment, a hairline calculation for survival: is the expenditure of energy to dig up carrots from the frozen ground more than their return in calories? Did you notice the price tag when the wine was poured, the cool chardonnay, the special cabernet, white and red absurdities of words? The motion lights are set to react outside the house but, tell me, did you see the clutter in the study, one would think! Those catalogs, the cave, shadows."
1345,"d e l e t e, Part 6",Richard O. Moore,"Assume you have discovered an entropy of spirit, immeasurable of course, but it pulls graveward all those whose element is breath, not as the in and out again of water and the sun, but oblivion’s ass-first downhill twenty-four-hour drag. Knowledge is an after-the-fact affair, fair game for a hunger striker’s skeptic gopher tooth. Remember your “agenbite of inwit,” but don’t, please don’t, go knocking on doors declaring you’ve gone hollow with all the others, no one will believe you so long as your bag of flesh is fair. Fall down the stairs to another street. Have you noticed nature does not care for you, no matter the pathos of your fallacies, your antiperspirant, or you arms folded over the stretch marks of your hardest years? That’s you, cell mate, roping a Platonic calf. Rare air, this is all you’ll catch and never can. Live on that for a week and leave a message on your machine, “nourished by words alone.” Those fireworks you inherited, where are they now? Will you set them off to end the show? You have a story that simply cannot be sold, and no rewrite can change country or cast, so here you are in never-never land again. That figure off there in the mist is Nietzsche, stay clear, they say his breath is vile, he needs his space or so the professors say. Were you handed this out of an old script or are you improvising this to-do? Whatever you are, an actor or a human merely with all the other actors, or can you tell the difference without a script in hand, you talk about a text that is not there. Each morning your own short-form obituary appears on every page. An open mike will follow. But this is only in the babblesphere, don’t inhale those dialogues that bubble up. Weariness grows in direct proportion to answers that recede nightly as you snore. Did you audition for this part or did you win it in an all-night poker game? The difference is the same, none, today. Don’t give your chips to another to bet, that’s stacking the odds in your favor, sharing the blame. Avoid places where the lights are always on. Try finding a sunset through a simple gift of looking west. There can be too much light for your own good. Pace Pascal. Let someone close your eyes. Necessary, or so I’m told. That hand in front of your face, try it now."
1346,The Great Tsunami,Michele Wolf,"She recognizes its crest in the way he looks at her. 
The wave is as vast as the roiling mass in the Japanese
Print they had paused in front of at the museum,
Capped with ringlets of foam, all surging sinew.
That little village along the shore would be
Totally lost. There is no escaping this.
The wave is flooding his heart,
And he is sending the flood
Her way. It rushes
Over her.

Can you look at one face
For the whole of a life?

Does the moon peer down
At the tides and hunger for home?"
1347,Man with Picture Frame,Michele Wolf,"90th and Third, NYC

We almost missed him, although his face,
As blunt as a busy Picasso, all shifting
Planes, was wedged in a picture frame.  
We almost missed him, the way one can stop
Seeing hunched-over bodies along the street
Or a favorite picture above the sofa
In the living room, so familiar it seems
Invisible, until it has drifted askew
Or been removed.  ""If only he had something
More contemporary,"" my companion offered.
The man in the frame extended his crushed
Paper coffee cup, fingers hugging its Greek
Pillars and statues, white and blue.
""Spare any change?"" he asked.  I brought
Forth a quarter.  His eyes, brilliant, said
 I am a masterpiece.  This is where I live."
1348,Of What is Real,Richard Tagett,"I like to lie with you wordless
on black cloud rooft beach
in late june 5 o’clock tempest
on clump weed bed with sand
fitting your contours like tailor made
 
and I like to wash my summer brown face
in north cold hudson rapids
with octagon soap
  knees niched in steamy rocks
  where last night’s frog stared
  at our buddhist sleep
 
but most of all I like to see
the morning happen . . .
 
I like to go down vertical mountains
where lanny goshkitch
meditated
  crashing poplars
  sap sticky arms flailing
  as thermosed green tea
  anoints sneakers
  and blood soakt brow I taste and love
  myself a split second
 
and I like to feel my own full scrotum
as I horizon the whole crisp linen earth
in my beatitude waiting miguel-like
in maskt fantasy for christ-like
you—
whoever you are
 
but most of all I like to see
the morning happen . . .
 
I like to look at books howl
haikus of the seasons
of the mind
that I might know the knowing
and the simplest to think of all of us
taking turns at catching each other
in the rye
 
and I like to taste cold absinthe
on hot hung sunday mornings
discussing orgies symposiums
and sounds with hoary headed poets
in upstairs jazz club
in Japan
 
but most of all I like to see
the morning happen when k and ike still sleep
and only the denver night riders hum contrasts
to orient jazzy feather beasts
in the dewy garden of real earth
where I can sink my naked feet

1349,Pocono Lakeside,Michele Wolf,"As I was guided by the director through the thick space
Of these rooms, worn sparrow brown, and strode
With the August sun on my shoulders across this particular
Acre of grass, nobody had told me this was the place
Where you had summered as a boy.  I have weathered
My fourth decade, older now than you were
When you died. I can barely remember you, yet I can see
You not as my father but as my son. You are age nine.
The downpour divides into two massive stage curtains
Parting. You bolt from the bunk, loudly racing
With your chums down the slippery hill to the dock,
Your cape of a towel flapping as if ready to lift you airborne.

You are the smallest. Still, you always run in the front.
You do not know how beautiful you are, of course, squinting
Against the sun, the flame that escapes behind the gray
Vapor for hours, sometimes for days. You cannot see
That from the beginning it has been eyeing you from afar,
That it has focused its golden spotlight just for you."

1351,The Sleeping Gypsy,Michele Wolf,"Henri Rouseeau, 1897

In the heat of her dream, she hears
The iron kettle boiling, its scuttle and hum
As hurried as hoofbeats across a plain.
She drops in two guinea hens. Dancing
In a ring round her skirts, the children
Cheer, “Auntie, the English song!”  Lifting
Her lute, she sings of the cat and the fiddle,
The cow jumping over the moon.  How the little
Ones hoot when the dish runs away
With the spoon.  Ah, spoon—an uncloaked
Lute, it waits to be strummed. The temptation of London, of Paris,
Of bumping along in the carriage with M. Philippe
In his top hat and greatcoat to visit
The peacocks, turquoise and gold and green, each
Roaming the Bois de Boulogne with one hundred eyes.

She sleeps in the desert, under a smiling full moon
That shines in the teal night. Quiet behind her,
A lion stands, tail erect, having sniffed
At her onyx flesh, at the ribbony stripes
His color-blindness darkens on her muslin dress,
All rainbow hues. She is lost in a dream,
Always happiest out of doors, without shoes."
1352,Triptych for Believers,Richard Tagett,"I
 

Hung up on body parts in the particulate daylight, you step out of a Beckett play to find yourself in a memory resisting itself, as meat hits the fan so to speak against the white blanket of the grainy void. You never know where it’s going, the body, the boy swathed in bullets with those black eyes pissing a letter-opener in the desert mud near a disabled Mercedes. When things enter the room you think bazooka and check your hat. A puddle of warm ice-cream in anticipation. Here’s where Coney Island drops like a discarded napkin and you can’t go home again. Mucous brimming the banks, a cake of dust in the shape of a rocking chair ticking away. But soon it will snow as exquisite dogs languish from inside a sandwich tied to a parachute. No time for ballads, the table is set.

Light solidifies in cells, the keeper of lost keys. They don’t belong to anyone, the keys. Playing the game backwards reveals nothing a blind child could not guess by the hairs on his arm. The lips on old men are lockboxes in the terminal of no-knowing without gratitude for the despair of angels. You have to suffer, you have to fill up in order to implode, to be recognized for the necessities of commerce. They unhinge, finally, the doors you walk through into phantom stairwells in telephonic hum smelling of wet coal and doll’s hair. Precipitous adjectives gush from a cracked faucet in the chancellery restroom. Someone is stifling laughter from underneath a card table where an electric utility had fallen from his sleeve. They say that trussed birds derive no pleasure from the music of mangled wagons and that gas seeps like a well-kept secret imperiling dust mites in the spleens of hooded maidens locked away from the light. Everything is descending, even the scholarship of the ancient adverbs. Mouths twist into almonds and you wonder how the noise can drown itself out with nothing but nouns and dinner plates and gallows, with history a hiccup waiting to happen.

The music is an absence of colliding masses. You can cut your feet on the proverbial and be too close to hear it, the other music, the suffocation of things that can’t fly. A beautiful cacophony flutters in the brightness of dead calm as true objects lost in the politeness of daylight fill the grail of a new primitive. You choke on little candles and all through the night your legs cramp in the sweat of the moonlight. For no good reason a tenderness of geese is billowing in the curtains, as holes in the face open and close and paper scorches sky with futile encryption. Those armchairs foundering in the scum of the surf. Deafness craving disaster green in the spine, knowing the cocktail party’s over. Now it’s all red and your lips are trembling in believability, but it’s only a flickering image in the dark quadrant of your eye bending the light as they mow the daisies under the stars, for no good reason."
1353,A Certain Kind of Eden,Kay Ryan,"It seems like you could, but
you can’t go back and pull
the roots and runners and replant.
It’s all too deep for that.
You’ve overprized intention,
have mistaken any bent you’re given
for control. You thought you chose
the bean and chose the soil.
You even thought you abandoned
one or two gardens. But those things
keep growing where we put them—
if we put them at all.
A certain kind of Eden holds us thrall.
Even the one vine that tendrils out alone
in time turns on its own impulse,
twisting back down its upward course
a strong and then a stronger rope,
the greenest saddest strongest
kind of hope."
1354,D.O.A.,Tim Dlugos,"“You knew who I was
when I walked in the door.
You thought that I was dead.
Well, I am dead. A man
can walk and talk and even
breathe and still be dead.”
Edmond O’Brien is perspiring
and chewing up the scenery
in my favorite film noir,
 D.O.A. I can’t stop watching,
can’t stop relating. When I walked down
Columbus to Endicott last night
to pick up Tor’s new novel,
I felt the eyes of every
Puerto Rican teen, crackhead,
yuppie couple focus on my cane
and makeup. “You’re dead,”
they seemed to say in chorus.
Somewhere in a dark bar
years ago, I picked up “luminous
poisoning.” My eyes glowed
as I sipped my drink. After that,
there was no cure, no turning back.
I had to find out what was gnawing
at my gut. The hardest part’s
not even the physical effects:
stumbling like a drunk (Edmond
O’Brien was one of Hollywood’s
most active lushes) through
Forties sets, alternating sweats
and fevers, reptilian spots
on face and scalp. It’s having
to say goodbye like the scene
where soundtrack violins go crazy
as O’Brien gives his last embrace
to his girlfriend-cum-Girl
Friday, Paula, played by Pamela
Britton. They’re filmdom’s least
likely lovers—the squat and jowly
alkie and the homely fundamentally
talentless actress who would hit
the height of her fame as the pillhead-
acting landlady on My Favorite Martian
fifteen years in the future. I don’t have
fifteen years, and neither does Edmond
O’Brien. He has just enough time to tell
Paula how much he loves her, then
to drive off in a convertible
for the showdown with his killer.
I’d like to have a showdown too, if I
could figure out which pistol-packing
brilliantined and ruthless villain
in a hound’s-tooth overcoat took
my life. Lust, addiction, being
in the wrong place at the wrong
time? That’s not the whole
story. Absolute fidelity
to the truth of what I felt, open
to the moment, and in every case
a kind of love: all of the above
brought me to this tottering
self-conscious state—pneumonia,
emaciation, grisly cancer,
no future, heart of gold,
passionate engagement with a great
B film, a glorious summer
afternoon in which to pick up
the ripest plum tomatoes of the year
and prosciutto for the feast I’ll cook
tonight for the man I love,
phone calls from my friends
and a walk to the park, ignoring
stares, to clear my head. A day
like any, like no other. Not so bad
for the dead."
1355,The Far West,Tim Dlugos,"The city and the continent
trail off into cold black
water the same way: at
the western edge, a flat
stretch with precipitous
planes set perpendicular
and back from the beach
or beach-equivalent, a blacktop
margin where the drugged
and dying trudge, queue up
for Hades. Bolinas
had its junkie lady with gray
skin, gray sweater, stumbling
through the sand with the short-
burst intensity and long-run aimlessness
of crackhead hustlers on the West Street piers.
Dreams of Bolinas haunted me for years
before I saw it. I’d huddle
at the foot of the cliff in a cold
wind late at night, wrapped
in Indian blankets, waiting
with strangers as the tidal wave
or temblor hit. Tonight I walk
with old friends in a new dream
past a vest-pocket park of great
formality and charm in the far
West Village. My disaffected
former confidant has grown
a pony tail and cruises up
the street on a “hog,” a “chopper,”
which seems a perfect locomotive choice.
I walk out to the quay where gondola
after enormous gondola departs
for “the other side,” not New Jersey
anymore, anymore than something
prosaic as another mass of land
past the bright horizon
could function as a mirror
of the chopped-away Bolinas hill.
O western edge, where points
of interest on maps of individual
hearts and bodies disappear
in waters of a depth unfathomable
even in a dream, I had thought
that sleep was meant to blunt
your sharpness, not to hone
and polish with the lapping
of the hungry waves of Lethe."
1356,G-9,Tim Dlugos,"I'm at a double wake
in Springfield, for a childhood
friend and his father
who died years ago. I join
my aunt in the queue of mourners
and walk into a brown study,
a sepia room with books
and magazines. The father's
in a coffin; he looks exhumed,
the worse for wear. But where
my friend's remains should be
there's just the empty base
of an urn. Where are his ashes?
His mother hands me
a paper cup with pills:
leucovorin, Zovirax,
and AZT.  ""Henry
wanted you to have these,""
she sneers. ""Take all
you want, for all the good
they'll do.""  ""Dlugos.
Meester Dlugos.""  A lamp
snaps on. Raquel,
not Welch, the chubby
nurse, is standing by my bed.
It's 6 a.m., time to flush
the heplock and hook up
the I.V. line. False dawn
is changing into day, infusing
the sky above the Hudson
with a flush of light.
My roommate stirs
beyond the pinstriped curtain.
My first time here on G-9,
the AIDS ward, the cheery
D & D Building intentionality
of the decor made me feel
like jumping out a window.
I'd been lying on a gurney
in an E.R. corridor
for nineteen hours, next to
a psychotic druggie
with a voice like Abbie
Hoffman's. He was tied
up, or down, with strips
of cloth (he'd tried to slug
a nurse) and sent up
a grating adenoidal whine
all night. ""Nurse . . . nurse . . .
untie me, please . . . these
rags have strange powers.""
By the time they found
a bed for me, I was in
no mood to appreciate the clever
curtains in my room,
the same fabric exactly
as the drapes and sheets
of a P-town guest house
in which I once—partied? stayed?
All I can remember is
the pattern. Nor did it
help to have the biggest queen
on the nursing staff
clap his hands delightedly
and welcome me to AIDS-land.
I wanted to drop
dead immediately. That
was the low point. Today
these people are my friends,
in the process of restoring
me to life a second time.
I can walk and talk
and breathe simultaneously
now. I draw a breath
and sing ""Happy Birthday""
to my roommate Joe.
He's 51 today. I didn't think
he'd make it. Three weeks
ago they told him that he had
aplastic anemia, and nothing
could be done. Joe had been
a rotten patient, moaning
operatically, throwing chairs
at nurses. When he got
the bad news, there was
a big change. He called
the relatives with whom
he had been disaffected,
was anointed and communicated
for the first time since the age
of eight when he was raped
by a priest, and made a will.
As death drew nearer, Joe
grew nicer, almost serene.
Then the anemia
began to disappear, not
because of medicines, but
on its own. Ready to die,
it looks like Joe has more
of life to go. He'll go
home soon. ""When will you
get out of here?"" he asks me.
I don't know; when the X-ray
shows no more pneumonia.
I've been here three weeks
this time. What have I
accomplished? Read some
Balzac, spent ""quality
time"" with friends, come back
from death's door, and
prayed, prayed a lot.
Barry Bragg, a former
lover of a former
lover and a new
Episcopalian, has AIDS too,
and gave me a leatherbound
and gold-trimmed copy of the Office,
the one with all the antiphons.
My list of daily intercessions
is as long as a Russian
novel. I pray about AIDS
last. Last week I made a list
of all my friends who've died
or who are living and infected.
Every day since, I've remembered
someone I forgot to list.
This morning it was Chasen
Gaver, the performance poet
from DC. I don't know
if he's still around. I liked
him and could never stand
his poetry, which made it
difficult to be a friend,
although I wanted to defend
him one excruciating night
at a Folio reading, where
Chasen snapped his fingers
and danced around spouting
frothy nonsense about Andy
Warhol to the rolling eyes
of self-important ""language-
centered"" poets, whose dismissive
attitude and ugly manners
were worse by far than anything
that Chasen ever wrote.
Charles was his real name;
a classmate at Antioch
dubbed him ""Chasen,"" after
the restaurant, I guess.
Once I start remembering,
so much comes back.
There are forty-nine names
on my list of the dead,
thirty-two names of the sick.
Cookie Mueller changed
lists Saturday. They all
will, I guess, the living,
I mean, unless I go
before them, in which case
I may be on somebody’s
list myself. It’s hard
to imagine so many people
I love dying, but no harder
than to comprehend so many
already gone. My beloved
Bobby, maniac and boyfriend.
Barry reminded me that he
had sex with Bobby
on the coat pile at this Christmas
party, two years in a row.
That’s the way our life
together used to be, a lot
of great adventures. Who’ll
remember Bobby’s stories
about driving in his debutante
date’s father’s white Mercedes
from hole to hole of the golf course
at the poshest country club
in Birmingham at 3 a.m.,
or taking off his clothes
in the redneck bar on a dare,
or working on Stay Hungry
as the dresser of a then-
unknown named Schwarzenegger.
Who will be around to anthologize
his purple cracker similes:
“Sweatin’ like a nigger
on Election Day,” “Hotter
than a half-fucked fox
in a forest fire.” The ones
that I remember have to do
with heat, Bobby shirtless,
sweating on the dance floor
of the tiny bar in what is now
a shelter for the indigent
with AIDS on the dockstrip,
stripping shirts off Chuck Shaw,
Barry Bragg and me, rolling
up the tom rags, using them
as pom-poms, then bolting
off down West Street, gracefully
(despite the overwhelming
weight of his inebriation)
vaulting over trash cans
as he sang, “I like to be
in America” in a Puerto Rican
accent. When I pass,
who’ll remember, who will care
about these joys and wonders?
I’m haunted by that more
than by the faces
of the dead and dying.
A speaker crackles near
my bed and nurses
streak down the corridor.
The black guy on the respirator
next door bought the farm,
Maria tells me later, but
only when I ask. She has tears
in her eyes. She’d known him
since his first day on G-9
a long time ago. Will I also
become a fond, fondly regarded
regular, back for stays
the way retired retiring
widowers return to the hotel
in Nova Scotia or Provence
where they vacationed with
their wives? I expect so, although
that’s down the road; today’s
enough to fill my plate. A bell
rings, like the gong that marks
the start of a fight. It’s 10
and Derek’s here to make
the bed, Derek who at 16
saw Bob Marley’s funeral
in the football stadium
in Kingston, hot tears
pouring down his face.
He sings as he folds
linens, “You can fool
some of the people some
of the time,” dancing
a little softshoe as he works.
There’s a reason he came in
just now; Divorce Court
drones on Joe’s TV, and
Derek is hooked. I can’t
believe the script is plausible
to him, Jamaican hipster
that he is, but he stands
transfixed by the parade
of faithless wives and screwed-up
husbands. The judge is testy;
so am I, unwilling
auditor of drivel. Phone
my friends to block it out:
David, Jane and Eileen. I missed
the bash for David’s magazine
on Monday and Eileen’s reading
last night. Jane says that
Marie-Christine flew off
to Marseilles where her mother
has cancer of the brain,
reminding me that AIDS
is just a tiny fragment
of life’s pain. Eileen has
been thinking about Bobby, too,
the dinner that we threw
when he returned to New York
after getting sick. Pencil-thin,
disfigured by KS, he held forth
with as much kinetic charm
as ever. What we have
to cherish is not only
what we can recall of how
things were before the plague,
but how we each responded
once it started. People
have been great to me.
An avalanche of love
has come my way
since I got sick, and not
just moral support.
Jaime’s on the board
of PEN’s new fund
for AIDS; he’s helping out.
Don Windham slipped a check
inside a note, and Brad
Gooch got me something
from the Howard Brookner Fund.
Who’d have thought when we
dressed up in ladies’
clothes for a night for a hoot
in Brad (“June Buntt”) and
Howard (“Lili La Lean”)’s suite
at the Chelsea that things
would have turned out this way:
Howard is dead at 35, Chris Cox
(“Kay Sera Sera”)’s friend Bill
gone too, “Bernadette of Lourdes”
(guess who) with AIDS,
God knows how many positive.
Those 14th Street wigs and enormous
stingers and Martinis don’t
provoke nostalgia for a time
when love and death were less
inextricably linked, but
for the stories we would tell
the morning after, best
when they involved our friends,
second-best, our heroes.
J.J. Mitchell was master
of the genre. When he learned
he had AIDS, I told him
he should write them down.
His mind went first. I’ll tell you
one of his best. J.J. was
Jerome Robbins’ houseguest
At Bridgehampton. Every morning
they would have a contest
to see who could finish
the Times crossword first.
Robbins always won, until
a day when he was clearly
baffled. Grumbling, scratching
over letters, he finally
threw his pen down. “J.J.,
tell me what I’m doing wrong.”
One clue was “Great 20th-c.
choreographer.” The solution
was “Massine,” but Robbins
had placed his own name
in the space. Every word
around it had been changed
to try to make the puzzle
work, except that answer.
At this point there’d be
a horsey laugh from J.J.
—“Isn’t that great?”
he’d say through clenched
teeth (“Locust Valley lockjaw”).
It was, and there were lots
more where that one came from,
only you can’t get there anymore.
He’s dropped into the maw
waiting for the G-9
denizens and for all flesh,
as silent as the hearts
that beat upon the beds
up here: the heart of the drop-
dead beautiful East Village
kid who came in yesterday,
Charles Frost’s heart nine inches
from the spleen they’re taking
out tomorrow, the heart of
the demented girl whose screams
roll down the hallways
late at night, hearts that long
for lovers, for reprieve,
for old lives, for another chance.
My heart, so calm most days,
sinks like a brick
to think of all that heartache.
I’ve been staying sane with
program tools, turning everything
over to God “as I understand
him.”  I don’t understand him.
Thank God I read so much
Calvin last spring; the absolute
necessity of blind obedience
to a sometimes comforting,
sometimes repellent, always
incomprehensible Source
of light and life stayed
with me. God can seem
so foreign, a parent
from another country,
like my Dad and his own
father speaking Polish
in the kitchen. I wouldn’t
trust a father or a God
too much like me, though.
That is why I pack up all
my cares and woes, and load them
on the conveyor belt, the speed
of which I can’t control, like
Chaplin on the assembly line
in Modern Times or Lucy on TV.
I don’t need to run
machines today. I’m standing
on a moving sidewalk
headed for the dark
or light, whatever’s there.
Duncan Hannah visits, and
we talk of out-of-body
experiences. His was
amazing. Bingeing on vodka
in his dorm at Bard, he woke
to see a naked boy
in fetal posture on the floor.
Was it a corpse, a classmate,
a pickup from the blackout
of the previous night? Duncan
didn’t know. He struggled
out of bed, walked over
to the youth, and touched
his shoulder. The boy turned;
it was Duncan himself.
My own experience was
milder, don’t make me flee
screaming from the room
as Duncan did. It happened
on a Tibetan meditation
weekend at the Cowley Fathers’
house in Cambridge.
Michael Koonsman led it,
healer whose enormous paws
directed energy. He touched
my spine to straighten up
my posture, and I gasped
at the rush. We were chanting
to Tara, goddess of compassion
and peace, in the basement chapel
late at night. I felt myself
drawn upward, not levitating
physically, but still somehow
above my body. A sense
of bliss surrounded me.
It lasted ten or fifteen
minutes. When I came down,
my forehead hurt. The spot
where the “third eye” appears
in Buddhist art felt
as though someone had pushed
a pencil through it.
The soreness lasted for a week.
Michael wasn’t surprised.
He did a lot of work
with people with AIDS
in the epidemic’s early days
but when he started losing
weight and having trouble
with a cough, he was filled
with denial. By the time
he checked into St. Luke’s,
he was in dreadful shape.
The respirator down his throat
squelched the contagious
enthusiasm of his voice,
but he could still spell out
what he wanted to say
on a plastic Ouija board
beside his bed. When
the doctor who came in
to tell him the results
of his bronchoscopy said,
“Father, I’m afraid I have
bad news,” Michael grabbed
the board and spelled,
“The truth is always
Good News.” After he died,
I had a dream in which
I was a student in a class
that he was posthumously
teaching. With mock annoyance
he exclaimed, “Oh, Tim!
I can’t believe you really think
that AIDS is a disease!”
There’s evidence in that
direction, I’ll tell him
if the dream recurs: the shiny
hamburger-in-lucite look
of the big lesion on my face;
the smaller ones I daub
with makeup; the loss
of forty pounds in a year;
the fatigue that comes on
at the least convenient times.
The symptoms float like algae
on the surface of the grace
that buoys me up today.
Arthur comes in with
the Sacrament, and we have
to leave the room (Joe’s
Italian family has arrived
for birthday cheer) to find
some quiet. Walk out
to the breezeway, where
it might as well be
August for the stifling
heat. On Amsterdam,
pedestrians and drivers are
oblivious to our small aerie,
as we peer through the grille
like cloistered nuns. Since
leaving G-9 the first time,
I always slow my car down
on this block, and stare up
at this window, to the unit
where my life was saved.
It’s strange how quickly
hospitals feel foreign
when you leave, and how normal
their conventions seem as soon
as you check in. From below,
it’s like checking out the windows
of the West Street Jail; hard
to imagine what goes on there,
even if you know firsthand.
The sun is going down as I
receive communion. I wish
the rite’s familiar magic
didn’t dull my gratitude
for this enormous gift.
I wish I had a closer personal
relationship with Christ,
which I know sounds corny
and alarming. Janet Campbell
gave me a remarkable ikon
the last time I was here;
Christ is in a chair, a throne,
and St. John the Divine,
an androgyne who looks a bit
like Janet, rests his head
upon the Savior’s shoulder.
James Madden, priest of Cowley,
dead of cancer earlier
this year at 39, gave her
the image, telling her not to
be afraid to imitate St. John.
There may come a time when
I’m unable to respond with words,
or works, or gratitude to AIDS;
a time when my attitude
caves in, when I’m as weak
as the men who lie across
the dayroom couches hour
after hour, watching sitcoms,
drawing blanks. Maybe
my head will be shaved
and scarred from surgery;
maybe I’ll be pencil-
thin and paler than
a ghost, pale as the vesper
light outside my window now.
It would be good to know
that I could close my eyes
and lean my head back
on his shoulder then,
as natural and trusting
as I’d be with a cherished
love. At this moment,
Chris walks in, Christopher
Earl Wiss of Kansas City
and New York, my lover,
my last lover, my first
healthy and enduring relationship
in sobriety, the man
with whom I choose
to share what I have
left of life and time.
This is the hardest
and happiest moment
of the day. G-9
is no place to affirm
a relationship. Two hours
in a chair beside my bed
after eight hours of work
night after night for weeks
… it’s been a long haul,
and Chris gets tired.
Last week he exploded,
“I hate this, I hate your
being sick and having AIDS
and lying in a hospital
where I can only see you
with a visitor’s pass. I hate
that this is going to
get worse.” I hate it,
too. We kiss, embrace,
and Chris climbs into bed
beside me, to air-mattress
squeaks. Hold on. We hold on
to each other, to a hope
of how we’ll be when I get out.
Let him hold on, please
don’t let him lose his
willingness to stick with me,
to make love and to make
love work, to extend
the happiness we’ve shared.
Please don’t let AIDS
make me a monster
or a burden is my prayer.
Too soon, Chris has to leave.
I walk him to the elevator
bank, then totter back
so Raquel can open my I.V.
again. It’s not even
mid-evening, but I’m nodding
off. My life’s so full, even
(especially?) when I’m here
on G-9. When it’s time
to move on to the next step,
that will be a great adventure,
too. Helena Hughes, Tibetan
Buddhist, tells me that
there are three stages in death.
The first is white, like passing
through a thick but porous wall.
The second stage is red;
the third is black; and then
you’re finished, ready
for the next event. I’m glad
she has a road map, but I don’t
feel the need for one myself.
I’ve trust enough in all
that’s happened in my life,
the unexpected love
and gentleness that rushes in
to fill the arid spaces
in my heart, the way the city
glow fills up the sky
above the river, making it
seem less than night. When
Joe O’Hare flew in last week,
he asked what were the best
times of my New York years;
I said “Today,” and meant it.
I hope that death will lift me
by the hair like an angel
in a Hebrew myth, snatch me with
the strength of sleep’s embrace,
and gently set me down
where I’m supposed to be,
in just the right place."
1357,Gilligan’s Island,Tim Dlugos,"The Professor and Ginger are standing in the space in front
of the Skipper’s cabin. The Professor is wearing deck shoes,
brushed denim jeans, and a white shirt open at the throat.
Ginger is wearing spike heels, false eyelashes, and a white
satin kimono. The Professor looks at her with veiled lust
in his eyes. He raises an articulate eyebrow and addresses
her as Cio-Cio-San. Ginger blanches and falls on her knife.
 
* * *
 
Meanwhile it is raining in northern California. In a tiny
village on the coast, Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are totally
concerned. They realize that something terrible is happening.
Each has been savagely attacked by a wild songbird within
the last twenty-four hours. Outside their window thousands
of birds have gathered in anticipation of the famous school-
yard scene. Tippi Hedren is wearing a colorful lipstick.
 
* * *
 
Ginger stares back at the Professor. His sullen good looks
are the perfect foil for her radiant smile. The Skipper and
Gilligan come into sight. The Skipper has been chasing
Gilligan around the lagoon for a long time now. Gilligan
holds onto his hat in the stupid way he has of doing things
like that. The Professor’s lips part in a sneer of perfect
contempt. Ginger bares her teeth, as if in appreciation.
 
* * *
 
Jackie Kennedy bares her teeth. Behind and above her, the
muzzle of a high-powered rifle protrudes from a window. A little
man is aiming at Jackie Kennedy’s husband. The man is wearing
bluejeans and a white T-shirt. There isn’t a bird to be seen.
As he squeezes the trigger, the little man mutters between
clenched teeth, “Certs is a candy mint.” The hands of Jackie
Kennedy’s husband jerk automatically toward his head.
 
* * *
 
The Professor is noticing Ginger’s breasts. He thinks of
the wife he left at home, who probably thinks he’s dead.
He thinks of his mother, and all of the women he has ever
known. Mr. and Mrs. Howell are asleep in their hut, secure
in their little lives as character actors. Ginger shifts her
weight to the other foot. The intensity of the moment reminds
the Professor of a Japanese city before the end of the war.
 
* * *
 
In his mind he goes down each aisle in his government class,
focusing on each face, each body. He is lying on his bed
with his white shirt off and his trousers open. Dorothy
Kirsten’s voice fills the room. He settles on a boy who sits
two desks behind him. He begins to masturbate, his body moving
in time with the sad music. At moments like these he feels
farthest away. As he shoots, his lips part and he bares his teeth.
 
* * *
 
The Professor and Ginger are watching each other across the
narrow space. The Skipper and Gilligan have disappeared down
the beach. The Howells are quietly snoring. The Professor
and Ginger are alone. From the woods comes the sound of
strange birds. From the water comes a thick and eerie
tropical silence. The famous conversation scene is about
to start. Clouds appear in the sky, and it begins to snow."
1358,Ordinary Time,Tim Dlugos,"Which are the magic
moments in ordinary
time? All of them,
for those who can see.
That is what redemption
means, I decide
at the meeting. Then
walk with David wearing
his new Yale T-shirt
and new long hair to 103.
Leonard and Eileen come, too.
Leonard wears a shark’s tooth
on a chain around his neck
and long blond hair.
These days he’s the manager
of Boots and Saddles (“Bras
and Girdles,” my beloved
Bobby used to say) and
costumer for the Gay Cable
Network’s Dating Game.
One week the announcer is
a rhinestone cowboy, sequin
shirt and black fur chaps,
the next a leatherman, etc.
Eileen’s crewcut makes
her face light up.
Underneath our hairstyles,
23 years of sobriety, all told—
the age of a girl who’s “not
so young but not so very old,”
wrote Berryman, who flew
from his recovery with the force
of a poet hitting bottom.
It’s not the way I choose
to go out of this restaurant
or day today, and I
have a choice. Wanda
the comedian comes over
to our table. “Call me
wicked Wanda,” she smirks
when we’re introduced.
Why is New York City
awash in stand-up comics
at the least funny point
in its history? Still,
some things stay the same.
People wonder what the people
in their buildings would think
if the ones who were wondering
became incredibly famous,
as famous as Madonna.
Debby Harry lived in Eileen’s
building in the Village
in the early seventies, and she
was just the shy girl
in the band upstairs.
Poets read the writing
of their friends, and
are happy when they like it
thoroughly, when the work’s
that good and the crippling
sense of competition stays away.
Trips get planned: David
home to California, Eileen
to New Mexico, Chris and I
to France and Spain, on vectors
which will spread out
from a single point, like ribs
of an umbrella. Then
after the comfort of a wedge
of blueberry peach pie and cup
of Decaf, sober friends
thread separate ways home
through the maze of blankets
on the sidewalk covered with
the scraps of someone else’s life.
Mine consists of understanding
that the magic isn’t something
that I make, but something
that shines through the things
I make and do and say
the way a brooch or scrap of fabric
shines from the detritus
to catch Leonard’s eye
and be of use for costumes,
when I am fearless and thorough
enough to give it room,
all the room there is in ordinary
time, which embraces all
the people and events and hopes
that choke the street tonight
and still leaves room for everyone
and everything and every
other place, the undescribed
and indescribable, more various
and cacophonous than voice
can tell or mind conceive,
and for the sky’s vast depths
from which they’re all
a speck of light."
1359,Parachute,Tim Dlugos,"The Bergman image of a game
of chess with Death,
though not in a dreamscape
black-and-white as melancholy
films clanking with symbols,
but in a garden in Provence
with goldfish in the fountain
and enormous palms whose topmost
fronds cut into the eternal
blue of sky above the Roman
ruins and the dusty streets
where any door may lead to life’s
most perfect meal: that is what
I think of when I remember
I have AIDS. But when
I think of how AIDS kills
my friends, especially
the ones whose paths
through life have least
prepared them to resist
the monster, I think of
an insatiable and prowling beast
with razor teeth and a persistent
stink that sticks to every
living branch of flower
its rank fur brushes
as it stalks its prey.
I think of that disgusting
animal eating my beautiful friends,
innocent as baby deer. Dwight:
so delicate and vain, his spindly
arms and legs pinned down with needles,
pain of tubes and needles, his narrow
chest inflated by machine, his mind
lost in the seven-minute gap
between the respirator’s failure
and the time the nurses noticed
something wrong. I wrapped
my limbs around that fragile body
for the first time seven years
ago, in a cheap hotel by the piers,
where every bit of his extravagant
wardrobe—snakeskin boots, skin-tight
pedal pushers in a leopard print,
aviator’s scarves, and an electric-
green capacious leather jacket—
lay wrapped in a corner of
his room in a yellow parachute.
It's hard enough to find a parachute
in New York City, I remember thinking,
but finding one the right shade
of canary is the accomplishment
of the sort of citizen with whom
I wish to populate my life.
Dwight the dancer, Dwight the fashion
illustrator and the fashion plate,
Dwight the child, the borderline
transvestite, Dwight the frightened,
infuriating me because an anti-AZT
diatribe by some eccentric
in a rag convinced him not to take
the pills with which he might
still be alive, Dwight
on the runway, Dwight on the phone
suggesting we could still have sex
if we wore “raincoats,” Dwight
screwing a girl from Massapequa
in the ladies’ room at Danceteria
(he wore more makeup and had better
jewelry than she did), Dwight planning
the trip to London or Berlin where he
would be discovered and his life
transformed. Dwight erased,
evicted from his own young body.
Dwight dead. At Bellevue, I wrapped
my arms around his second skin
of gauze and scars and tubing,
brushed my hand against
his plats, and said goodbye.
I hope I’m not the one
who loosed the devouring animal
that massacred you, gentle boy.
You didn’t have a clue
to how you might stave off
the beast. I feel so confident
most days that I can stay
alive, survive and thrive
with AIDS. But when I see
Dwight smile and hear his fey
delighted voice inside my head,
I know AIDS is no chess game
but a hunt, and there is no
way of escaping the bloody
horror of the kill, no way
to bail out, no bright
parachute beside my bed."
1360,Pretty Convincing,Tim Dlugos,"Talking to my friend Emily, whose drinking
patterns and extravagance of personal
feeling are a lot like mine, I’m pretty
convinced when she explains the things we do
while drinking (a cocktail to celebrate the new
account turns into a party that lasts till 3
a.m. and a terrific hangover) indicate
a problem of a sort I’d not considered.
I’ve been worried about how I metabolize
the sauce for four years, since my second bout
of hepatitis, when I kissed all the girls
at Christmas dinner and turned bright yellow
Christmas night, but never about whether
I could handle it. It’s been more of a given,
the stage set for my life as an artistic queer,
as much of a tradition in these New York circles
as incense for Catholics or German
shepherds for the blind. We re-enact
the rituals, and our faces, like smoky icons
in a certain light, seem to learn nothing
but understand all. It comforts me
yet isn’t all that pleasant, like drinking
Ripple to remember high school. A friend
of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades,
talking to the same types, but progressively
fewer blonds. Joe LeSueur says he’s glad
to have been a young man in the Fifties with his
Tab Hunter good looks, because that was the image
men desired; now it’s the Puerto Rican
angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity
that springs out of machismo, rather than a moral
choice. His argument is pretty convincing, too,
except lots of the pretty blonds I’ve known
default by dying young, leaving the field
to the swarthy. Cameron Burke, the dancer
and waiter at Magoo’s, killed on his way home from
the Pines when a car hit his bike on the Sunrise Highway.
Henry Post dead of AIDS, a man I thought would be around
forever, surprising me by his mortality the way
I was surprised when I heard he was not
the grandson of Emily Post at all, just pretending,
like the friend he wrote about in Playgirl, Blair Meehan,
was faking when he crashed every A List party for a year
by pretending to be Kay Meehan’s son, a masquerade
that ended when a hostess told him “Your mother’s here”
and led him by the hand to the dowager—Woman, behold
thy son—underneath a darkening conviction that all,
if not wrong, was not right. By now Henry may have faced
the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky.
Stay as outrageously nasty as you were. And Patrick
Mack, locked into memory as he held court in the Anvil
by the downstairs pinball machine, and writhing
as he danced in Lita Hornick’s parlor when the Stimulators
played her party, dead last week of causes I don’t know,
as if the cause and not the effect were the problem.
My blond friend Chuck Shaw refers to the Bone-
crusher in the Sky, and I’m starting to
imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant
heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods,
flickering on at twilight as I used to do
in the years when I crashed more parties and acted
more outrageously and met more beauties and made
more enemies than ever before or ever again, I pray.
It’s spring and there’s another crop of kids
with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self-esteem
from my arrival in New York, who plug into the history
of prettiness, convincing to themselves and the devout.
We who are about to catch the eye of someone
new salute as the cotillion passes, led by blonds
and followed by the rest of us, a formal march
to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out
onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia
that hides the trash sprout magically
at our approach. I toast it
as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent
as a blond in love. My clothes smell like the smoky
bar, but the sweetness of the April air’s
delicious when I step outside and fill
my lungs, leaning my head back
in a first-class seat on the shuttle
between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds
to come and an enormous Irish wake in which
the corpses change but the party goes on forever."
1361,Song for Connie,Bill Berkson,"The sun met the moon at the corner
           noon in thin air
 
Commotion you later
           choose to notice
 
Love shapes the heart
           that once was pieces
 
You take in hand
           the heart in mind
 
Your fate’s consistent
           alongside mine
 
Unless a mess
           your best guess
 
That is right, thanks, the intimate
           fact that you elect it
 
At corners, dressed or naked, with lips taste        
           full body, time thick or thin, fixated
 
Love, take heart
           as heart takes shape
 
And recognition
           ceases to be obscure
 
One line down the center
           another flying outward enters"
1362,White Petals,Tim Dlugos,"The Republic lies in the blossoms of Washington.  —Robert Bly

White petals
drop into the dark river.
Heedless of political significance,
they ride out to the sea like stars.
 
I'm the space explorer.
I travel to a planet
where there are no plants or animals.
Everyone lives in harmony.
I don't want to go home.
 
I'm the pioneer man and the pioneer woman,
both at the same time.
I build my house with my own hands,
and it's beautiful,
with simple, perfect lines.
 
I'm the farmer waiting for the vegetables
to grow, so I can eat.
I'm the hunter aiming at the bear.
I don't want to shoot it, but my family needs meat.
The bear gives me a long dumb animal look.
We'll use his skin for blankets,
his fat to light our lamps.
Our cabin will stink all night.
 
I'm the cabin boy who graduates to captain.
Shipboard sex is rough, but it suits my taste.
I'm the man on the steps of the house
where the President's widow lives.
All night I wait for the stranger
to get out of his car
so I can flash my look of recognition.
 
I'm the cowpoke who sleeps with his horses.
I'm the man who loves dogs.
I'm the cranky President sneaking away
to swim in the Potomac.
 
I'm the black man.
I close my eyes
and it gets dark inside.
 
I feel the sun on my face.
I see the light through my eyelids.
It's bright, intelligent
free of all cares.
 
I'm the heir of a great American family.
My success is guaranteed.
Unexpected tragedy is all that can stop me.
I'm the popular senator teaching his son to shave."
1363,An Ether,Robert VanderMolen,"Past the fountain out of repair
And the boarded diner

A small studio
You’d never told anyone about

Where old clothes have remained
Right where you’ve dumped them

Side by side
With random notes and sketches

When someone close to you
Has a different idea of what you represent

He insisted
You’ll write a check for the loan

There were other misjudgments
As well. Exits were being blocked

Down every hall I walked

Until a sort of muscle memory—
Well, I knew it all along, of course,

But thought it was in the future,
It rested like a memory—

This desire 
For a place respecting anonymity

Oiling your .38 Special,
Like a criminal readying for benefits

A bottle of Jack Daniels—

This and more

Shaded by echoing buildings
With a glance toward the harbor

The water rough with small debris
Today"
1364,Animal Farm,Marcus Wicker,"Consider the toucan’s festive gold breast.
Its multicolored pecker, oddly cutesy  
& perhaps, a cartoon-comfort 
to the gym-roped Westerners
reclining on a beach in Costa Rica. 
It’s the same old song: good-natured
smile, hard work, a hat’s off kind
of attitude & before you can say
post-racial, you’re a Resort Toucan.
The benefits are room & board
but the cost is blood. Most times
it’s the closest ones—birds
of the same rainforest, same
quadrant, same tree—who give up 
your whereabouts to the jaguar. 
Quick as you got the gig, the boss 
is tossing you out on your ass 
all over some flipped umbrellas   
& a tourist’s scarfed thumb. So now
you’re roofless, alone, vulnerable
& the beast is licking his chops
in your mirrored aviators. Stifling 
too is the Midwestern Subdivision
in its treatment of the black squirrel.    
Science tells us black squirrels
have driven out native grey squirrels 
in numerous areas, but no bullshit 
in my development, black squirrels 
are relegated to lots with a view
of the highway. Mornings
they work shade for acorns
between homes narrow as Lincoln Logs.
History tells us black squirrels
can’t afford robust landscaping
but will pay their mortgage—
chair the neighborhood watch
if you like. Slenderizing, their night
of hair. They’re sun’s prey. 
They avoid overexposure, make tanning
trend. Black squirrels
they fit in, get along. Know no one.
They see other black squirrels & run."
1365,As If,J. Allyn Rosser,"How do you explain why elephants
appear to move their unwieldy hulks
with greater dignity than most humans do
in their finest moments,
as if they had evolved beyond wanting
anything but what they have?
Why does the field begin to ripple
before the wind arrives in whispers,
as if there were a communication,
as if the landscape were poorly dubbed,
and we weren’t expected to notice?
What butterfly does not dart away from us
as if it could sense our latent cruelties,
and yet return to check and double-check? 
Has the night not gotten recently darker,
as if to insinuate that we have squandered 
the light that was there?
Have we made too much of our own?
And did you notice afterward the dawn 
opening up with a tentative eagerness
as if there were something crucial to illumine,
as if we would wake up early just to see it?
I imagine you reading this now 
with an expression of quiet trouble
itself troubled by currents of hope, 
as if you imagined me here with you, 
as if I might be able to see your expression,
and at least answer it with mine."
1366,Bay Window Lauds,Marcus Wicker,"Cul-de-sac Pastoral

The sill plays a cruel joke—thrones me. Frames me
lording over lawn mower stripes—myself

in a shallow trench. In grass blades. Myself
persisting, despite a dickhead sun—me

in chlorophyll. Early, I find myself
swaying—me! in the black chokeberry, me!

in the rabbit’s throat. Me, the rabbit. Me  
dancing out pellets. Out-dancing myself—

my father’s pellet gun, the hawk. The joke
is a bright belly full of dark hopping

along my father’s garden & the joke
small, between wrapped talons, is the hawking

too, is the axe sun, swift, rising, this joy.
This joy, it swallows itself far too soon!"
1367,Bedivere/Horatio,A. F. Moritz,"Each living thing is like a kingdom
that rises not quite out of nothing: April stirrings
of some boy and the May beauty
of a generous princess. Then came children—
who could calculate their splendor?
And there were factories in valleys, mile after mile,
dragons of purple smoke, blue flames at night,
castles hidden in forests equally hidden
where a shining company rode through flowers
to pacify the dangerous land. Triangular sails,
violet, saffron, and rose, glowed beyond coves
under cliffs dangling silver torques of waterfall.
Later the parents aged and grew more grateful,
more full of a certainty that could not be glimpsed
or dismayed, and then the children
were gone to some other land
as if to heaven, yet the mourning
was not for death. Now by a quiet wall
buckled cement gives a bright home
to milkweeds like strange skeletons,
pale green, intact and upright, and tall white grasses
that never wave. The sole survivor—
a duty was laid on him
to tell the tale among new minds, other ways,
and how do we imagine him,
wherever he’s gone—all that remains,
scholar of an unread book,
beggar of an unfilled cup,
an unknown variation,
the thought of the kingdom in a lost man?"
1368,Birdsong,Joanie Mackowski,"Bustle and caw. Recall the green heat 
rising from the new minted earth, granite

and basalt, proto-continents shuffling
and stacking the deck, first shadows flung 

from the ultraviolet haze. A fern 
uncurls from the swamp, the microscopic furnace

of replication warms the world, one 
becoming two, two four: exponential blossom. 

Lush with collision, the teacup balance 
of x and y, cells like balloons

escaping into the sky—then the dumbstruck
hour, unmoored by a river,

a first fish creeps to the land to marvel
at the monstrous buds of its toes. And stars

grow feet and walk across the years, into these dozing,
ordinary days, climbing the spine’s winding

stair, where crickets yawn and history spins."
1369,Bone and Hue,Olivia Clare,"There was a young woman 
who lived in her shoes.

Bare-backed, she sat 
with elders and sheened 
her nails with sloe. 

Felt purse, trunk, 
berries in bottled gin.

Smoke rose 
from the purples of the ground. 

Moscow maybe next, or 
Poland, where the numbers burned.

Purples of the mosses turned.
Some million shades.
Six million more.

Purples of the mosses,
and all the millions, blue.

She had so many lives,
she didn’t know what to do."
1370,Brutal,Andrea Cohen,"Brutal to give
the prisoner a window—
a blue sky glimpse—

as if an afterlife
existed. Brutal
for you to parade 

in a body
in the same 
room where I dream you."
1371,Bryant Park at Dusk,Geoffrey Brock,"Floodlights have flared on behind and above
              Where I sit in my public chair.
The lawn that had gradually darkened has brightened.
              The library windows stare.

I’m alone in a crowd—e pluribus plures.
              Far from a family I miss.
I’d almost say I’m lonely, but lonely
              Is worse, I recall, than this.

Loneliness is a genuine poverty.
              I’m like a man who is flush
But forgot his wallet on the nightstand 
              When he left for work in a rush,

And now must go without food and coffee
              For a few hours more than he’d wish. 
That’s all. He still has a wallet. It’s bulging.
              It floats through his brain like a fish...

Money for love: a terrible simile,
              But maybe it’s fitting here,
A couple of blocks from Madison Avenue
              Where commodities are dear,

Where all around me, rich skyscrapers 
              Woo the impoverished sky,
Having sent on their way the spent commuters 
              Who stream, uncertain, by—

And as for this whole splurge of a city, 
              Isn’t money at its heart?
But I’m blathering now. Forgetting my subject.
              What I meant to say at the start

Is that I noticed a woman reading
              In a chair not far from mine.
Silver-haired, calm, she stirred a hunger 
              Hard for me to define,

Perhaps because she doesn’t seem lonely.
              And what I loved was this:
The way, when dusk had darkened her pages, 
              As if expecting a kiss,

She closed her eyes and threw her head back,
              Book open on her lap.
Perhaps she was thinking about her story,
              Or the fall air, or a nap.

I thought she’d leave me then for pastimes
              More suited to the dark.
But she is on intimate terms, it seems,
              With the rhythms of Bryant Park,

For that’s when the floodlights came on, slowly,
              Somewhere far above my need, 
And the grass grew green again, and the woman
              Reopened her eyes to read."
1372,Caned,Terese Svoboda,"A stick, pared clean—no, a silver-topped
bamboo-with-dagger, class doubling as club,
the advantage of gravity lifted high 
overcoming the disadvantage of poking ahead.

He demurs. Weakness either way.
A man should crush opponents with a word.
Naive, I muse, at your age. A cane
replaces the sole’s sensors, bolsters them. 

Balance is a matter for the unbalanced, 
he says, all nuance, accusing me, Lear-lover,
of too much. The earth is now close, I tell him.
A sharp look. I’ll walk, he says, without."
1373,Capital One,John Hodgen,"All day I have been thinking about the color of his cauterized skin,

the burned young man lying flat on his back on the rehab slab in Wiesbaden,

and think, finally, that it is the color of rhubarb, that drab maroon and green,

but seared on, blasted into a mottled, speckled, crystallized sheen.

Rhubarb
, meaning a fight or disagreement, the ump getting into it with a player,

their faces turning red, sputtering, blustering, kicking dirt on each other,

until finally someone gets vulgar, says something about the other one’s mother.

Rhubarb
, from the ancient word for the Volga River, its watery line of demarcation,

and the barbarians who lived beyond it, the real ones, Vandals, Visigoths, Huns,

not the ones we see now as buffoons in commercials, battle-axing, caterwauling

the civilized world for the right credit card, for Capital One, asking us what’s in

our wallets. CNN says the rehab here is good, so the film crew has come in.

They thank him for his service. They tell him he’s a credit to his country, to all of us,

all our brave young women and men. They ask if he has any hobbies, if he can tell us

what he’d most want to do that he used to enjoy doing. He says he’d like to walk again.

I hate everyone, all of us who have sent him into flames. I hate the film crew, hate 
CNN
, the rehab facility, every tube that goes in and out of him, every monitor that beeps, even the morphine feed that drips and seeps. They ask him if it is frustrating and he weeps."
1374,Clover,T. Zachary Cotler,"On a brain-gray day,
                                      he lay on the hill-slanted solar
array with a southern exposure,
toes in the clover
                                mixed in with what are these
pentagrammatic sprays
of pinnate leaves.
                                No clover
here has four leaves:
to each one he says
I have seen you before
                                          in the nuclear hazard 
symbol and then again (as 
again slants backward) 
before that, as nothing but clover
                                                             when childhood was not yet over
and everything was symbol therefore 
nothing was."
1375,Crash Test Dummies of an Imperfect God,Dean Young,"Because we are so stupid,
the prizes in Cracker Jacks are now paper
so they can be swallowed, ladders
spackled with warnings. No getting
within a hundred feet of Stonehenge because
everyone wants to hack off a souvenir
and the way home is clogged to one lane
so whoever wants to can stare into a pothole
until coming up with a grievance. I’d vote
the greatest accomplishment of mankind
is the pickle spear. God created paradise
to tell us Get out! which is why we probably
created God who doesn’t much like being created
by ilk like us. No wonder it’s pediatrics
every morning and toxicology by happy hour.
Is it all in the mind, the dirty, dirty mind?
Maybe God tried to turn you into a garbage can
so you could be lifted by the truck’s hydraulic
arms and banged empty. Maybe a snow cone
so you could be sticky-sweet and dropped.
Maybe a genital-faced bivalve to be dashed
with Tabasco and eaten whole or, to his glory,
produce a pearl."
1376,"Dear Bob,",Dean Young,"The mountain thinks it’s the same
without you but it’s wrong. Maybe
the same stars whisking themselves
further off, the darker the brighter,
same chamomile crushed underfoot
but the little, wiry dog we loved
has preceded us into paradise, not
that I expect to join her even though
my own crappy heart’s worse, running’s
out but I may be finally learning how
to sit in a chair. I still don’t know
what to call the good morning bird
although whatever word’d be no truer
than manzanita. I think namelessness
has a crush on me, on how clean
I keep my room, the usual stunned
ruckus of wake up. But it’s a different
moon, different woman on the hotel balcony
yet the same kinda scary, vacant stare,
caryatid foreseeing what? Before
turning back to the customary, immaculate
vacation squalor inside. The cash machine
still says “enter to exit” but there’s
more water in the creek than I’ve ever seen,
the brighter the darker, in that first dream
there was none."
1377,Don Giovanni,Olivia Clare,"Women asleep. Carlight,
east red and west white.

Women, and men made of them,
and lambs in their droves, and power lines east

to the women-made men and women of men,
when a man is a sum
of what women he knows, and I 

blurred my vision till I
saw a woman and lambs in the streets,
west red and white east,

and I wanted to eat. Women and men,
don’t fear me, I am 
a hand come to wake her. Red 

in the west says
woman is man is woman is man."
1378,The End of Landscape,Randall Mann,"There's a certain sadness to this body of water
adjacent to the runway, its reeds and weeds,
handful of ducks, the water color
 
manmade. A still life. And still
life's a cold exercise in looking back,
back to Florida, craning my neck
 
like a sandhill crane in Alachua Basin.
As for the scrub oaks,
the hot wind in the leaves was language,
 
Spanish moss—dusky, parasitic—
an obsession: I wanted to live in it.
(One professor in exile did,
 
covered himself in the stuff as a joke—
then spent a week removing mites.) That's
enough. The fields of rushes lay filled
 
with water, and I said farewell,
my high ship an old, red Volvo DL,
gone to another coast, another peninsula,
 
one without sleep or amphibious music.
Tonight, in flight from San Francisco—
because everything is truer at a remove—
 
I watch the man I love watch
the turn of the Sacramento River, then Sacramento,
lit city of legislation and flat land.
 
I think of Florida, how flat.
I think of forgetting Florida.
And then the landscape grows black."
1379,Enoch’s Blocks,Olivia Clare,"Little Enoch learned his colors from lettered blocks

(for a is the color of fleet,
b is the color of war and demolition,
c is the color of echo and blur,
&c.) and built
a bricolage:

So cab was a whirring warbler.
bach was the Spanish Armada crashing
                                      and crashing.
And enoch he couldn’t describe.

And when it reached the height of Enoch,
standing, he tore whole tongues
down to their colors."
1380,Epiphany,Joanie Mackowski,"A momentary rupture to the vision: 
the wavering limbs of a birch fashion

the fluttering hem of the deity’s garment, 
the cooling cup of coffee the ocean the deity

waltzes across. This is enough—but sometimes
the deity’s heady ta-da coaxes the cherries 

in our mental slot machine to line up, and
our brains summon flickering silver like 

salmon spawning a river; the jury decides
in our favor, and we’re free to see, for now. 

A flaw swells from the facets of a day, increasing
the day’s value; a freakish postage stamp mails

our envelope outside time; hairy, claw-like
magnolia buds bloom from bare branches; 

and the deity pops up again like a girl from 
a giant cake. O deity: you transfixing transgressor,

translating back and forth on the border
without a passport. Fleeing revolutions 

of same-old simultaneous boredom and 
boredom, we hoard epiphanies under the bed, 

stuff them in jars and bury them in the backyard; 
we cram our closet with sunrise; prop up our feet 

and drink gallons of wow!; we visit the doctor 
because all this is raising the blood’s levels of 

c6h3(oh)2chohch2nhch3, the heart caught 
in the deity’s hem and haw, the oh unfurling 

from our chest like a bee from our cup of coffee, 
an autochthonous greeting: there. Who saw it?"
1381,Essential Poem,A. F. Moritz,"For John Hollander

Although it’s likely you’re on your own
at this moment in this city of three million
reading the poems of Traherne,
and there was no one till you lit your lamp,
the kingdom of childhood keeps being founded
in his voice and his seeing,
which are a sort of birth. A birth goes on
in the dark of a poor family, or a mother alone.
Then comes the small bright circle of the faces:
lover pores over sleeping loved one, parent over child
in their enclosure we name home,
a hut in the plain so bare there’s not a tongue
of grass to make the wind hiss. Unknown
to the world a world exists:
trees and streams, birds all the colors of the flowers.
So Traherne pours over you
his wild remembrance of the world to come. And would
even in the silence of his book
if it were lost and lay unopened
two hundred years. Even if he had died
before he sang the Eden in his look."
1382,Grendel’s Mother,Heidy Steidlmayer,"When the moon’s worn scutcheon 
touches the flint-gray flood,
I will lave him in foxglove 
and vetch until the blood
of his wretched heart heals.

Without a scar, he stood—

as the men make their way 
into the quaking wood."
1383,Handy Guide,Dean Young,"Avoid adjectives of scale.
Dandelion broth instead of duck soup.
Don’t even think you’ve seen a meadow, ever.
The minor adjustments in our equations
still indicate the universe is insane,
when it laughs a silk dress comes out its mouth
but we never put it on. Put it on.
Cry often and while asleep.
If it’s raw, forge it in fire.
That’s not a mountain, that’s crumble.
If it’s fire, swallow.
The heart of a scarecrow isn’t geometrical.
That’s not a diamond, it’s salt.
That’s not the sky but it’s not your fault.
My dragon may be your neurotoxin.
Your electrocardiogram may be my fortune cookie.
Once an angel has made an annunciation,
it’s impossible to tell him he has the wrong address.
Moonlight has its own befuddlements.
The rest of us can wear the wolf mask if we want
or look like reflections wandered off.
Eventually armor, eventually sunk.
You wanted love and expected what?
A parachute? Morphine? A gold sticker star?
The moment you were born—
you have to trust others because you weren’t there.
Ditto death.
The strongest gift I was ever given
was made of twigs.
It didn’t matter which way it broke."
1384,If,John Rybicki,"For Julie

If I could tie a river around my love’s waist like ribbon, 
              make sails out of her blood
and pin down death like a squirming bug.

If I could lift and rock each coffin in my arms
              I would start with hers."
1385,Like Gods,John Koethe,"The philosopher David Lewis spun a fantasy of two omniscient gods who know about one world, which might as well be ours. Each knows precisely all there is to know, the grand “totality of facts, not things.” Each knows the pattern of the light on each neglected leaf millennia ago. Each knows the number of the stars, their ages, all the distances between them, all the “things too tiny to be remembered in recorded history—the backfiring of a bus/In a Paris street in 1932,” as well as all the things that history distorts or just can’t see, like the thought that must have flashed across Patroklos’s mind (if he’d existed and had had a mind—the middle knowledge of the schoolmen) when Hektor split his stomach with a spear (if he’d existed too). Each one looks on, as though through ordinary eyes, as “Mme Swann’s enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as St George in the picture, endeavored to curb the ardour of the quivering steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered over the ground,” and sees “the gray ‘toppers’ of old” the gentlemen strolling with her wore, the little “woolen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge feathers” that she wore (or would have worn if they and she’d been real). Each monitors the photons through the slits, the slow decay of radium, and knows the ratio of vermouth to gin in someone’s first martini at Larre’s. Each knows what Darragh, Geoff and Willy knew before the bullet or the pavement killed their worlds, and where the shots came from in Dallas. Each knows precisely what the other knows, in all the senses of those words, and if a question has a factual answer, each can answer it. Yet there’s a question neither can resolve: which god am I?

The question posits both a world and a unique perspective on that world, which neither has. And if gods One and Two could reify themselves by wondering who or what they were, they’d have to know the answer—and, because they don’t, they can’t. Could gods like those be real, in something like the sense that you and I are real? But then, what sense is that? Gods One and Two are you and I writ large: I wander out into the day and feel the sunlight on my face. I see the sunlight on the first spring leaves like green foam on the trees, and so do you. The world we have in common, that the gods can comprehend in its entirety, remains beyond my grasp, and yours. The world I know belongs entirely to me, as yours belongs entirely to you. I know my world completely, as the gods know ours, because it’s nothing but my take on things, and starts and ends with me. I’m both the author and the captive of my world, because my take on things is all there is to me. When Mary, in Frank Jackson’s philosophical diversion, wanders from her room of black and white and shades of gray and finally sees a rose, and then goes on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, and drinks coffee, and talks for hours, it’s hard to see how all of 
this
 (as she might say) could be an artifact of her perspective. But it is.

So what? Philosophers tell stories, but they make them up, and what are they to me? Sometimes I think I’m humoring myself (a good thing I suppose) with an extended exercise in nonsense. 
Have breakfast, 
have a cup of strong black common sense, get over it
, I tell myself, refuting Berkeley with my foot. Instead of this entanglement of self with self, why can’t I just relax into my place inside the natural order, be a thing within the solid scheme of things, a Dane in Denmark? How can fantasies, unreal by definition, show me what I am, and know? How can the poetry of possibilities dissolve the prose of facts? My little life sustains me while it can, and that’s enough. It may be all contingent, but it’s real, and when catastrophes occur, as they inevitably do, I’d rather they occur to me, instead of writing them away, or redefining happiness or sorrow or tranquility as alterations of some abstract point of view that points at nothing. Inescapable illusions must be real, or might as well be real, no matter where reflection on them leads; and if accepting them means taking things on faith, that’s fine. Who wants to be a posit, or a site of possibilities? Who wants to walk out and evaporate into this green spring day? Who wants to have sex with a wraith?

No matter where reflection on them leads
. It leads, of course, to me. A 
cri de coeur
 is not an argument, but where the real argument begins. Hopkins: “searching nature I taste 
self
 at one tankard, that of my own being.” Kant: “the 
feeling
 of an existence without the least concept,” meaning that despite the certainty I have, I’ve no idea what I really am, or where, and as for “searching nature,” I have no idea even where to start. These matters mean the world to me, and yet no matter how I try to come to grips with them, they slip away. 
I
 and 
here
 and 
now
 are ever present, yet they vanish in the act of apprehension, as a poem turns into language as you write it down. Dimensionless, atemporal, imprisoned in the present—even as I say them to myself the words fall short of what I thought I started out to say, like the conclusion of an argument too close to me to share, or like an empty thought balloon that hangs above me in the air. It’s not the question of what makes me who I am through time—of how a figure in a photograph from 1985, a couple sitting in the garden of the small Hôtel des Marronniers just off the rue Jacob, could be the person who remembers her and thinks of him today—but of what constitutes me now, and of what made me then. If giving it a name won’t help, then neither will pretending it’s divine. If I should be supplanted by a bright recording angel knowing everything about me in the way the gods know all about their world, I wouldn’t have survived. She takes the whole thing in—the house on Maxim Street, the bike rides down the hill on Wabash Street, my high school friends, their friends, the friends of friends of friends—with eyes that monitor my back, my face, the traces in my brain projected on a screen, the 
n
 degrees of separation linking me to nearly everyone who’s ever lived, a thing within a wilderness of things, with each one locked inside a universe with no outside, of which there’s nothing she can see. How could it be an afterlife? It’s just a different life, another life, complete or incomplete as anyone’s, consumed by questions that elude it, not because she can’t remember, but because the words that make them up are undefined: which one of them was I? which world was mine?"
1386,Little Wife,Marianne Boruch,"At the Oriental Institute, Chicago

They redid King Tut splendid, 
once stone-huge as this 
yet his wife’s feet 
tiny, the only thing of her now
low, next to him. A few toes, some of the rest, 
a bit of ankle, that’s it
in the shade of her husband’s looming, massive 
looking straight ahead into the future 
where we live and can’t
eye-to-eye, where to stare at him
is to suffer warbler neck, head back and up
à la the high just-leafing-out trees as bright bits
wing their blink
and hide. Little wife, 
such small feet, the thought 
dwarfs the king 
as ache, as what is 
ever left of us 
and oh, I like her better."
1387,Minnows 2,Ray Amorosi,"Whatever the cost I pay up at the minnow pools.
I don’t know anything of the misery of these trapped fish,
or the failure of the marsh I’m so hidden.

Up above is the island with its few houses facing
the ocean God walks with anyone there. I often
slosh through the low tide to a sister
unattached to causeways.

It’s where deer mate then lead their young
by my house to fields, again up above me.

Pray for me. Like myself be lost.
An amulet under your chest, a green sign of the first
rose you ever saw, the first shore.

Then I wash my horse, dogs, me behind the barn.
Only the narrow way leads home."
1388,My Death Space Dot Com,Bruce Bond,"Now that obituaries come online
with coroner reports and full disclosure, 
imagine the ways to betray a man 
come out of hiding to die. Ask the bloggers
who weigh in on my friend’s bad habit,
who make of it their own drug strung out
across a mirror, so when they pay tribute
to their power, how they had their doubts
about his talent, his flu, I think how lucky
I was to receive the kindness of the weak.
My death space, as they call it, as if it’s me
who died. A life, we know, is complex.
But death is simple. A place to talk shit,
to license grief, or barring that, to kill it."
1389,Ode,Ray Amorosi,"How glorious
is this strange muscle in my mouth.
Child’s tease, lips’ balm, baton of speech
unless it’s tied.

What’s forgotten is on the tip.
Sides slip out the truth. The root
is how far a kiss can go.

One can lose it when guilty.
Be lashed by another’s.
Feel it twisting over rooky woods and wordless
hear it swinging in a bell, sliding through a groove

or placed firmly in a cheek. Beware it
should be held most often for most often
a forked one has no friend."
1390,Sparrow,Farnoosh Fathi,"This was more like the atmosphere
had been pinched, whose chirp was an unexpected gust 
in a harmonium enough 
to break all that high horse talk
that curdles the atmosphere. While centaurs

ate grass and hurdled epitaphs, that chirp 
in the midst did change one of us. 
'Twas clawed out in a feeling’s flock
'Twas 'couraged by the tall grass
Did you not catch it? 

It is enough to gather at your age;
It is enough to note just what 
was said that provoked the Alps to rage. 
And the eye sews along. But can it cup 
a crazing off the tops of trees?

Just one eye as yours could be enough—
one for six moons that surround 
the mind’s water birth, while a lily on its cot
bloated, lapses. Sparrow, here again! Countless
consuls tower and luff but the world sizes
down to a restless heart:

To the one note that repeats itself and is all. 
To the note one repeats to one’s self and all. 
To the one line spitting the heart into flight. 

Metaphor is elsewhere, a jewel resulting 
in the snout of a pig. Sparrow, here—nearly unresting thing
which always seems suddenly to never have left 
my mind. Because you will so easily disappear, 
I think of you as infinitely near."
1391,from Supplice,T. Zachary Cotler,"Raking lace
at the fringe of the tide,
raking with fingers
the English and cutwork
and French of the froth,
with the negative black
dwarf sun in her eye echo
eye mirror eye, she, 
taking his fingers, 
English and Hebrew bones, 
bobbin bones, 
to lace with her own,
said love, if you like,
but abyss of light."
1392,Sympathy,Farnoosh Fathi,"Whose table is that, left on three legs?
If there’s been a mistake, it may be 
in assuming less vulnerability 
as one fills the vase—

whose buoyant comfort exaggerates 
at the sight of his own proffered, 
sympathetic hand, striking him so clean
in comparison

gloved white, magician—for a sec 
he even sees the calla lily’s furl
in the gesture of voilà!"
1393,Thanatos Machine,Terese Svoboda,"You don’t need a machine to do that.
A plastic bag will do. But he built it,
his tools cast about in the unit
while he got up his nerve to use it.

Nothing more was stored there.
A poured cement floor, a triple-locked door
after door after door down a corridor 
reeking with the odor of everything over.

In heretofore phrases, he left a note
outlining his Help! in argot
so wrought it was hopeless to ferret out
his intent, meant or not.

A ball-peen hammer was all she had.
The shards cut her. What else had he hid?
At least, she cried, he’d thought ahead.
He drove home instead."
1394,(This Line Intentionally Left Blank),J. Allyn Rosser,"we all got tickets to The Truth
finally we thought finally 
when the curtain fell away
our indrawn breaths could be heard
even in the next theater 
even the gasp of the mime 
who had slipped in among us
a loud whushing like reams of litter
whirling upward in a gale
hands shot to mouths and mouths 
fell open I couldn’t say within
how many seconds 
all our minds shut some 
slamming others just a click 
like 300 parallel
rows of tipped dominoes  
a racket of almost unison

believe me we wouldn’t 
have resisted anything 
but the truth
so instantly and universally
yet we sat there and waited 
for something else
which you could say we also got 
if you count the mime’s
unpleasant remark
so she wasn’t even a real mime
probably part of what was 
clearly just a performance"
1395,Time of Need,Allison Seay,"In the road, a dog. Days dead, 
that dog. Liliana was walking beside me awhile 
(I am sure) and I was almost not crying but then found 

what I was looking for. 
She heaved it for me—all of it, the stench, the weight—
in her thin arms until it was too much. 

Tired, she dragged the thing by its wasted paws 
all the way home. Her dress was stained. This is how 

I learned about love. She did not mind at all 
the silent, steady distance I placed between us."
1396,To See the Queen,Allison Seay,"Since I was the one who had been ill, it was me she came to see.
Everyone wanted a glimpse of her.
The people emerged from their houses toward mine 
and with such caution. 
They made a visor of their hands.
It was as if they were to be accounted for,
wading the long uphill, little moving triangles 
all I could distinguish at first.
But the queen came to see only me and I saw her. 
And my life for a while was dismissed
and so repaired."
1397,Town of Unspeakable Things,Allison Seay,"Then there was the time I looked directly into the face 
of the life I thought I was missing, 

of love. I used to think to be not alone meant 
never having to walk through the high wheat 

or struggle in the water. Not having to decide not
to fling from some height.

Once, the two of us rode one bicycle.
I wore a straw hat and perched on the handlebars 

and beside us the sea oats swayed like skirts 
and I heard a trilling in the crabgrass. 

The sidewalks were bleached as Grecian stone
as we rode past the fish shop smelling of morning—
salt, bread, limes, men.

Riding in front, it was such that 
I could not be heard always, at least not the first time

for you pedaled into the wind 
and my hair was a ribbon in your eyes.

I said I thought bougainvillea was a stoic plant 
and then had to say twice, no, stoic! and then 
no, the bougainvillea! and then you said easily 

it was nothing like that at all. 

But our future was clear enough when I asked if you saw 
the clean aprons of those men 

(how much longer you think until they clean the fish? 
did you see how white those aprons were? did you see?)

To which you said 
How much is it, then, you think you need?"
1398,The Way We Were Made,Marcus Wicker,"But you made every
delicate, elegant wrist
& glistening ankle.
But you made them
beautiful
in braided rope
& dime store gold. 
But you made every
necklace clasp.
But you made them
caress the nape
like an errant wind
after a shower. 
But you made every
eyelash erotic. Every
single strand of hair
soft.
But you made them
from dust & bone.
Made every glorious 
singing thigh. Every
button nose.
But you made them
with holes—
wide open
to the faintest hints
of salt
in a sea breeze, salt
in the sweaty mouth
of a navel, salt
in the blood, sweet
in every wrong way."
1399,West of Silicon Valley,T. Zachary Cotler,"A field of thistles, díscharging 
                  concentric waves of negative 
                                       theology, on a mountainside, 
                  2010, May 23rd (is Whitsuntide),
would certainly
suffice as a source of the ever-obtainable not

maybe even make some money while you’re up here—
ask why is each second so
                             charged with a feeling of living in freak
Götterdämmerung days
of live free radical notion or die into negative white on white sun pride
burning away, but equally
                             charged with utopian headlong longevity crowing—
why can’t I be steady? 
Why is my only 
balance built 
of collisions and 
cancelings-out of such sharp spike-of-chaos moods?

Field of thistles, 
red and green. 

Fields of dollars, thistles, 
solidi and yen 
and rand and rupees blowing off the curve of land."
1400,Wild Turkeys,Robert VanderMolen,"When Ronnie’s husband stepped out of the shower
She spotted bite marks on his buttocks

I was so listless
I wished the dog could talk

The room was frowsty. Then men
Were discussing the legacy of Wendell Willkie

Those little cupids of nostalgia
Fading into doubt...

All that fussing
Followed by a creamy silence—

Oh mother, my daughter said, you’re so ’80s

To winkle out meaning, I’ve given up,
I’m simply nosing through the thistle.

Prudish light of a candle
As night closes with a tail over water

A rufous backdrop of brush.
A clot of gardening tools

When Mrs. Mast took a photo in September
Of a cougar lounging beneath her clothesline
Everyone stopping strolling our lazy road.
Even Jack felt uncomfortable
Smoking a cigarette on the patio
Before retiring"
1401,Wizard,Ray Amorosi,"All this havoc
just means I’m a poor wizard.

Once, I lit three twigs and fanned the smoke,
from miles away,
into the girl who jumbled scales through my spine.

As she vanished I clapped a delighted tune.
But not without aches of my own.

Did the sack of no echoes fail me?

Now, on such a mild curse—
boils, sewn eyes, a shrew
in the loin my ankle reddens up and eyes me
with disdain. Toenails fall off.

How far will this go?

Poor wizard. Poorly done in.
These pangs are power are power as both
knees lock up
ashamed to move under me."
1402,The World Is in Pencil,Todd Boss,"—not pen. It’s got

that same silken 
dust about it, doesn’t it, 

that same sense of 
having been roughed 

onto paper even  
as it was planned. 

It had to be a labor
of love. It must’ve

taken its author some
time, some shove. 

I’ll bet it felt good
in the hand—the o

of the ocean, and
the and and the and 

of the land."
1403,The Youngest Two Hear Cicadas,Farnoosh Fathi,"Tennessee: We are here, between trees, 
with the tempo of a rosary being strung

there was music coming on

c: which though machinery-like 
moves not in cogs, and never
springs, but waves through

water gone dross

the branch turns from us, and is for some arc

1404,Going to Zero,Peter Balakian,"1.
 
 A canvas with less turpentine, more hard edges, less bleeding, 
 that was good for beauty, Frankenthaler in Art News
 
in the dining car crammed with parkas and laptops
micro-waved cellophane, plastic plates and canvas bags, 
 
and the valley under fog as the cows disappeared
and when the green came back into view I could see
 
the SUVs floating on the Thruway, the cows oblivious
to the revved engines of trucks. The river glistened
 
all the way to Albany, and I could see flags on Baptist churches
and resurrection trailers, “God Bless America” on pick-ups—
 
“United We Stand” laminated to billboards
as the fog settled then lifted, and when I woke
 
a flag the size of a football field hung from the gray tower of the GW,
where the tractor-trailers jammed beneath its hem
 
as something sifted down on the silver-plated Hudson.         
And then the lights went out.             
 
 
2.
 
The faces on 7th Avenue blurred in the chaos of vendors and liberty
scarves, freedom ties, glowing plastic torches, dollars and polyester—
 
and inside Macy’s I was hit by cool air as “Stars and Stripes Forever”
floated down from women's fashions into the quiet aisles of Aramis and silk scarves.
 
I wanted to buy the Frankenthaler, a modest, early print,
minimal, monochromatic; surface and perspective in dialogue;
on 24th off 10th—the gallery still smelled like wood and plaster—
 
but I didn't stop, and when the train reached the Stock Exchange
the Yom Kippur streets were quiet, and the bronze statue of Washington
was camouflaged by national guard. I was walking my old mail route now
 
like a drunk knocking into people, almost hit by a cab
until the roped-off streets cut me at the arm. At Broadway and Liberty
the fences wound around the bursts of dust rising
 
over the cranes and bulldozers, over the punched-out windows—
I stared through a piece of rusted grid that stood like a gate to the crystal river.
I was sweating in my sweatshirt now, the hood filling with soot, 
 
as I watched with others drinking Cokes and eating their pizza of disbelief.
Zero began with the Sumerians who made circles with hollow reeds
in wet clay and baked them for  posterity.
 
At Broadway and Liberty. At 20 floors charred and standing.
At miasma people weeping. Anna's Nail Salon, Daikichi Sushi, 
the vacant shops, stripped clean in the graffiti of dust-coated windows.
 
Something blasted from a boom box in a music store,
something, in the ineffable clips of light,
disappeared over the river."
1405,Warhol / Madison Ave. / 9-11,Peter Balakian,"When I left Eli Zabar the cut-out star on the window
was whirling in the animation of the rich and hungry
hunched over tables for a $30 sandwich and a Diet Coke.
 
It was raining and the blurred glass of the galleries
was the gold leaf of the Carrig Rhone frames—
Childe Hassam’s dabs of Connecticut trees
 
the diaphanous blue on the fleshy rocks,
the melting opal of the shoals.
Inside the Whitney the rain trailed down my face;
 
and I found myself in a quiet corner staring
at the pink face of Marilyn Monroe.
I could still smell the smoldering high-tech plastic
 
as it burned the air. In the whiteness of her teeth,
in the almost aahh of her mouth and the half-drugged eyes
under the lids of teal shadow, the air kept singeing my nose.
 
Against the pale walls Marilyn’s face dissolved
like a stretched mesh and litho ink
where plain form is a place of no desire
 
like the empty mirror of the Hudson at dawn.
In the fissures of her make-up, the planes of color
led back and back behind her teeth longing—
 
to the deception by the Falls on her honeymoon
(with Joseph Cotton in Niagara)—where we found her clothed
and alarmed, and later desperate for the affirmation,
 
of a President’s limp dick and the crisp sheets
the same color of these walls—as my t shirt dries to my skin
and the faintest scent of ground zero
 
sifts down on the walls
whiter than the wingtip vortices
of melting in the morning light."
1406,Agony in the Garden,Peg Boyers,"At supper he whispers something in your ear,
the Judas boy, who wants you.
 
We go to the garden where it’s cool
and wait.
 
From my place against the tree
I see you through the window,
 
watch as you walk from door to desk,
reach into your pocket,
 
pull out your wallet, empty it and leave it by the lamp,
pick up a pen, lean over to write, then don’t,
 
take something heavy from the drawer, put it back
then sweep the money into a paper bag.
 
You walk from desk to door and out, your hand
reaching back to put out the light.
 
On the security film you leave the building
alone, holding the heavy bag.
 
Off camera you walk towards the Charles, leave
your saddle shoes under the pedestrian bridge.
 
We wait in the garden.
And wait.
 
We don’t know yet whom you meet or why.
We don’t know yet that the river has claimed you."
1407,Anonymous Lyric,Connie Voisine,"It was the summer of 1976 when I saw the moon fall down.
 
It broke like a hen’s egg on the sidewalk.
 
The garden roiled with weeds, hummed with gnats who settled clouds on my
 
oblivious siblings.
 
 A great hunger insatiate to find / A dulcet ill, an evil sweetness blind.
 
A gush of yolk and then darker.
 
Somewhere a streetlamp disclosed the insides of a Chevy Impala—vinyl seats, the rear- view,
 
headrests and you, your hand through your hair.
 
 An indistinguishable burning, failing bliss.
 
Because the earth’s core was cooling, all animals felt the urge to wander.
 
Wash down this whisper of you, the terrible must.
 
Maybe the core wasn’t cooling, but I felt a coolness in my mother.
 
That girl was shining me on.
 
In blue crayon, the bug-bitten siblings printed lyrics on the walls of my room.
 
I wrote the word LAVA on my jeans.
 
 It must be the Night Fever, I sang with the 8-track.
 
But the moon had not broken on the sidewalk, the moon
 
was hot, bright as a teakettle whistling outside my door,
 
 tied up in sorrow, lost in my song, if you don’t come back . . .
  
and that serious night cooled, settling like sugar on our lawn.
 
I wrote the word SUGAR on my palms.
 
 I shall say what inordinate love is.
 
The moon rose itself up on its elbows and shook out its long hair."
1408,The Archer,Vicki Hearne,"The sudden thuck of landing
The arrow made in the mark
Of the center lifted and
 
Loosened his skin. And so he
Stood, hearing it like many
Thrusting breaths driven to ground.
 
He abandoned the long light
Flight of arrows and the slow
Parabolas bows dream of
 
For the swifter song beyond
Flesh. Song of moments. The earth
Turned its molten balance.
 
He stood hearing it again:
The precise shudder the arrow
Sought and returned to, flaming."
1409,Back to Country with Pulitzer,Liam Rector,"I left here at eight
And returned at 75.
In between
 
I largely wasted America.
I married, had children,
Distinguished myself in a profession
 
Full of fools, becoming one myself,
As is the way
Of this (or, I suppose, of any other) world.
 
I missed
The Nobel but I did bring down
The Pulitzer. The weather,
 
The politics, the stars,
And my own small contribution
All lined up, and I got one.
 
So “Pulitzer” became my middle name
Before I came here, where no one cares
A whit about such things.
 
I failed at love.
That’s where I truly fucked up.
I couldn’t.
 
The women in this town
Are mostly severe, resentful
—The men bitter, disappointed:
 
A perfect place for my purposes.
I stay in a room
In the house of an old woman
 
Who doesn’t want to have sex any more
And neither do I
So we do not
 
Trouble each other on that front,
Which is good.
I do like to drink.
 
I used to love to eat
But then I don’t much
Give a shit
 
About any of that now.
The old woman sometimes says wistfully
God will soon be calling both of us
 
Back home, but as an agnostic
I don’t believe that.
As an American,
 
I don’t buy that.
I came here to retire from love,
To face my failure to love
 
As I attempted to face everything
Else before, and that
Is exactly what I am doing and doing
 
With the exactness I used to put into
My work, for which I received the Pulitzer.
I hate a coward.
 
My son
Came here the other day and asked
Exactly when I might
 
Be coming back
And I sent him off without an answer.
The answer
 
Seems to be staying here,
Staying honestly here and coming to terms
With my greatest single failure.
 
My wife is dead. To me,
It seems I am left over
To eat a shit sandwich.
 
“Eat me,” the world says,
Now that I have lost my appetite.
We used to say, “Eat me”
To each other in high school,
Another thing from which no one
Ever recovers. America likes to think
 
Every one can recover from every thing,
But about this,
Especially, America is wrong."
1410,Bad People,Mark Halliday,"The guys who drank quarts of Busch last night
here by the backstop of this baseball diamond
had names given them by their mothers and fathers—
“Jack” and “Kenny” let us say.
 
Jack might be
a skinny guy in a black fake-leather jacket,
he’s twenty-five, his gray pants are too loose on his hips,
his jaws always have these little black extra hairs,
his mother won’t talk to him on the phone,
she lives on french fries and ketchup,
he hasn’t been able to send her any cash
in the last two years, ever since he lost
his job unloading produce trucks at Pathmark;
Jack’s father disappeared when he was ten.
“No big deal,” Jack says, “he was a bastard anyway,
he used to flatten beer cans on the top of my head.”
Kenny offers a laugh-noise. He’s heard all that before.
Kenny is forty-eight, a flabby man with reddened skin,
he is employed at the Italian Market selling fish
just four hours a day but his shirts hold the smell;
his female companion Deena left him a note last month:
“You owe me $12 chocolate $31 wine $55 cable TV plus
donuts—I have had it—taking lamp and mirror
they are mine.” Kenny hasn’t seen her since.
He hangs with Jack because Jack talks loud
as if the world of cops and people with full-time jobs
could be kept at bay by talking, talking loud . . .
 
(I’m talking gently and imaginatively here
as if the world of bums and jerks could be kept far off—)
 
Jack and Kenny. (Or two other guys dark to me with wounds
oozing in Philadelphia ways less ready to narrate.)
Last night at midnight they got cheesesteaks at Casseloni’s
and bought four quarts at the Fireside Tavern
and wandered into this park. After one quart of Busch
Jack said he was Lenny Dykstra
and found a stick for his bat. “Pitch to me asshole” he said
so Kenny went to the mound and pitched his bottle
for want of anything better and Jack swung in the dark and missed;
Kenny’s bottle smashed on home plate and Jack heard in the sound
the absurdity of all his desiring since seventh grade,
absurdity of a skinny guy who blew everything since seventh
when he hit home runs and chased Joan Rundle around the gym
so Jack took his own empty bottle and smashed it down
amid the brown shards of Kenny’s bottle.
Then they leaned on the backstop to drink the other two quarts
and they both grew glum and silent
and when they smashed these bottles it was like
what else would they do? Next morning
 
Nick and I come to the park with a rubber ball
and a miniature bat. Nick is not quite three
but he knows the names of all the Phillies starters
and he knows the area around home plate is not supposed to be
covered with jagged pieces of brown glass. Like a good dad
I warn him not to touch it and we decide to establish
a new home plate closer to the mound (there’s no trash can
handy). “Who put that glass there?” Nick wants to know
and to make a long story short I say “Bad People.”
Nick says “Bad? How come?”"
1411,Breakfast with Thom Gunn,Randall Mann,"in memory, 1929-2004

We choose a cheap hotel
because they’re serving drinks.
We drink. I hear him tell
a tale or two: he thinks
 
that so-and-so’s a sleaze;
and then there was the time
that Milosz phoned, oh please.
Another gin with lime?
 
I want to say that once,
I saw him dressed in leather,
leaning on a fence
inside a bar. Rather,
 
walking to the N,
I gush about his books;
he gives his change to men
who’ve lost their homes and looks:
 
how like him, I’ve been told.
Our day together done,
I hug him in the cold.
And then the train is gone."
1412,Buried Life,James Longenbach,"Imagine cities you’ve
Inhabited, streets
Paved in lava stone.
You never intended to pray
 
In the temples, had
Nothing to sell.
Now imagine yourself
 
Returning to those same cities.
Hunt for people you knew,
Knock on their doors.
Ask yourself
 
Where are the vases, animals
Etched in gold?
Where are the wines
 
From distant places,
Banquets ferreted
From the bowels of the earth?
While you were missing
 
Other people wore
Your garments,
Slept in your bed.
 
How frightening
The man who said
In his affliction
 
Wood has hope.
Cut down
It will flourish.
 
If the root grows old
And the trunk withers
In dust, at the scent of water
It will germinate."
1413,The Claim of Speech,Vicki Hearne,"for Stanley Cavell

I
 
Must we mean what we say? Stick to it,
Be bound to, chained up beside the house,
 
Teased by boys on bicycles, fireflies,
The seasons as they pass out of reach?
 
We could try meaning nothing, a way
Favored in the brightest corridors
 
By those who pass from life to death through
Halls of learning and replace marriage
 
With justice. To mean nothing is to
Have nothing at heart, to be chained up
 
To the right of and a bit behind
The body: without marriage, justice
 
Prevails as the clenched hand of culture
On the most brutal bridle prevails
 
Against the motion beneath that wants
To claim the hand of culture. Against
 
The Horse in the horse, the Rider in
The rider, the heart beneath the tongue.
 
 
II
 
In the anarchies of the sensuous
Hands the order of love is leaping.
 
In a far corner of the landscape
A lover’s hands leap in the skin’s light,
 
And heroes’ hands lap like tongues on necks
Curved with significance. The horses
 
Stamp and whinny, hint of caprioles
As urgently as our mute souls
 
And it is impossible to mean
Anything but motion. A dispatch
 
From the graceful landscape will arrive:
“He must be told.” Lovers will obey
 
Thus leaving terror and time alone
To fend for themselves. I will obey,
 
Am obeying now, making poems
From chains, leaving the season alone—
 
 You must be told (already your horse
Leaps beneath you!) what you meant to say."
1414,Divorced Fathers and Pizza Crusts,Mark Halliday,"The connection between divorced fathers and pizza crusts
is understandable. The divorced father does not cook
confidently. He wants his kid to enjoy dinner.
The entire weekend is supposed to be fun. Kids love
pizza. For some reason involving soft warmth and malleability
 
kids approve of melted cheese on pizza
years before they will tolerate cheese in other situations.
So the divorced father takes the kid and the kid's friend
out for pizza. The kids eat much faster than the dad.
Before the dad has finished his second slice,
 
the kids are playing a video game or being Ace Ventura
or blowing spitballs through straws, making this hail
that can't quite be cleaned up. There are four slices left
and the divorced father doesn't want them wasted,
there has been enough waste already; he sits there
 
in his windbreaker finishing the pizza. It's good
except the crust is actually not so great—
after the second slice the crust is basically a chore—
so you leave it. You move on to the next loaded slice.
Finally there you are amid rims of crust.
 
All this is understandable. There's no dark conspiracy.
Meanwhile the kids are having a pretty good time
which is the whole point. So the entire evening makes
clear sense. Now the divorced father gathers
the sauce-stained napkins for the trash and dumps them
 
and dumps the rims of crust which are not
corpses on a battlefield. Understandability
fills the pizza shop so thoroughly there's no room
for anything else. Now he's at the door summoning the kids
and they follow, of course they do, he's a dad."
1415,The Halls,Mark Halliday,"Five more books in a box to be carried out to the car;
your office door closes behind you and at that moment
you turn invisible—not even a ghost in that hall
from the hall’s point of view.
If the halls don’t know you, the halls and the rooms
of the buildings where you worked for seven years—
if the halls don’t know you,
                                                               and they don’t—
some new woman or two new men come clattering
down these halls in the month after your departure, indeed
just two days after you left forever
they come clattering with ideas about
the relation between mind and body or will and fate
filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here
and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them,
accept them, as if there is a belonging in the world—
 
but these new workers are wrong, the halls don’t know
who is working under the unobtrusive fluorescent panels:
 
this is appalling and for a minute you are appalled
though your being so now is not an event
in the life of your new rented house or even
your new condominium . . .
So if they don’t, if they don’t know you,
the halls, the walls, the fixtures,
then what? Then there is for you
no home in that rock, no home in the mere rock of
where you work, where you briskly walk, not even
in the bed where your body sleeps alone or not—
 
so if there is to be a place for you, for you
it must not be located in plaster and tile and space,
it will have to be in that other house,
the one whose door you felt opening just last night
when you dialed from memory and your friend picked up the phone."
1416,Hart Crane Slept Here,Colette Labouff Atkinson,"Each morning, downward, Maria Stella Maris Church glows out the passenger-side window. Further, the corner where the Salvation Army stood and Hart Crane spent the night. At a shore-edge bar, where they'd finally met up, they shared bottles, walked out toward being together, a hotel, and then got rolled. Crane spent the night in the shelter. E., bruised, shipped out the next morning. The hungover poet took the train back toward Altadena. From my car, not much has changed; I see young stevedores shrug off last night's drunk. Past New Dock Street, a cigarette splits, balloons into orange under my wheels. Hot ash. My unkindness is thrown over and over. Door to door, a ride is for what I've squirreled away, not riches but a pile: the ways no thing mattered, how a kiss didn't count, how a friendship could be severed by a coyote walking between us or a dream. My windshield is a tracery. Long ago, down Gaffey, we raced in my hairdresser's sports car. She drove with her knees. Her perfume, the want, filled the heated car. We drove once to her husband's parking lot, switched cars—he'd shipped out for days—and toured in his jeep. But in this home I've chosen, there's a church on every corner and mourners in between. Boys pair up and nothing happens. Girls hold hands. We get rolled. They ship out. Liquor is drained. The train returns to Altadena. Mary, star of the sea, watches over the gem of a filthy port like the hawk, diamond-shaped ahead. She lets me pass five days a week. On my way uphill there are ovals of golden light, then no one home. Shoeless child, chimes, and stevedore off work. Burnt lawn. Hellhole. Haven. Next stop, my house."
1417,Ice Men,James Longenbach,"One cuts blocks
From the abundant river,
Hauls them house to house.
 
One falls, unseen,
The heart
Inoculated cold
 
Against a sky still moving.
Moving even now
Above the river,
The canal.
Willows shimmering
 
Across the water,
Muskrats diving out of reach.
The river whispers
Till it freezes—
 
A body
Twirling sluggishly
Beneath the surface as again
 
One stack, then
Spreads the straw.
 
Another falters,
Slips, or
Puts a sliver on your tongue
To feel it melting there—
The ice-lit
 
Underworld
Of someone else."
1418,January 6,Vicki Hearne,"We must stop bragging. There are limits
For us to the cold and the twelfth night
 
Marks them all. Just off the coast of Maine
The lobster boats pass, dragging their nets.
 
Capsize once in a while, in water
Like that you die, that’s all, that water
 
Isn’t even frozen. Not even
Frozen, and that’s as cold as it gets.
 
The hearts of birds beat voraciously
So they keep warm, so if you put out
 
A feeder, keep it full of the seeds
Their hearts feed on, then it is only
 
When their food runs out that you find them
Inexpressibly taut in hollows,
 
And that’s as cold as it ever gets."
1419,La Tuvería or An Earring’s Lament,Peg Boyers,"En Cuba tuve—
 
I’m tired of hearing your complaints.
All that whining about el exilio, the tragedy of loss,
 
 In Cuba I had—
 
the catalogue of things, the status, the riches,
the opulence of it all.
 
 I had a mate. We were a pair. Our mistress was young. We
 were young. We would dangle on her ear
 
Concentrate on what you have.
Forget the past.
 
 and go out on the town. Mojitos at La Floridita,
 dancing at the Tropicana and later
 
No, don’t tell me about later.
 
 in the jewel case, an aqua Tiffany box
 with white satin interior, we
 
Tiffany’s? From New York? I didn’t know you—
 
 would lie together in the pillowy luxury,
 my ruby top layer and his aligned, our bases
 
Please you needn’t—
 
 touching, my diamond waist and his forming a continuous
 line. Sometimes we would switch backs, I’d push
 
I understand that in communities of exile
the population
 
 my piercing needle through his back, his
 through mine. That’s
 
tends to lose ground politically as
assimilation takes place, that
 
 how I liked it best, a little harsh, but sweet.
 Tu y yo, you and I, is what she called us because our very
 
longing is a constitutive ingredient
of not only the condition of exile but—
 
 body parts were paired, he and I, forming a single unit, an I and a
 thou. Apart
 
Surely you have adjusted. Look, you’re mounted on a ring, you
are independent, and prized. Very attractive for your age, I might add.
 
 we are nothing. Longing doesn’t quite—
 
One adapts?
 
 As to an amputation.
 
And La Revolución?
 
 Don’t make me vomit."
1420,Mean,Colette Labouff Atkinson,"Wife two was a stripper. And sweet, as well. He traded her in for me. To people I don't know, I say she was a dancer. I watch them, puzzled, wonder how anyone could not love a ballerina. And you have to question a guy like that: trading in a sweet stripper for me. Not a homemaker. Not home much at all. Not sweet. More like my grandfather, Jimmy Grieco. Mean. My mother likes to describe the blue-sky day when she bought me a helium balloon and I let it go. I was six. I begged for another. She said, okay, but, if you let this one go, I’m really going to be mad. I nodded, took the string in my hand, held tight, and then opened my hand flat so the balloon lifted and its string slipped up and away. You were never sweet, my mother says.

 

***

In Vegas, a few weeks ago, Jimmy and I sorted photographs in his double-wide just off Boulder Highway. My mother stood on the sidelines. She hates how I ask Jimmy for the hard stories. Tell me about the moonshine. Tell me about the dead kids. Tell me how your mother saved the family by burning down the farm. Jimmy’s crooked finger points to a picture of the family. That was Leonard. He was deaf and dumb. Died at twelve. That was Vincent. The baby who fell off the staircase without a rail. Dead at two. Then there's his mother, surrounded by her children. She was tough, he says. Tough. When Chicago’s Black Hand demanded ten thousand dollars, she stuffed five grand in her apron, grabbed my grandfather—then five—and took him to deliver the money. That's all you'll ever get, she said, and don’t touch my kids or I’ll kill you.

 

***

My grandfather never asks about the first or second wife. I don’t have to tell him that ballerina-fable. He knows I’m three and mean. He knows it for his whole life. His first, my grandmother, was like sugar. He burned her, abandoned her in LA, raced to Mexico, paved road turning to dirt; he ate prickly pear, maybe, on the way to his quick divorce. And, though he won’t tell this story, his own father lived, first, with a sweet woman on a wheat farm, far south in Craco, Italy. He boarded a ship, told his wife he’d send for her, and then fled to New York. And in an apartment on Mulberry Street, he met up with the new girlfriend and they disappeared into their new world. She wasn’t pretty. She was tough. She got busted twice for making moonshine. Her sons loved her. She was mean."
1421,Mental Mommy,Liam Rector,"Home from school at six years old, first grade,
And uncle there to tell me Mommy
Gone, Mommy not be coming back any
 
Time soon, Liam, Mommy had to go to
Mental hospital. Nervous breakdown.
Years later Mommy, when she gets out
 
Of mental, often says, “If you’re
A bad boy for me Liam you’re
Going to send me back, back
 
Into mental hospital, like you did
First time.” At 13
I find out Mom had been doing years
 
In a federal prison all that time,
For stealing, so no mental hospital for
Mommy. Breakdown ours alone.
 
I was on my own."
1422,The Missing Poem,Mark Halliday,"It would have been dark but not lugubrious. It would have been
fairly short but not slight. It would have contained a child
saying something inadvertently funny that was not said by my daughter,
something strangely like what your daughter or sister said once
if you could remember. The child's voice flies across
a small parking lot where, in one of the cars,
a man and a woman sit listening to the silence between them.
The child's voice probably hurts them momentarily
with a sense of beauty apparently very possible
yet somehow out of reach. In the missing poem this is
implied, conveyed, transmitted without being flatly said.
And it does a dissolve into the look of a soccer field
after a game—the last three or four players walk
slowly away, their shin-guards muddy, their cleats caked,
one player dragging a net bag full of soccer balls—
the players seem to have known what it was all for
yet now they look somehow depleted and aimless there
at the field's far end; and a block away on a wood-grainy porch
the eyes of a thin woman sixty-three years old search the shadows
in each passing car, as the poem recalls what she wants to recall.
Hours later the field is dark
 
and the hills are dark and later even Firehouse Pizza has closed.
In the missing poem all this pools into a sense of how much
we must cherish life; the world will not do it for us.
This idea, though, in the missing poem is not smarmy.
Remember when you got the news of the accident—
or the illness—in the life of someone
more laced into your life than you might have thought;
the cool flash of what serious is. Well,
the missing poem brings that. Meanwhile not seeming like
an imitation of Mark Strand or Mark Doty or Mark Jarman!
Yet not like just another Halliday thing either.
Instead it would feel like a new dimension of the world,
the real world we imagine. With lightness!
With weight and lightness and, on the hypothetical radio,
that certain song you almost forgot to love."
1423,The Mortician in San Francisco,Randall Mann,"This may sound queer,
but in 1985 I held the delicate hands
of Dan White:
I prepared him for burial; by then, Harvey Milk
was made monument—no, myth—by the years
since he was shot.
 
I remember when Harvey was shot:
twenty, and I knew I was queer.
Those were the years,
Levi’s and leather jackets holding hands
on Castro Street, cheering for Harvey Milk—
elected on the same day as Dan White.
 
I often wonder about Supervisor White,
who fatally shot
Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk,
who was one of us, a Castro queer.
May 21, 1979: a jury hands
down the sentence, seven years—
 
in truth, five years—
for ex-cop, ex-fireman Dan White,
for the blood on his hands;
when he confessed that he had shot
the mayor and the queer,
a few men in blue cheered. And Harvey Milk?
 
Why cry over spilled milk,
some wondered, semi-privately, for years—
it meant “one less queer.”
The jurors turned to White.
If just the mayor had been shot,
Dan might have had trouble on his hands—
 
but the twelve who held his life in their hands
maybe didn’t mind the death of Harvey Milk;
maybe, the second murder offered him a shot
at serving only a few years.
In the end, he committed suicide, this Dan White.
And he was made presentable by a queer."
1424,"Pasco, Barbara",Mark Halliday,"I find I am descending in a propeller plane upon Pasco
in the state of Washington. I accept this;
I have reasons for participating in the experiential sequence
that has brought me here. Down below the land is printed
with huge circles, doubtless an irrigation system,
doubtless it makes sense. There are people who understand it
living with dignity in square houses
and the result possibly is one billion radishes.
Now some so-called time has passed. This nation
is a huge nation in which the infinity of for example
Washington State
is just one segment of an even less thinkable hugeness
and yet zim zim zim zim United Airlines has me
here in my Eastern metropolis
with its ten thousand makers of third-rate pizza
uncannily far from the possible radishes of Washington State.
The taxi driver experiments with narrow streets
to shorten our detour caused by sports fans and he says
the Eagles will out-tough the Steelers.
I defer to his judgment, I am conserving my powers.
After “a while” I have this unsettlingly smooth tuna salad
with a pale pickle
in a drugstore designed by Dwight D. Eisenhower,
reading a few poems by David Rivard. I have thoughts.
I have my Uncle Ralph’s jacket soft and droopy giving me
a Sense of the Past. The rain out there
on the roofs of retail outlets is saying No Guarantee
and in a way I am nowhere, in another way maybe
definitely not. In a wide wet parking lot
I turn back toward the store to explain to the cashier
that she charged me for six cans of seltzer when in fact
I only had one from a six-pack
but the idea of justice seems so fatiguing
I would rather read a surprisingly serious detective novel
so I vibrate with indecision in the parking lot
till all the car windows rattle imperceptibly. Then
an alleged interval ostensibly intervenes, at the mall
a woman at a piano has played 1800 songs from memory
according to the radio personality who stands with a mike
explaining her bid for the Guinness Book of Records.
I am walking away at an unplanned angle singing “Tiny Montgomery”
which I bet she wouldn’t have been ready to play.
I have this inner life, I think of my father
lonely in Vermont, I think of myself lonely in Syracuse
and my old poem about a detective who can’t solve his biggest case
and as a result I have feelings—but my teacher said
the future of American poetry can’t be merely
the notation of sensibility. When he said that I felt
a chilly fear at the edge of consc-consc-consc-consciousness
like an ice cube in the corner of my stomach.
That’s how I felt. So then, so then consequently
I thought “I must gather up some serious ideas” but then
Ashberry phoned and left a message after the beep.
“Don’t be a sucker, ideas are where it isn’t.”
This made my throat get sort of dry so I drank a Classic Coke
and then another Classic Coke two hours later
as time so-to-say passed. What was always there?
Texture, that’s what, how it was/is, the how of how;
when I pick up my color prints at the camera shop
the disappointment I always feel is actually a blessing
is it not? I can say “I’ll go along with this charade
until I can think my way out” even though I’ll never
think my way out. I’ve come this far;
that day in 1971 I hitchhiked all the way to Montpelier
didn’t I? And here I am.
Suddenly I have a son
who focuses with tremendous insistence upon
dogs, balloons, air conditioners, hats, clocks, and noses.
To him I convey that the world is okay:
life is good: we accept it. Your dad is a little mixed up
but your shoes got tied, right?
As Barbara Cohen in high school said about politics
it’s interesting, giving the word four earnest syllables,
in-ter-est-ing."
1425,Passing Over Your Virtues,Vicki Hearne,"To pass over in silence
Is to acknowledge logic,
The necessity of form,
 
The stunning curve of language,
The curious way it seems
To turn out that “love” means “need”
 
Even in a lush garden.
To pass over the Red Sea
Or your bounty—so long as
 
True silence and not some tense
Paralysis of the false
Is achieved—then Passover
 
Is always a charity,
The painted fish in the blue
Water turns to their own colors.
 
To pass over in silence
Is to acknowledge you if
This chatter dissolve as it
 
Will in the marvelous sky."
1426,"""Perhaps this verse would please you better—Sue—(2)""",Colette Labouff Atkinson,"Before boys, Susan drove me to work, for teriyaki takeout on Manchester past Lincoln Boulevard. Inseparable, we planned winter and Easter vacations. In the stairwell, I tried to talk. She cut me off. Her echo was loud when she said you can’t see yourself. We went to see Purple Rain. That fall, I had dinner with a boy. Susan was angry and told me I was wrong. I felt it was true. Was it that boy? That he had once dated someone Susan knew? We stopped talking. We were eighteen. A decade later, I turned a corner coming out of a bookstore and heard Susan laugh. I know that, I thought, remembering how she’d saved me from saying who I was. I circled back. She answered as she had before we fell out. She answered with shame. Do you remember how things ended, she asked, because of boys?"
1427,Playa Colorada,Peg Boyers,"It was a beach
like all beaches, only perhaps more beautiful.
And the sand was pink not red.
 
We would arrive in caravans,
hampers overflowing with food and drink
like Aziz and his party on the way to Malabar.
 
The colonials and their servants away on an outing.
We would stop under thatch umbrellas,
towels and tablecloths spread out against the sea.
 
My mother in her skirted swim suit
surrounded by fathers of other children,
her olive skin lit through her straw hat.
 
They would laugh and drink beer
and leer
while the children did the usual beach things,
 
boring futile tunnels to China, running
at waves and then away,
daring each other to be swallowed.
 
I would go out by the forbidden rocks and pick off oysters,
then give them to the men to pry open,
cover with lime juice and suck dry.
 
Once, I saw my mother sucking
an oyster out of another daddy’s hand.
Her dappled face bobbed and smiled and her tongue
 
searched the shell for pearls."
1428,Poetry Failure,Mark Halliday,"For example, I wrote my first poem in 1976 about being in the Vermont house
after my mother’s death; she died the year before;
she loved that house. My father said he kept having moments
of thinking she must have just stepped outside for a minute
to weed the garden or to walk just a little way
along Prospect Street, for a few minutes only and now
almost now she’d be coming back, we’d hear the screen door,
Bev would be back and saying something casual about—
 
about the cats, Daphne and Chloe, or about Mrs. Yamokofsky next door
or about the pear tree, “or a colored stone she found.”
That was the phrase that ended my poem in 1976:
“or a colored stone she found.” The phrase rang slightly false
but I wanted it—the “ound” and “one” sounds sounded profound
and in 1976 “stone” was still a word guaranteed poetic.
But did my mother ever pick up colorful stones?
Wasn’t that more something I did fifteen years earlier?
In the poem I was trying to turn my ironic mother into
an ideal figure certified sweet like a child.
 
But what could I make her say? Something very sly and wry?
The poetry would be in her voice, the way of her voice being
hers—voice of my mother—whether the words were about
the cats or Mrs. Yamokofsky or potatoes to peel for mashing.
Not your mother. My mother. Poetry of her
saying in her Bev way “those potatoes” or “Mrs. Yamokovsky”
or “Daphne’s gone down by the Black River
but if we feed Chloe I’m sure she’ll be back.”
And my father and Kimbo and me just going “Yeah” or “In a minute”
because this was all just life."
1429,Politics,Randall Mann,"This is what he dreams of:
a map of burned land,
a mound of dirt
in the early century’s winter.
 
A map of burned land?
A country is razed
in the early century’s winter.
And God descends.
 
A country is raised
because of industry.
And God descends,
messengers rush inside
 
because of industry,
in spite of diplomats.
Messengers rush inside
to haunt the darkened aisles.
 
In spite of diplomats,
the witnesses know well
to haunt the darkened aisles,
experimentally—
 
the witnesses know well
that ushers dressed in black
experimentally
lurk by the cushioned seats.
 
That ushers dress in black
should tell you something:
lurking by the cushioned seats,
the saved and the terrible.
 
I should tell you something:
this is what he dreams of,
the saved and the terrible—
a mound of dirt."
1430,Queen Christina,Randall Mann,"To celebrate his final Pride, in June,
my friend, lymphatic, thin, and in distress,
managed to dress in drag. He shot the moon:
outstretched, he’d used his dying to think—obsess—
 
about the Prada pumps, their skin a snake;
the heavy pantyhose, two pair; the moot
but lacy underthings; the makeup, cake,
to overlay his pain. I called him beaut-
 
 i-ful; he said he felt like Greta Garbo
in Queen Christina (our campy interplay);
I countered that he looked more like a hobo-
sexual in heels. We howled. That day,
 
we never left his Castro flat. His rhinestone
glittered, and everywhere, the smell of cologne."
1431,Second Life,James Longenbach,"Accompanied
To the Campi Flegrei
By a shadow,
 
She listened to voices rise
From the darkness,
Then recede.
 
Instruments
Sustained them.
When one had finished
 
Others played.
False proportions
Sung boldly.
 
Rain on the roof tiles.
 O selve, o campi."
1432,Soon the City,Liam Rector,"Soon the summer
Now the pleasant purgatory
Of spring is over,
 
Soon the choking
Humidity
In the city
 
On the fire escapes
In a sleeveless T-shirt
Smoking a cigar
 
In tune with the tremor
Of the mindless yellow
Commercial traffic
 
Moving in the city,
Where no one really
Buys a car,
 
American
Or otherwise,
Where we will,
 
As Rilke said we would
Where we will
Wake, read, write
 
Long letters
And in the avenues
Wander restlessly
 
To and fro
On foot in
The humidity,
 
Where soon I’ll shower, dress,
Take the dog out for a piss,
And mail this."
1433,Time in a Brown House,Mark Halliday,"Sam paused on the stairs. He had forgotten a thing.
In Leland’s room a copy of Thomas Merton lay on the floor.
The air was full of gnats of possibility. What was the story?
Sam looked at the clock twice. The day was dropping
softly away while Sam’s sneakers made the wood stairs creak.
The wood was sure it was wood. Alice got home from the store.
The bags had to be unloaded as the day went and went.
Then the sundown kitchen grew quiet.
Sam crossed his legs one way, then the other way. He had chosen
purple corduroys. They were pants of the day; one possibility.
On the tilted table sat the damaged typewriter.
What about Thomas Merton? Did he know the central story?
Someone was quietly reading by the fireplace but not Sam.
Next day there was badminton with the troubled carpenter
and the story of an awful egg salad, causing laughter;
but Sam had forgotten some thing. Then Alice brought in
the brownies and minor pleasure colored the house
 
and there went the evening. J.J. came downstairs
all gleamy from her bath. She had three reasons to get downtown fast.
Sam picked up a novel by Sukenick. The clue must be nearby.
Between Sam and the page swarmed the gnats of possibility.
Leland stowed his bicycle in the basement and came upstairs
with a point about capitalism. Look at the time said someone.
Where was J.J. now? Where was the story? Under the red chair
lay the newspaper whose relevance was all mystery or
not mystery enough. Then Alice went out to see a movie.
Some man meets some woman with big eyes on a jet
and changes his whole life for her, disastrously but thrillingly.
Alice told about it briefly, and went to make tea. Sam paused
on the hard wooden stairs. J.J. was gone. She was gone.
Leland was eating yogurt at midnight. The whole brown house
was floating, gliding very smoothly for some reason
with Sam not clear whether the gliding was a story
and if so was it central and was it his?"
1434,"To Ireland, To Bethlehem",Connie Voisine,"The plane is packed and over sweaty heads,
                         rumpled hair, the movie glows in the transatlantic nighttime
            murmur of priests and nuns and Riverdancers returning
 
home—a baby is cooed by an older mother, a boy feels
                          for his seat in the dark. I’ve read my books
            already, 2 days traveling, the difficulties
 
technical. I hate that money, says the priest beside me,
                           and he orders another scotch, his third.
            The Feast of the Epiphany tomorrow, he studies religious 
 
journals for a message, writes in a notebook
                            impossibly small. We are having problems
             with sound, the flight attendant announces,
 
 it is not your headset, and so the oceans swell in silence,
                            bright blue tumbles across the screen mutely, foam
            collapsing over a tiny nimble figure
 
but she darts through to a green glow,
                            sunshine through a veil of wave, her surfboard tense between
            her feet and the world’s largest ocean. Her ride
 
is long, impossibly long—her hips stay low, a friend
                              drops onto her wave and, together, they glide towards the shore.
             No music. Just water and that blue. I check the SkyMall catalogue
 
for something I might need and didn’t know. There are
                              reasons I am flying over the ocean, reasons I
              I wish I were sure of. Someday I might say, yes, I chose
 
 him, and it wasn’t wise. Or maybe we’ll be old and
                          surrounded by our own. The screen flashes;
              the surf is wild, but the bright sky makes me whisper,
 
 Hawaii, where nothing could be that beautiful
                          but is. The waves are bigger and she sets out, flowered
               bikini, hair pulled back in a serious bun.
 
But too soon she’s underwater, arms above her head,
                           spinning down into a champagne sea.
              The priest asks would I like some English chocolate. I say no
  
at first then say yes. I say,
                             how many Euros for the scotch? The baby Jesus
               is about to be adored by black men, foreign kings, in
 
fact, tomorrow. They’re stumbling, the Magi,
                         12 days across an ocean and through the desert.
                It’s hot so they must travel at night—
 
who wouldn’t? And there was that star, sudden and perhaps a sign.
                           We’ve already tried to get there once,
                I want to say to the kings. It’s cool in this 747,
 
which later the pilot will land with only one engine.
                          A problem with
                compressors. But what a sweet,
 
sweet ocean, and those few younger girls
                         who try to ride it. And what a night,
                warmed by the sun-shocked smell
 
of saddle and sweat, the strong breath of camels.
                          What carved, fragrant trunkfuls
                born across deserts and ready to be opened before an infant god."
1435,Air,Don Bogen,"Air as lost time
Voice of a cloud, of a ghost crowned with nimbus
Smack-thin, it lingers forty years
I thought it came from the jeweled world we’d seen
Everything stuffed, urgent, glittering alive
But it was just pleasure, blank and sure
Now what is there to sing
From speakers, the tune folds and fades in waves
Earphones drive it through your head"
1436,American Incognito,David Gewanter,"But to whatever animal we ascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in America, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence. . . .

I called for armour, rose, and did not reel.
But when I thought . . .

 THE STATES
 
For he can creep.
 
Whose doctor said his bipolar was pre-existing.
Smacked in the head by a steel cargo door,
hinges tied with a hamburger bag.
The day he blew up: a sucking silence, mouth of tar,
     story told over and over.
 
bump and rattle, caissons rolling.
The blacked-out school bus window is
scratched to read GHOST RECON. Street signs flash by,
“This here is Georgia. Now I see New Hampshire,
     and here’s Colorado.” What country is this city?
 
Gorked on pain-relief cocktails, Iraq to Landstuhl Med
to Andrews Air Force, wheelchair bus to Walter Reed.
Wounded when burning poppies, now afloat
on morphine. “As a state,” he once emailed,
     “Afghanistan is next to Mars.”
 
The navigator slides along a wall:
“Sir, can you show me north?”

CONSTITUTION AVE, CAPITALSAURUS DAY
 
Beneath the marble, beneath the paper laws;
the paved boglands and legs-up taverns,
the slave-built steps of the Capitol. Winter 1898,
a sewer-man digs up a dinosaur spine,
      a nomen nudum, naked & unnamed fossil
 
tombed later at the Smithsonian
near Jefferson’s Mammoth tooth
that rattled his pocket, cherished knuckle-bone
and proof against the French naturalist
      who with powdered hands
 
wrote that New World dampness and cold
had stunted flora, animals, and Man:
the American Degeneracy. 
Jefferson ordered Lewis & Clark to find
      a living Mammoth,
 
the “animal de l’Ohio”
grazing somewhere west
of Big Bone Lick, Kentucky, and—
lest a species wither, or Nation grow small—
      brought Mammoth bones to Monticello.
 
“WHEREAS, the remains of a large carnivorous dinosaur,
which may be an ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex,
were found at First and ‘F’ Streets, SE,
 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, MAYOR OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA, do hereby proclaim January 28, 2001,
as ‘CAPITALSAURUS DAY.’”
 
Anthony A. Williams
 
 
DISCOVERY IN SIBERIA
 
Reindeer of the herdsman Jarkov nuzzle
a tusk frozen 20,000 years. Soon,
French naturalists arrive. Radar shows
the Holy Grail of Mammoth hunters,
      a frigid bulk, twice an elephant’s size—
 
Timber saws cut the block. Hoisted by
military helicopter to Stalin’s
gulag caves, frozen labs for scientist-prisoners,
now re-opened. Waving hair-dryers
      to sublimate the ice, so that Discovery
 
can film them planting clone eggs
inside an elephant, hatching a Mammoth
American defender to split the ramparts,
show scheduled for release in 2001
      —the year, in the sci-fi film,
 
the monkeys learn to talk;
when Mayor Williams greets      
the Capitalsaurus and the new President Bush;
when Mohammed Atta decides he
      cannot date a waitress.
 
 
SECURITAS
 
Weary headlands roll through zones of night,
red lights flash the muted streets,
crotch-of-moss draining a blue spark dawn—
We sleep, staring. Tree-shapes and stars prod us,
      the belt of Orion is a martyr’s bomb.
 
And the king, our godsbody, lies abed
groaning, chill spirit belaboring the flesh—
His spit and sperm are tallied; his temperature,
a weather report told by doctors. Until
      lady Securitas peers from a cloud—
 
her bloodlined hands, the blank, bureaucratic face!
We pray with our bodies: cold sweat, a hymn
of twitches, heart racing, shrieking dreams . . .
But fragrant Securitas has only
       come for him—
 
To compass him about.
Lifting out her breast.
Stoppers his mouth with a thick nipple.
Squeezing till the ichor throbs from his eyes,
      milk to make us thirsty—
 
 
IRAQ & TEXAS: DJINN ROADS
 
 Helicopters park at Forward Base EXXON;
 only the sand is flying today, and it breaks
 the speed limits, 50 miles an hour. Visibility zero;
 the air is hot as blood, the sky is burnt amber.
      Lord keep still our hands.
 
In Texas, teens patrol the roads by night,
burning the body’s fuel—State Troopers pull them over.
George, fishtailing dauphin, a graceful
falldown drunk, clouds the breathalyzer:
      FELONY DUI. Daddy’s name sinks the report—
 
Election night, heaven staring, and Laura’s
yellowcake Chevy mows down her boyfriend:
VEHICULAR HOMICIDE: the car found guilty.
“I know this as an adult, it was crushing,”
      she recalls. Her scented, unmarked body
 
sweats beneath foundation garments and paste.
His unmarked body, and fructifying breath,
his stone squint chasing snakes from the sun—
They walk, O my darling, the hill of light;
      the bite of remorse teaches them to bite.
 
 Then it rains. What falls from the sky is not water
 but mud, raindrops pulling clouds of sand
 into large wet globs. “It was biblical,” says
 Col. Gibbs. Lights a cigarette, his back to the storm:
       “You’ve got to embrace the suck.”
 
 
HOTEL AFTERMATH
 
 From the dust, the limbs jerk up alive, stagger home
 to camp. Martian: neck gators for the nose, goggles
 seal off the eyes, baby wipes. WHAT DID YOU FIND THERE?
 A slipper, an ear, some wire. A chemical suit.
       A map of water.
            ——
 
From Stalin’s cave, just bits of gristle—unreadable,
no Frankenstein DNA. They rewrite the Mammoth show.
 
From Walter Reed, “an aggressive campaign
to deal with the mice infestation.”
      Recovery rooms, “spit-polish clean.”
 
Whose mother swallows all the soldier medicine.
 
Who wheels himself in to play Texas Hold ‘Em.
 
Whose father says, “It was OK for my son
to give his body. They try in their power,
      but it reverses itself.”
 
Jefferson’s American Incognito
is ground up for fertilizer—
the maid said it was cow bones. Sweet heartland,
Governor Meriwether Lewis
      of Louisiana, depression pre-existing,
 
shoots himself in the chest and head.
 
Who sit by the apples and wingback chairs.
“If I had two hands, I’d order two vodkas”—
 
Who cannot count his change.
      Who wake up and punch the air."
1437,Give It Back,Don Bogen,"Give it back—I made it all up
That alcove where surplus glowed under dust
Unfinished, an attic space with nails poking down
Khaki of sheet metal, orange flickering in tubes
Ephemeral as the smells, which were plywood, solder, and Kents
Color words, smell words—I put them in a book
Everything there is still missing
Two lies of remembrance: it was always winter
Things could speak"
1438,In a Restless World Like This Is,Charles Bernstein,"Not long ago, or maybe I dreamt it
Or made it up, or have suddenly lost
Track of its train in the hocus pocus
Of the dissolving days; no, if I bend
The turn around the corner, come at it
From all three sides at once, or bounce the ball
Against all manner of bleary-eyed fortune
Tellers—well, you can see for yourselves there’s
Nothing up my sleeves, or notice even
Rocks occasionally break if enough
Pressure is applied. As far as you go
In one direction, all the further you’ll
Have to go on before the way back has
Become totally indivisible."
1439,Möbius,David Gewanter,"for R.G.

As if sliding down the green, scuffed face
      of the wave, a seaplane falls
and turns together, keeping the waters of
 
the ear flat: a dead calm. But when the window’s
      frowning strip of shoreline,
the battalions of tropical-drinks umbrellas
 
guarding the sandcastles and saltboxes
      of the rich,
when these flip upside down, and the pale
 
clouded sky floats below the ocean,
      then we jolt awake—
But this is not her dream, not water or land.
 
       Tell me again, what illness do I think I have?
 
The ropes of blood coil through her neck,
      they twist as it twists,
as the head looks for parents and young men,
 
for nurses, strangers, year upon year attending
      until the pulpy blood
knots up at last, and the warrens of
 
the brain dry and crackle, a town of names
      she saunters one long night:
streets without signs lead to a girlhood park,
 
to songs under stars, and lipstick,
      old houses forever
unbuilding themselves—but within the blue
 
jungle scaffolding, a gallery of faces
      stares back at her,
portraits she can’t place . . . and then the town
 
flattens and crumbles behind her, it grows
      to dry scrabbled pasture
under a dishplate moon, hanging there
 
in the tints of the sky, yet like a stopped
      clock, right twice a day:
 
       Now ma’am, can you remember the name of
       the President who was shot in the ‘60s?
 
       —Lincoln?
 
And if the names had sunk beneath the sea,
      rolling hump and hollow,
leopard spotted foam—surgeons would haul up
 
the big sharks and club them silly, knife off a fin,
      then drop them
bleeding onto the docks of Alcatraz,
 
warning the inmates: “See that?
      No inside fin,
they’ll  swim round this Rock forever. . . .”
 
The convicts build the prison, then move inside,
      their block minds
ignite a thousand homes by dawn,
 
then melt in the butter sun of
      breakfast porridge. . . .
But this is not the Philosopher’s circle prison,
 
no lidless Eye radiates from the center,
      beneficent
and watchful: the neutered grounds
 
here at the Residence for Life
      are groomed
like the campus of Depression State U:
 
past the dwarfish berms and drumlins
      a mazy cobalt
walkway slithers to the storage lake,
 
with its hooded fount of aqua vitae sudsing
      the green larvae,
its dry Gazebo Isle no one shuffles to . . .
 
One night, the distraught Residence cook
      shoots himself dead:
everyone mourns, but only the young staff
 
seek counseling, their threshold of death
      not yet raised
to that of teetering Mr. On-His-Toes,
 
of Ms. Wheelchair-With-Political-Bumper-Stickers,
      or elegant
Mrs. Whisper, polite confused survivors of
 
wiped-out families, trolley cars, jobs learned
      and lost, a cosmos
squeezed beneath the blood boulder—
 
      Why can’t I remember my problem?
 
They do not scream. They who once
      made things happen
now watch things happen to them:
 
they hand their middle chapters to
      their children,
and quietly appraise the spindle of
 
a leafless sapling outside, staked
      to three larger
poles of wood: all of them under arrest.
 
And you must calm yourself. In the acrid hold
      of their boat,
whose strangely knotted sail whips the wind
 
round on each side, anchorless boat
      that hugs the dock,
and keeps the dock from drifting to sea,
 
you can hear the first, reeling chapters,
      of pierside painters
crowding a rustic barrel-and-shanty scene
 
so clichéd the locals called it “Port Motif
      Number One”—:
the washy dab and smear of the medical test,
     
      Can you tell me what day this is?
       
       —You mean now?
 
The brush like an oar rinses off its paints;
      a filmy rainbow
upon the waters, coils and ribbons
 
you trace in your own sweet time."
1440,Phrases,Arthur Rimbaud,"When the world is reduced to a single dark wood for our two pairs of dazzled eyes
—
to a beach for two faithful children
—
to a musical house for our clear understanding
—
then I shall find you.

      When there is only one old man on earth, lonely, peaceful, handsome, living in unsurpassed luxury, then I am at your feet.

      When I have realized all your memories, —when I am the girl who can tie your hands,—then I will stifle you.

 

 

      When we are very strong, who draws back? or very happy, who collapses from ridicule? When we are very bad, what can they do to us.

      Dress up, dance, laugh. I will never be able to throw Love out of the window.

1442,River,Greg Miller,"A loon dives in the swollen river.
It followed the river first.
The town lies between it and canals
Diverted from the river.
The beak of the loon is orange,
Its wingspan broader than a duck’s.
 
My father’s legs were swollen.
His once thin ankles barely fit his shoes.
His heart no longer fed his body.
Toxins and liquids began to drown him.
His silly doctors didn’t see
He couldn’t breathe.
 
My father took me to the river.
We fished for bass and bluegill,
Sunfish, cats. Fat suckers,
Their lips like suction cups,
We put back. Too many little bones
To catch and make you choke.
 
I no longer want to go fishing.
I don’t even want to play
In the water. The boat
Here has no oars, the current
Is too swift. In the dark, teenagers
Discover their body together.
 
The body feels like a prison.
I kneel by my father’s stapled body.
He suctions thick liquid from his lungs.
He coughs to clear them; it hurts.
He wants more air. He wants
To live, the heart’s valve's parachutes
 
Opening with oxygen to feed
The body’s healing. A tube
Empties the chest cavity. He excretes
Liquids and poisons.
His shocked kidneys come to life.
His stunned heart beats. His lung
 
Opens again. He eats. He poops.
He walks. He wants to go home.
On the phone, I catch my sister
Taking him home. It’s snowing.
It’s cold. My brother and mother
Help him climb the stairs.
 
I walk down the path
By the shallow canal. I see
A falcon fishing. The power plant
Breathes steam. I hope
The wind won’t singe me.
I come to the falls
 
Where a little dog
Barks and bounces hello. His owner
Smiles and greets me. In the church
Of Saint Laurence I kneel, I
Give thanks, my heart jumps."

School, a door closing

Shut off,
not my past,

1444,Watch,Greg Miller,"We pass the straits of the Cape
where grazing whales gather,
though they’re not, I’m told, social
creatures by nature.
 
Alice asks how they can sleep
if they must think to breathe.
Cranial hemispheres wink and wake
and alternate,
 
so whales are half-awake
and half-asleep, balanced between each
of our states
through dive and breach.
 
Once on the kitchen wall
of a dune shack I saw,
like a headdress,
the baleen of a whale—
 
frayed filaments
run from a thin,
curled, rib-like bone:
sieves for the sea.
 
Like this sickle-moon fin
“negatively buoyant”
I sink in sleep,
but end, I think, where I begin.
 
Following one as it leaves
two other whales we see
suddenly not what we’re heading for
but the asymmetrically
 
colored snout of a fin whale
as it rises parallel
within a stone’s
throw of the boat,
 
the great eye set back
water crashing rushing
to let me see where it ought to be.
I lose track,
 
the mottled chin’s marble
veined, swirling
through its green veil, which
the top jaw slits.
 
And then, that’s it,
I think. Nights I’m thrown
upright from my rest. Brine
thumps my chest."
1445,The Drunken Boat,Arthur Rimbaud,"As I was going down impassive Rivers,
I no longer felt myself guided by haulers:
Yelping redskins had taken them as targets
And had nailed them naked to colored stakes.
 
I was indifferent to all crews,
The bearer of Flemish wheat or English cottons
When with my haulers this uproar stopped
The Rivers let me go where I wanted.
 
Into the furious lashing of the tides
More heedless than children's brains the other winter
I ran! And loosened Peninsulas
Have not undergone a more triumphant hubbub
 
The storm blessed my sea vigils
Lighter than a cork I danced on the waves
That are called eternal rollers of victims,
Ten nights, without missing the stupid eye of the lighthouses!
 
Sweeter than the flesh of hard apples is to children
The green water penetrated my hull of fir
And washed me of spots of blue wine
And vomit, scattering rudder and grappling-hook
 
And from then on I bathed in the Poem
Of the Sea, infused with stars and lactescent,
Devouring the azure verses; where, like a pale elated
Piece of flotsam, a pensive drowned figure sometimes sinks;
 
Where, suddenly dyeing the blueness, delirium
And slow rhythms under the streaking of daylight,
Stronger than alcohol, vaster than our lyres,
The bitter redness of love ferments!
 
I know the skies bursting with lightning, and the waterspouts
And the surf and the currents; I know the evening,
And dawn as exalted as a flock of doves
And at times I have seen what man thought he saw!
 
I have seen the low sun spotted with mystic horrors,
Lighting up, with long violet clots,
Resembling actors of very ancient dramas,
The waves rolling far off their quivering of shutters!
 
I have dreamed of the green night with dazzled snows
A kiss slowly rising to the eyes of the sea,
The circulation of unknown saps,
And the yellow and blue awakening of singing phosphorous!
 
I followed during pregnant months the swell,
Like hysterical cows, in its assault on the reefs,
Without dreaming that the luminous feet of the Marys
Could constrain the snout of the wheezing Oceans!
 
I struck against, you know, unbelievable Floridas
Mingling with flowers panthers' eyes and human
Skin! Rainbows stretched like bridal reins
Under the horizon of the seas to greenish herds!
 
I have seen enormous swamps ferment, fish-traps
Where a whole Leviathan rots in the rushes!
Avalanches of water in the midst of a calm,
And the distances cataracting toward the abyss!
 
Glaciers, suns of silver, nacreous waves, skies of embers!
Hideous strands at the end of brown gulfs
Where giant serpents devoured by bedbugs
Fall down from gnarled trees with black scent!
 
I should have liked to show children those sunfish
Of the blue wave, the fish of gold, the singing fish.
—Foam of flowers rocked my drifting
And ineffable winds winged me at times.
 
At times a martyr weary of poles and zones,
The sea, whose sob created my gentle roll,
Brought up to me her dark flowers with yellow suckers
And I remained, like a woman on her knees...
 
Resembling an island tossing on my sides the quarrels
And droppings of noisy birds with yellow eyes
And I sailed on, when through my fragile ropes
Drowned men sank backward to sleep!
 
Now I, a boat lost in the foliage of caves,
Thrown by the storm into the birdless air
I whose water-drunk carcass would not have been rescued
By the Monitors and the Hanseatic sailboats;
 
Free, smoking, topped with violet fog,
I who pierced the reddening sky like a wall,
Bearing, delicious jam for good poets
Lichens of sunlight and mucus of azure,
 
Who ran, spotted with small electric moons,
A wild plank, escorted by black seahorses,
When Julys beat down with blows of cudgels
The ultramarine skies with burning funnels;
 
I, who trembled, hearing at fifty leagues off
The moaning of the Behemoths in heat and the thick Maelstroms,
Eternal spinner of the blue immobility
I miss Europe with its ancient parapets!
 
I have seen sidereal archipelagos! and islands
Whose delirious skies are open to the sea-wanderer:
—Is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself,
Million golden birds, o future Vigor? –
 
But, in truth, I have wept too much! Dawns are heartbreaking.
Every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter.
Acrid love has swollen me with intoxicating torpor
O let my keel burst! O let me go into the sea!
 
If I want a water of Europe, it is the black
Cold puddle where in the sweet-smelling twilight
A squatting child full of sadness releases
A boat as fragile as a May butterfly.
 
No longer can I, bathed in your languor, o waves,
Follow in the wake of the cotton boats,
Nor cross through the pride of flags and flames,
Nor swim under the terrible eyes of prison ships."
1446,Last Hope,Paul Verlaine,"Beside a humble stone, a tree
Floats in the cemetery’s air,
Not planted in memoriam there,
But growing wild, uncultured, free.
 
A bird comes perching there to sing,
Winter and summer, proffering
Its faithful song—sad, bittersweet.
That tree, that bird are you and I:
 
You, memory; absence, me, that tide
And time record. Ah, by your side
To live again, undying! Aye,
 
To live again! But ma petite,
Now nothingness, cold, owns my flesh. . .
Will your love keep my memory fresh?"
1447,Lives,Arthur Rimbaud,"I

      Oh! the huge avenues of the holy land, the terraces of the temple! What has happened to the brahmin who taught me the Proverbs? From then and from there I can still see even the old women! I remember silvery hours and sun near rivers, the hand of the country on my shoulder, and our caresses as we stood in the fiery fields. —A flight of red pigeons thunders around my thoughts—In exile here I had a stage on which to perform the dramatic masterpieces of all literatures. I might tell you about unheard-of wealth. I follow the story of the treasures you found. I see the next chapter! My wisdom is as neglected as chaos is. What is my void, compared with the stupefaction awaiting you?

      I am a far more deserving inventor than all those who went before me; a musician, in fact, who found something resembling the key of love. At present, a noble from a meager countryside with a dark sky I try to feel emotion over the memory of mendicant childhood, over my apprenticeship  when I arrived wearing wooden shoes, polemics, five or six widowings, and a few wild escapades when my strong head kept me from rising to the same pitch as my comrades. I don’t miss what I once possessed of divine happiness: the calm of this despondent countryside gives a new vigor to my terrible scepticism. But since this scepticism can no longer be put into effect, and since I am now given over to a new worry—I expect to become a very wicked fool.

      In an attic where at the age of twelve I was locked up, I knew the world and illustrated the human comedy. In a wine cellar I learned history. At some night celebration, in a northern city, I met all the wives of former painters. In an old back street in Paris I was taught the classical sciences. In a magnificent palace, surrounded by all the Orient, I finished my long work and spent my celebrated retirement. I have invigorated my blood. I am released from my duty. I must not even think of that any longer. I am really from beyond the tomb, and without work."
1448,Sleepers,David Black,"A sleeper, they used to call it—
four passes with the giant round saw
and you had a crosstie, 7 inches by 9 of white oak—
at two hundred pounds nearly twice my weight
and ready to break finger or toe—
 
 like coffin lids, those leftover slabs,
their new-sawn faces turning gold and brown
as my own in the hot Virginia sun,
drying toward the winter and the woodsaw
 
 and on the day of that chore
I turned over a good, thick one
looking for the balance point
 
 and roused a three-foot copperhead,
gold and brown like the wood,
disdaining the shoe it muscled across,
 
 each rib distinct as a needle stitching leather,
heavy on my foot as a crosstie."
1449,Ars Poetica,Paul Verlaine,"for Charles Morice

Music first and foremost! In your verse,
Choose those meters odd of syllable,
Supple in the air, vague, flexible,
Free of pounding beat, heavy or terse.
 
Choose the words you use—now right, now wrong—
With abandon: when the poet’s vision
Couples the Precise with Imprecision,
Best the giddy shadows of his song:
 
Eyes veiled, hidden, dark with mystery,
Sunshine trembling in the noonday glare,
Starlight, in the tepid autumn air,
Shimmering in night-blue filigree!
 
For Nuance, not Color absolute,
Is your goal; subtle and shaded hue!
Nuance! It alone is what lets you
Marry dream to dream, and horn to flute!
 
Shun all cruel and ruthless Railleries;
Hurtful Quip, lewd Laughter, that appall
Heaven, Azure-eyed, to tears; and all
Garlic-stench scullery recipes!
 
Take vain Eloquence and wring its neck!
Best you keep your Rhyme sober and sound,
Lest it wander, reinless and unbound—
How far? Who can say?—if not in check!
 
Rhyme! Who will its infamies revile?
What deaf child, what Black of little wit
Forged with worthless bauble, fashioned it
False and hollow-sounding to the file?
 
Music first and foremost, and forever!
Let your verse be what goes soaring, sighing,
Set free, fleeing from the soul gone flying
Off to other skies and loves, wherever.
 
Let your verse be aimless chance, delighting
In good-omened fortune, sprinkled over
Dawn’s wind, bristling scents of mint, thyme, clover . . .
All the rest is nothing more than writing."
1450,In Muted Tone,Paul Verlaine,"Gently, let us steep our love
In the silence deep, as thus,
Branches arching high above
Twine their shadows over us.
 
Let us blend our souls as one,
Hearts’ and senses’ ecstasies,
Evergreen, in unison
With the pines’ vague lethargies.
 
Dim your eyes and, heart at rest,
Freed from all futile endeavor,
Arms crossed on your slumbering breast,
Banish vain desire forever.
 
Let us yield then, you and I,
To the waftings, calm and sweet,
As their breeze-blown lullaby
Sways the gold grass at your feet.
 
And, when night begins to fall
From the black oaks, darkening,
In the nightingale’s soft call
Our despair will, solemn, sing."
1451,Innocents We,Paul Verlaine,"Their long skirts and high heels battled away:
Depending on the ground’s and breezes’ whim,
At times some stocking shone, low on the limb—
Too soon concealed!—tickling our naïveté.
 
At times, as well, an envious bug would bite
Our lovelies’ necks beneath the boughs, and we
Would glimpse a flash—white flash, ah! ecstasy!—
And glut our mad young eyes on sheer delight.
 
Evening would fall, the autumn day would draw
To its uncertain close: our belles would cling
Dreamingly to us, cooing, whispering
Lies that still set our souls trembling with awe."
1452,Moonlight,Paul Verlaine,"Your soul is like a landscape fantasy,
Where masks and Bergamasks, in charming wise,
Strum lutes and dance, just a bit sad to be
Hidden beneath their fanciful disguise.
 
Singing in minor mode of life’s largesse
And all-victorious love, they yet seem quite
Reluctant to believe their happiness,
And their song mingles with the pale moonlight,
 
The calm, pale moonlight, whose sad beauty, beaming,
Sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees,
And makes the marbled fountains, gushing, streaming—
Slender jet-fountains—sob their ecstasies."
1453,Winter Sun,Molly Fisk,"How valuable it is in these short days,
threading through empty maple branches,
the lacy-needled sugar pines.
 
 Its glint off sheets of ice tells the story
of Death’s brightness, her bitter cold.
 
 We can make do with so little, just the hint
of warmth, the slanted light.
 
 The way we stand there, soaking in it,
mittened fingers reaching.
 
 And how carefully we gather what we can
to offer later, in darkness, one body to another."
1454,Crossing Shoal Creek,J. T. Ledbetter,"The letter said you died on your tractor
crossing Shoal Creek.
There were no pictures to help the memories fading
like mists off the bottoms that last day on the farm
when I watched you milk the cows,
their sweet breath filling the dark barn as the rain
that wasn’t expected sluiced through the rain gutters.
I waited for you to speak the loud familiar words
about the weather, the failed crops—
I would have talked then, too loud, stroking the Holstein
moving against her stanchion—
but there was only the rain on the tin roof,
and the steady swish-swish of milk into the bright bucket
as I walked past you, so close we could have touched."
1455,Overtime,Jorge Evans,"Fair season and we’re tent pitching
on holy grounds in central Illinois,
busting through pavement with jack hammers,
driving home a stake that will be pulled two months
from now. One of us holds, the other presses
down, grease shooting between cracks
in the old hammer’s worn shell
to our hands and faces—one slip and we’ve
lost our toes. I’m from the warehouse,
not the tent crew. I haven’t ridden around
in tent haulers across the nation
popping tents here and there, but for this,
the state fair, the warehousers are let out
to feel important. Around us a silvered city
has risen, white vinyl tents at full mast
and clean for the first time in a year. It’s August.
It’s the summer’s dogged days when humidity
doesn’t break until midnight, an hour after
the fair’s closed down. We’re piled on back
of a flatbed with our tools, our tiredness.
We’re a monster understood best
by Midwesterners, devouring parking lots
and fields, our teeth stained by cigarette
and chew, some of us not old enough, some
too old. All of us here for the overtime."
1456,"""When I used to focus on the worries, everybody""",Joanne Kyger,"When I used to focus on the worries, everybody
                      was ahead of me, I was the bottom
                of the totem pole,
              a largely spread squat animal.

How about a quick massage now, he said to me.
I don’t think it’s cool, I replied.
Oh, said he, after a pause, I should have waited
                     for you to ask me.

The waves came in closer and closer.

When I fall into the gap of suspicion I am no longer here.

In this world that has got closed over by houses
                       and networks, I fly out
from under the belly.     Life’s dizzy crown
of whirling lights, circles this head.    Pure
with wonder, hot
with wonder.    The streets become golden.     All
size increases, the colors glow, we are in myth.

We are in easy understanding.
Scarcely talking, thoughts pass between us.
                                    It is memory.    As I search to find
this day’s sweet drifting.    The fog out to sea, the wind."
1457,Blast,Kay Ryan,"The holes have
almost left the 
sky and the blanks
the paths—the
patches next to
natural, corroborated
by the incidental
sounds of practical
activities and crows,
themselves exhibiting
many of the earmarks
of the actual. This
must have happened
many times before,
we must suppose.
Almost a pulse
if we could speed
it up: the repeated
seeking of our several
senses toward each
other, fibers trying to
reach across the gap
as fast as possible,
following a blast."
1458,Boonies,D. A. Powell,"Where we could be boys together. This region of want:
the campestrial flat. The adolescents roving across the plat.
Come hither. He-of-the-hard would call me hither.

Sheer abdomen, sheer slickensides, the feldspar buttes
that mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust. 

And I could kiss his tits and he could destroy me 
on the inflorescent slopes; in his darkest dingles;
upon the grassland’s raffish plaits. And he could roll me
in coyote brush: I who was banished to the barren
could come back into his fold, and I
would let him lay me down on the cold, cold ground.

Clouds, above, lenticular, the spreading fundament, 
a glorious breech among the thunderheads
and in their midst, a great white heron magnifies 
the day. We’d keep together, he and I,
and we’d gain meaning from our boyage; we’d pursue
each other through the crush of darkling rifts.
Climb into each other’s precipitous coombes.

Where would it end, this brush and bush, this brome
and blazing star? There is always some new way
to flex a limb and find its secret drupe.

Not only the hope of nature; the nature of hope:

so long as culverts carry us, so long as we stay ripe
to one another’s lips, and welcoming to hands,
as long as we extend our spans, to tangle them, 
as spinning insects do their glistered floss.

This is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen.
Rather: the trumpet’s bell is but a prelude.
It says we all are beautiful at least once.
And, if you’d watch over me, we can be beautiful again."
1459,Cantata for Lynette Roberts,Ange Mlinko,"Lynette, the stars are kerned so far apart—
Through a herniated zodiac I almost see your waled skylanes, your shocked Capricorn and Cancer.
In the hundred and two years since you were born, and the sixteen since your heart failed, and the nearly sixty since you gave up poetry, it seems we can’t navigate by the same star chart.
I’d like to think we were fated to work the same coracle: you steering with one hand, grasping your corner of the seine while I grasp mine; together sweeping the weirs.

Lynette saw the sky made wide-waled corduroy by the flight paths of fighter jets.
Corde du roi—“Cloth of the king.”
(“A baseless assertion,” states the oed.)
A fireman from the Midlands nfs said the raids on Swansea were worse than on Birmingham, where a ten-year-old Roy Fisher gaped at the garden where his cousins were slaughtered, and later wrote, It was like a burst pod filled with clay.

Last night, Lynette, my son thought he saw his father in the jumbo jet roaring over Cherryhurst: the weather softer, flight paths altered.
Three weeks now his father gone.

                                                                             •

Insofar as Moses came to in a coracle, it wasn’t a Welsh one-off; it wasn’t a hapax of vessels.
Insofar as it’s kind of a kiddie boat, not a kayak, not the royal barge the Makah sent William Blake, aka Johnny Depp, with into the northern Pacific; not even the Viking ship, its carved prow like an uncial; insofar as it is calico wrapped up in tar, insofar as it is swaddled willow whippets.

                                                                             •

“Pastoral ding-dong is out,” Lynette wrote, and no wonder— bombs hidden on the glossy knolls. 
In the sorrel. 
In the tormentil.
I thought she was perhaps the closest I could get to my grandmother.
While Lynette was writing “Displaced Persons”—

                   Neither from the frosted leaf nor from
                   The grey hard ground could they find
                   Relief

—Lydia was migrating, on foot, a thousand miles from Minsk to Hanover through the German lines in a different tongue.
I only have this tongue, so I adopt Lynette’s epic as a stand-in.
She slipped back to childhood in Buenos Aires, garrulous in her dying, her children spiriting a Spanish dictionary into the facil with them on visits.
I would see again São Paolo, she wrote (my mother would be reared there): the coffee-colored house with its tarmac roof.
I can imagine myself down the same funnel reverting to Portuguese and the small pure word-hoard shared between child and grandparent: suja, limpo, bom, mau, com fome, cansado.
Porcaria.
Disgraçada!
Let my children bring the dictionary too.

Lynette was ardent for penillions, and “experimented with a poem on Rain by using all words which had long thin letters....”
Maybe you thrill to such things when English isn’t fully naturalized.
Hers was a poetry full of metals and alloys; air raids they were, ear raids...

                                                                             •

I’m not so much crusted with parasangs, or dipped in leagues, as fried in miles of a journey resembling the arc between Cleo and asp.
The jacuzzi, on a timer, sank a quarter-hour in froth on a fifty-degree afternoon. 
There were sight lines to windy breakers, heaving palms; we floated like epiphytes grown from pond scum, flowers of the abyss.

The meliorative, moist air was soft around a gigantic neon cross.
And it’s true I found it hard to think of you with the hardness I thought of myself.
Since it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars of posters to adorn the walls of that apartment
(Pillsbury dough kitsch; an art deco cigar teetering on a stiletto; a wall plaque of a trilobite fossil; photo of the Sydney Opera House at night; a three-foot geode with its own spotlight on the end of what looked like a colonoscope—)
since it took all that to match the bric-a-brac on the beach, the beach that stretched to fill the picture window, 
I thought it took many waves to round the facts; an asp to soften geometric Cleopatra; and that giant cross was earth’s axis extracted—
tendering foliage over all of Florida.

                                                                             •

I’m in the backyard weeding cotyledons.
Croton.
It’s spring. 
There’s larvae noodling in the soil.
“I was rendering a ‘whipping’ stitch,” Lynette wrote, on a silk-and-georgette petticoat, the utility of which would be tested in Dover, where Keidrych had been called up to man the anti-aircraft guns.
Had his Conscientious Objector status been approved on appeal, no end to their Arcadia.
Dylan read Rabelais, drank with Keidrych; Lynette visited with Caitlin.
Household talk. 
Debts. 
Children. 
Insofar as Croton is rank with cotyledons, insofar as weeding is gleeful, insofar as the seed case still caps their tips, I am revising the look of spring on the face of the village.
Insofar as Moses slips through the reeds in his coracle.
With new beaks scissoring the air.

                                                                             •

Lynette’s village, Llanybri, is pronounced clan-ubree.
Even the l’s turn into c’s where modern warfare enters the poem as discord: clinic air. 
St. Cadoc and curlews versus confervoid; cranch-crake versus ceraunic clouds; into Euclidian cubes grid air is planed.
Where did she get the nerve?

I pencil in her age where various dates are given: 32 when she began Gods with Stainless Ears; 36 when she had her first child, 37 when she had the second; 39 or 40 when she divorced.
The nervous breakdown came at 47.
Jehovah’s Witness thereafter.
Lynette, if you were here, I’d ask you the one salient question for a woman at the midpoint of life:
How not to harden?

                                                                             •

In Little Sparta, Ian Hamilton Finlay made an image of an Oerlikon gun and inscribed:

                                                                     To Apollo: 
                                 His Music                His Missiles                His Muses

Like Lynette he observed the swarm-like behavior of fighter jets.
He saw “flame-bearing honey” in the gasoline leaked by immolated warships.
He commemorated the Flower Class Corvette, each a small naval vessel named for a blossom. 
Alyssum.
Loosestrife.
The fragility of men in battle.
The Loosestrife had eight mounts for each two-pound pom-pom anti-aircraft gun.
This was no Arcadian ding-dong either, as the corduroy bridge Finlay built on a stream had a line from Heraclitus on each plank:
That which joins and that which divides is one and the same.
Lynette says: He, of Bethlehem treading a campaign....

                                                                             •

It’s the nickel in my cheap wedding ring that brings on this rash that starts at the corners of my lips.
The ring bought at age twenty-one, paid for with the tips from Buddy’s Crabs and Ribs.
Which I now paint religiously with clear nail polish on the inner band, across the names, the ampersand, where the graving bit exposed the nickel.

                Out of this hard. Out of this sheet of zinc.
                . . .
                We, he and I ran
                On to a steel escalator, the white
                Electric sun drilling down on the cubed ice;
                Our cyanite flesh chilled on aluminum

                Rail.

The tin Madonnas of warplanes, writ small and annular in marriages, hammered out in Lynette’s ear raids.

My library is wreathed in double staircases climbing to a glass dome.
I imagine birds trapped at the top, a cucucurrucued curricula, forming and dissolving figures ad hoc.
Insofar that these are books that were ernes, atom-wise, in former eons.

The abbess of Streoneshall, Caedmon’s abbess, Hilda, was announced to her mother in a pregnancy dream: “a most valuable jewel” delivered from under her garments.
She wrote one of the books in this aerie, this library, wreathed in double staircases; lodged also in subdural interfaces.
Insofar as we’re just pre-ceviche, pre-cadavers-reinterpreting-flan, Lynette, let’s research articles, with babies at our feet: on Welsh architecture, the potato tax, coracles...
I see you floating out to sea in your coracle, the spirit of the Makah accompanying you as far as the Azores: halfway from a kitchen garden in Llanybri, halfway to a quinta in Buenos Aires."
1460,Gotham Wanes,Bryan D. Dietrich,"The mask? Because we were never ugly
enough. Because our ugliness was epic.
Because we were given to it, because 
we were so misgiven. You wear one. I
wear one. Yes. Kings, Pharaohs had them
fabricated, poured out in gold and beaten.
Most wore them to the grave. In Mexico
the living wear them, not to scare the dead
away, but as invitation. They leave candy
on the mounds of those they mourn. New
Orleans? Women wear them in order
to bare everything else. Men wear them
in order to watch. I can remember, back
before it all grows grim, making one
out of the news, trying to paste it together. 
I remember my mother helping me. I don’t 
really remember my father. Something
like a face, like the man in the moon.
I understand we’re hardwired this way,
to make faces before anything else.
It’s why we see the Madonna in mold,
alien architecture in Martian crater creep.
We keep looking for those first faces, first
familia. Every culture, every eon. Witness 
the oldest we know, his cave, his wall, one
hundred seventy centuries gone. They call 
him Sorcerer. They call me Knight.
We have always lived in the dark."
1461,“I came upon the gnawed torso of a seal”,Melanie Braverman,"I came upon the gnawed torso of a seal, silver fur agleam against the sand like a coin thrown down in a losing bet. What left this bounty of meat on the beach to rot? I watched the neighbor’s small boys skirt the dead seal the way sandpipers tease themselves in the surf, dodging up and back along the body’s shore. “It’s dead,” I told their father as he ambled behind them up the beach. He called to the little boys, his voice borne toward them on the mild breeze. “Boys, come back,” he said, and they did not."
1462,“I used to love the run-up to a storm”,Melanie Braverman,"I used to love the run-up to a storm, watching from the porch as the grown-ups hurried to bring things in, my mother rummaging through drawers for a flashlight, cursing: nothing was where it was supposed to be in our house. It can’t be so, but the only people I ever remember huddled in the basement were my mother and me, suspended in that eerie half-light like bats. We’ve just spent a week like this, my mother perched in a chair above the water keeping watch for the next bad thing. We were happy so sometimes she’d let the vigil rest, the sentry of her shoulders easing to a more receptive pose, a quarter moon, until something called her back to the watch, mother first no longer but this white, foremost light. You can read by it. You can see."
1463,Leaves,Gerald Stern,"He was cleaning leaves for one at a time
was what he needed and a minute before the two
brown poodles walked by he looked at the stripped-down trees

part of a system in which the dappled was foreign
for he had arrived at his own conclusion and that was
for him a relief even if he was separated,
even if  his hands were frozen,
even if the wind knocked him down,
even if his cat went into her helpless mode
inside the green and sheltering Japanese yew tree."
1464,The Name,Gerald Stern,"Having outlived Allen I am the one who

thin and wasted, and not too salty the way the
Chinese further down sometimes make them, the
name still on my mind whatever the reason for
mystery, or avoidance, though rat Netanyahu
and pig that swings from a needle or lives in some
huge incubator, they do darkness where there
was light, the name hates them, the name
in hiding, the name with a beard, and Linda she
loves the name though she invokes her Christ
as Jack her lover and tormentor did and
taught her to do though it is too easy, that,
it troubles me but what can I say, what should I
say while we walk north on the right hand side,
past the pork store and the hardware store, me lecturing
on Logos (my God) and what not Hebrews and Greeks

can’t imagine
how bright
more of it
could be,
the way
this much
defeats night.
It almost
isn’t fair,
whoever
poked this,
with such
a small act
to vanquish
blackness."
1467,Poem (External Scene),Dan Beachy-Quick,"The field blank in snow. But I mean this page.
Now print mars the surface to make surface
Seen. Sheen only error brings. Perfect rage
So the sun rises. Rage is your slow practice
That makes of every day another day
In whose gathering promise the shy sparrows
Shiver instead of sing. I want to go away.
See these footsteps? These black shapes in the snow?
If there is a word for them, it’s no word 
I know. Pursuit?, no. Proof?, no. Don’t call it fear.
Could I cross this white sheet if I were coward,
Edge to edge, margin to margin, never
Referring to anything outside itself?—
Stop that. Stop pointing to the photo on the shelf."
1468,Poem (Internal Scene),Dan Beachy-Quick,"To make beauty out of pain, it damns the eyes—
No, dams the eyes. See how they overflow?
No damns them, damns them, and so they cry.
What shape can I swallow to make me whole?
Baby’s bird-shaped block, blue-painted wood
That fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood box?
The skeleton leaf? The skeleton key? Loud
Knock when the shape won’t unlock any locks.
I hear it through the static in the baby’s room
When the monitor clicks on and off, sound
Of sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocks,
Laughing gull in the gale. What is it dives down
Past sight, down there dark with the other blocks?
It can’t be seen, only heard. A kind of curse,
This kind curse. Forgive me. Blessing that hurts."
1469,“The pond is sheathed in ice”,Melanie Braverman,"The pond is sheathed in ice, a duck troubles the reeds, the air around us still enough to hear the baby stir, but we don’t know where it is yet. By the force of our longing it is getting made for us, as thrilled people, palms full of seed, long for the chickadees to light, and they do. Light."
1470,The Road to Emmaus,Spencer Reece,"For Nathan Gebert

                                                    I
The chair from Goodwill smelled of mildew.
I sat with Sister Ann, a Franciscan. 
In her small office, at the Cenacle Retreat House, 
right off Dixie Highway in Lantana, Florida,
I began my story—
it was an interview, much of life is an interview.
She said I did not need to pay her, but donations,
yes, donations were appreciated:
they could be left anonymously in a plain white envelope
that she could take back to the cloister.
She was dressed in a turtleneck and a denim jumper.
She could have been mistaken in a grocery store for an aging housewife.
My meetings with her went on for a few years.

I had come to speak about Durell.
I did not know how to end sentences about Durell.
He had taught me—what? To live? Not to wince in the mirror? 
What? There were so many ways to end my sentence.
He was an unlikely candidate for so many things.
Outside, it was always some subtle variation of summer.
I paused, then spoke urgently, not wanting to forget some fact, 
but much I knew I would forget or remember in a way my own,
which would not exactly be correct, no, not exactly.
Durell was dead, I said, and I needed to make sense of things.

Sister Ann’s face was open, fragile—
parts were chipped like on a recovered fresco.
Above her gray head, 
a garish postcard of the Emmaus scene,
the colors off, as if painted by numbers, with no concern for shading— 
the style of it had an unoriginal Catholic institutional uniformity.
There it hung, askew in its golden drugstore frame.
It was the scene from the end of Luke, the two disciples,
one named Cleopas, the other anonymous, 
forever mumbling Christ’s name, and with them, 
the resurrected Christ masquerading as a stranger. 
They were on their way to that town, Emmaus,
seven miles out from Jerusalem,
gossiping about the impress of Christ’s vanishing—
they argued about whether to believe what they had seen;
they were restless, back and forth the debate went—
when there is estrangement there is little peace.

                                                    ii

Every time we met, Sister Ann prayed first.
At times, my recollections blurred or a presumption would reverse.
Sister Ann told me Durell was with me still,
in a more intimate way than when he lived.
She frequently lost her equilibrium, as older people sometimes do,
before settling into her worn-out chair 
where she listened to me, week after week. 

The day I met Durell, I said, the morning light was clear,
startling the town with ornament.
The steeple of Christ Church held the horizon in place,
or so I imagined, as if it had been painted first
with confident amounts of titanium white
before the rest was added. Trees clattered.
The reiterating brick puzzle of Cambridge brightened—
Mass Avenue, Mount Auburn, Dunster, Holyoke—
proclaimed a new September, and new students trudged the streets.
Every blood-warm structure was defined in relief.

Hours before, while the moon’s neck wobbled on the Charles 
like a giraffe’s, or the ghost of a giraffe’s neck, 
I imagined Durell labored, having slept only a few hours,
caged in his worries of doctor bills, no money,
and running out of people to ask for it:
mulling over mistakes, broken love affairs—
a hospital orderly, a man upstairs,
he probably mumbled unkind epithets about blacks and Jews,
even though the men he loved were blacks and Jews.
Some of his blasphemies, if you want to call them that,
embarrassed me in front of Sister Ann,
but she seemed unflappably tolerant.

At sixty, he was unemployable.
He had taught school and guarded buildings,
each job ending worse than the last.
His refrain was always: “It is not easy being an impoverished aristocrat.”
He spoke with the old Harvard accent, 
I can still hear it, I will probably always hear it,
with New York City, the North Shore and the Army mixed in,
the a’s broadened, the r’s were flat, the t’s snapped—
so a sentence would calibrate to a confident close,
like “My dee-ah boy, that is that.”
He lived on 19 Garden Street in a rent-controlled studio
on the second floor, number 25; he said the “25” reminded him of Christmas.

At eleven o’clock, 
he probably pulled on his support hose,
increasing the circulation in his legs, blotched green and black.
Next, he would have locked the door with his gold key
and moved deliberately, his smile beleaguered.
Bowing to Miss Littlefield in the landlord’s office
at the building’s dark cubbyhole of an entrance:
they probably spoke of Queen Elizabeth ii, 
her disappointments, for Miss Littlefield and he were Royalists both.
Then Durell began to move towards me, entering the Square.
Breathing heavily, he might have passed the Brattle 
advertising Judgment at Nuremberg—
inside the shut black theatrical box where the world repeated the past,
Maximilian Schell interrogated Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift;
Marlene Dietrich let the phone ring and ring.
Maybe he passed the Store 24 sign, bright orange,
passed Nini’s Corner where sex magazines were stacked like a cliff.
Maybe, maybe. But, maybe not. 
Maybe he went another way.

Then I recalled how the t shook that place, 
the subway grates pushing up the scent of rat-life and all things fallen,
mixing with Leavitt & Peirce exuding its masculine snuff.
Down Plympton Street he might have gone, past the Grolier, 
which I always remembered, for some reason, as closed,
gilded with spines of poetry books for its reredos.
Yes, he probably, most likely, certainly, did that.
Sister Ann wondered if I thought he paused. 
I thought not—
poetry offered him no solutions.

At twelve o’clock, 
the chairperson called our aa meeting to order.
We called ourselves “The Loony Nooners,” 
and met in a Lutheran church basement.
We ate salads out of Tupperware,
shaking the contents like dice to mix the dressing.
Some knitted. Schizophrenics lit multiple cigarettes.
Acne-pocked Kate wanted to be a model,
Electroshock Mike read paperbacks,
and an Irish professor named Tom,
welcomed Tellus, who could not get over Nam.
Darkened figures in the poor light, we looked like the burghers of Calais,
and smelled of brewed coffee, smoke, perfume, urine, human brine. 
We were aristocrats of time:
“I have twenty-one years,” “I have one week,” “I have one day.”
I have often thought we were like first-century Christians—
a strident, hidden throng, electrified by a message.
Or, another way of thinking of us, 
is that we were inconvenient obstacles 
momentarily removed, much to the city’s relief.
From each window well, high heels and business shoes hurried.
Durell H., as he was known to us, took his place,
his thick hair fixed as the waves of an 1800s nautical painting
(perhaps he kept it set with hair spray?),
his Tiffany ring polished to a brilliance,
he set himself apart in his metal folding chair.
He had the clotted girth of Hermann Göring.
What was he thinking about?
Was he thinking about blood clots and possible aneurysms?
Imperious, behind prism-like trifocals,
quietly he said to me, “I’ve grown as fat as Elizabeth Taylor.”

                                                    iii

The meeting ended and Durell folded his metal chair.
He hated his Christian name—
“Durell,” he said, “Who names their child Durell?”
Moving among the crowd, listening to success and failure,
he passed out meeting lists, literature, leaflets.
Durell sponsored men, he referred to them as “pigeons.”
I met him that day. I was his last.

After that, every day we spoke on rotary phones.
I was young and spoke as if my story was the only one.
I told him I had underlined key passages in Plato’s Symposium,
told him I had been graded unfairly on Dante’s Inferno and Purgatorio,
told him my schedule might not allow for the Paradiso.
He matched my telling with listening, advising, 
and more listening, mostly over the phone, 
and the more he listened the more he was alone. 
“Why was that?” Sister Ann asked.
It was some sort of offering, perhaps. 
At times it seemed he needed to guarantee a pardon,
that old Catholic idea of indulgences 
lurked somewhere there unspoken,
as if he believed a larger offering might guarantee a larger pardon. 
Such a task demanded his increased singleness. 
Yes, that was true. Or was it?
I had trouble settling on the right words with Sister Ann.
Many of my words were not exactly right, the syntax awkward.
I kept having trouble translating Durell, so much I guessed. 
How to know?
(Why hadn’t I asked him more questions?
He wasn’t the sort that invited questions, I do remember that.)
Another way of saying it was that when he was with me, 
on the phone, then and only then, did he seem to move in truth 
and in his truths, reprimanding and hard, 
he was made more singular. Maybe that was it.
Whatever the case, he listened, he listened to me.
I missed his listening.
Listening, Sister Ann said, is a memorable form of love.

After the meeting, he gave me his calling card.
The cards were placed inside his compulsively polished silver card case,
the black capitals raised on their ecru background,
containing his name, bracketed by a “Mr.” and a “Jr.”—
the “Mr.” denoting lost civility,
the “Jr.” tallying a lineage that did not bridge.
As we walked down Church Street, the bells of St. John the Evangelist rang.
The road was bright, the road full.
Behind the brown gate with the thick black rusted latch,
the monks sang, “It is well, it is well, with my soul, with my soul.”
We peered in at bookshop clerks locating titles,
watch repairmen bent over lit ocular devices, fixing movements,
florists, hands wet, arranging stems and branches broken.
We saw ourselves reflected.
I laughed with deference, the way a student laughs before a teacher.
His skin was flecked with milk-blues, lead-whites, earthen reds.
In dress and demeanor he was as rigid as a toy soldier,
for he was a part of a republic with standards, atrophied, devoted to order.

Everyone found him impossible,
including, at times, me.
Of queers, his word for what he was but could not admit to,
he said, “You know in the army they could never be trusted.”
I mentioned romantic love.
In profile, a silhouette, he paused.
He said, “It has been very vexing, indeed.”
By his tone, I knew never to ask again.
A decorum of opprobrium kept him whole,
and so he guarded himself with intensity. 
Maybe, Sister Ann suggested, he was guarding me.

Durell said, “I’ve whittled my world down to no one,
Spencer, with the possible exception of you.”

                                                    iv

“What happened then?” Sister Ann asked.
He excused himself with a handshake, his palms soft as bread dough
from all the Jergens he had slathered on,
and then he probably returned to his ambry of a studio, 
a place where I would be one of his only visitors.
Although he handed out his number, he did not always answer.
I remember...
(What do I remember?)... 
I was free to turn away but the moment I looked back,
Durell would come back to me, 
waiting for me. It seems to me now, after all this time, 
few things have as much fidelity as the past.

I remember he had nailed memorabilia above his head
as one would place stones to fortify a castle:
a photograph of him in the army, liberating people, undoing Russian codes;
a framed marriage license from England
(although the marriage failed, he often mumbled her name);
his framed diploma, Harvard, and over the corner hung
his graduation cap’s faded black tassel.
Next to his pill bottles, an Edward viii coronation mug he doted on,
commemorating an event that never took place.
Maybe he made a bread and baloney sandwich.
Maybe he stepped over the rolled-up tag-sale carpet and drew the shades.
By late evening, he might have jotted down notes about God,
obedient as he was to the twelve steps of aa.
He might have written in his tightly-looped feminine penmanship,
informed by the Palmer Method,
and later repeated a phrase or two to me over the phone.
Or maybe he read from his Twenty-Four Hours a Day book
to find a rule maybe, or to search for a sanctuary.
Or maybe he listened to the Reverend Peter Gomes on the radio,
The Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard,
for he often mentioned how he loved the preacher’s parallel constructions,
yes, maybe he did that, maybe, possibly, he did that.

And then, perhaps, he slept a bit
before the whole routine began once more 
with the support hose, the hair spray, Miss Littlefield, the sex magazines, 
the Grolier, the folding chair, the meeting, the calling card.
How crazy America was, he said, how he wanted to leave,
but he never left town, except jolting trips to the hospital
in an ambulance down all those brick roads.

                                                    v

I lived in Cambridge two years. 
After that, wherever I moved, we spoke, daily, over the phone, on landlines —
talking and listening, listening and talking, for fifteen years:
“You alright?” “Yes. You?”
In all that time, I saw him only once more, and by then he was nearly blind.
In all that time, we barely touched one another.
Why our relationship required its rood screen, 
I could not fully explain to Sister Ann,
indeed, I can never seem to properly explain it to anyone.
But I have tried, and I will probably always keep trying.
But if I get nothing right,
I must try to get a nuance of our friendship
and his sponsorship right— 
we were bound, bound by a vow, a vow of attention
(there are many causes for attention, among them redemption).
Our attention concerned the spirit,
although that sounds pious and we were not so pious,
we were more selfish, more human than pious.
What else can I say?
I needed a liberator
and liberators can come in some unexpected guises.
I may never wholly explain the two of us.
Perhaps the spirit defies the human mind, 
even after all my time with Sister Ann.

Finally, from a hospital, came the report of Durell’s last day.
A charge nurse said: “I touched the gangrene leg, pink flesh was coming back.”
His compliments had increased the more his life failed.
In the final week, he quoted Cole Porter songs to me—
You’re a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeare sonnet, you’re Mickey Mouse...
I did not repeat the rhymes to Sister Ann.
Who Durell was and why he did what he did and why he hid
what he hid I kept asking her. 
Sister Ann quoted from Deuteronomy:
“I set before you life and death...choose life.”

Old pigeon flying back,
when I arrived at the hospital his body was gone.
The formalities were few,
for he had become a ward of the state.
The staff gave me a brown grocery bag of his things:
a roll of dimes, a pair of shoes, a belt buckle, an Einstein quote,
something about mediocre minds.
Afterwards, I went through Cambridge and found the meeting gone.
Night was coming. 
Blindness worked on the people, shops, churches, streets.
No one knew me.
People said: “Where will we go?” and “What will we eat?”
I thought I recognized this or that face, but no, no, too much time had passed.
On Church Street, restaurants had replaced bookstores.
Windows on Mass Avenue shone with chandeliers.
Someone backed up photographing with a flash.
“Hold still,” they said, “hold still.”
A new set of homeless people pleaded,
coins rattled inside the used coffee cups they shook.
Everyone moved with packages, briefcases, textbooks, flash cards, cell phones, flowers.
The Charles advanced, determined as a hearse,
its dark waters gathering up every unattached thing.
An umber, granular dusk-light fell on the elms over Harvard Yard
as they swayed dark and slow
like the chords in the waltz from Copeland’s Rodeo.
There I stood, unsure of which way to go.
The light had more ghosts in it as it must have had that day in Emmaus.

                                                    vi

Suddenly, Sister Ann announced our last meeting.
Down the linoleum hallway,
Sister Katherine and Sister Ruth moved and prayed.
Their numbers had dropped from seven to six,
and the nuns decided the Retreat House would close.
Soon, the chapel and offices would be leveled and replaced with condominiums.
In the halls, the swoosh-snap of duct tape yanked, pulled and cut,
straps tightened, vans bleating, and backing up into the back,
weather reports exchanged with the movers.
Sister Ann told me about herself that final time:
parents dead, alcoholic brother dead,
the brother embarrassed she had been a nun.
She opened her Bible on the shipping box between us,
leaned in, her hearing aids on, her silver crucifix knocking on her chest.
Above her head, a nail where the Emmaus scene had hung.

I asked: “What caused him to remain?” 
Why did he want freedom for me?
Sister Ann spoke then of the Gospel of John
and the Samaritan woman at the well, 
the one married nearly as many times as Elizabeth Taylor, 
and how when Christ listened to her she became the first evangelist. 
It was Christ’s longest conversation with anyone Sister Ann said.
The Samaritan woman’s life changed because Christ listened to her.

John K., from the meetings, dead now too, once said:
“Oh, I knew Durell. He was odd. But we’re all odd you know.”
All I know now
is the more he loved me the more I loved the world.

                                                    vii

I lost track of Sister Ann. 
I have often thought about her and all the time she spent with me.
I have wanted to tell her now for some time
that not long after the cloister closed, Durell’s sister located me,
leaving a message on my answering machine,
(it was still the time of answering machines),
inviting me to her winter house in Boynton Beach.

Durell’s sister gave me directions. 
She was quite close to me, as it turned out.
She had some of Durell’s belongings that she wanted me to have.
“There isn’t much,” she said. 
“But still, I think you should have what’s here.”
Durell spoke of his sister often, 
but I did not know his family.
However, when we met, we recognized each other
as one sometimes recognizes what one has never seen before.

I said to her: “He knew me better than anyone.”
The sentence surprised us.
We sat by the pool in her gated country club.
The Florida evening was a watercolor in the making,
colors bleeding into striking mistakes.
After all the members withdrew, 
she said, “There are many things you do not know about my brother.”
A worker folded terry cloth towels under a bamboo hut.
Her voice halted as voices halt 
when words have been withheld. 
“They called him names,” she said, “A nancy boy, a priss, a sissy, a fairy...”
The pool’s tempos ceased 
until the silence about us was the silence in a palace.

Light disappeared everywhere. 
The sun fell. She looked away,
said that he’d been to the army language school,
learned German and Russian, played the organ in his spare time,
mentioned he’d taken music with Copland at Harvard
(he had received a “gentleman’s ‘C’”— 
the “C” stood for Copland she said he always said—
which made us laugh and seemed to beckon him to us).
He had hoped for an army career, she went on,
and then she mumbled something about a little German town, 
I think she said it was in Schleswig-Holstein, near Lübeck,
where he was stationed while borders were being redrawn,
the letters stopping, the army, the men, something, the drink...
and then her words fell and sank 
into subtle variations of all that goes unsaid.

We heard the distant sound of a train on its track,
crossing the Florida map going brown then black.
He became difficult, isolated—
she spoke softly then like the penitent.
He was always asking for money.
As his requests persisted she began to screen her calls. 
“It became easier to tell him I had not been home,” she said.
His behavior was affecting her marriage.
She chose never to introduce her children to Durell.
Perhaps he had a mental illness, perhaps he invented— 
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps—
but no, she pressed on, perhaps it was his sexuality, he was too sensitive...
“People can be cruel,” she said.
She felt he had never adjusted to cruelty
as if cruelty was something that one needed to adjust to.
Later, he was picked up for charges of soliciting sex.
And the more she told me, the less I knew.
All about us, a stillness began to displace the light
and Durell was there, and no longer there, staining that stillness.
After an estrangement ends there comes a great stillness, 
the greater the estrangement the greater the stillness.
Across the parking lot, a gate rattled.

I told her he often said his life had been a failure,
I tried to convince him otherwise, but he never believed me.
Half a century ago, she broke off contact.
Her protracted estrangement made her look ill.
“Please, please,” she said.  
Her voice trailed off,
although what she was pleading for was not clear.
No, no, she did not want her grandchildren to know.
Subtle variations of Florida evening light withdrew with finality.
The pool brightened with moonlight, the color of snow.
The pool was still.
There we were,
a man and a woman sitting in cushioned lounge chairs, 
as if the world would always be an endless pair of separated things.
We did not touch each other.
We were still a long time."

1473,Buddhist New Year Song,Diane di Prima,"I saw you in green velvet, wide full sleeves
seated in front of a fireplace, our house
made somehow more gracious, and you said
“There are stars in your hair”— it was truth I
brought down with me

to this sullen and dingy place that we must make golden
make precious and mythical somehow, it is our nature,
and it is truth, that we came here, I told you,
from other planets
where we were lords, we were sent here,
for some purpose

the golden mask I had seen before, that fitted
so beautifully over your face, did not return
nor did that face of a bull you had acquired
amid northern peoples, nomads, the Gobi desert

I did not see those tents again, nor the wagons
infinitely slow on the infinitely windy plains,
so cold, every star in the sky was a different color
the sky itself a tangled tapestry, glowing
but almost, I could see the planet from which we had come

I could not remember (then) what our purpose was
but remembered the name Mahakala, in the dawn

in the dawn confronted Shiva, the cold light
revealed the “mindborn” worlds, as simply that,
I watched them propagated, flowing out,
or, more simply, one mirror reflecting another.
then broke the mirrors, you were no longer in sight
nor any purpose, stared at this new blackness
the mindborn worlds fled, and the mind turned off:

a madness, or a beginning?"
1474,Coping Prana,Will Alexander,"It is the way I breathe
through chronic terrifying ferns
through a black ungracious stoma

it is this uranium rejoinder
this impact pointing backwards

& when witnessed
causes observers to panic
to blur
& forget
& to flee

they can’t see my approach
my wayward dorsal looming
my lettering in black drizzle

it is my approach
my weaving
my sigil as curved embankment

therefore
I can never name myself
or plot myself
according to the sparks or the splinters from the work bench

dazed
ruthless with salivation
with my awkward insular roaming
I am like a few darkened eaglets riveted against the moon

then I am brought to a table by deafness
feasting with herons
which spins me by embranglement
by in-circular abatement
always seeking to have me neutered beneath my derma
so as to talk to myself
so as to cancel my structureless scrutiny

they speak of me as lawless
as despicable
as a typhoon in a sea well
as to morals
as to fixed & accelerated combination

they fix me
as deserted
bereft
as a fragment from a starving lion’s compendium

I am considered
as pointless positron without image
as hieroglyph
as sundial
as martyr

being leakage from a barbarous index province"

I give him moonstones

                   I use for his pleasure
                   silk, & green hills

     just a played reference
There were newspaper clips
     all police brutality, all framed with snow
& I vaguely recalled something
     about Uma Thurman & the Menils
when the guard ushered me out
     for touching the African sculptures
I waited in the lobby for hours
     like this morning reading
that he overdosed. It was a hotel
     & I didn’t even know him
I don’t even know his work"
1477,First Rites,Micah Ballard,"Besides Sundays there were Wednesday evenings and the occasional Tuesday. They called Tuesdays “visitation” and we would meet in the parking lot and load into a van. There were little cards with peoples’ names and addresses on them and we’d drive around until contact was made. I always managed to hide a few cards and claimed carsickness but it was too humid to stay in the van. Oftentimes I’d recognize someone from school and felt like apologizing but couldn’t. On Wednesdays, it was a bit easier because we arrived early so my mom could volunteer. I skated the parking curbs on the side of the building and could hear the choir practice. Other times I’d wait on the stairs at the cosmetology school next door. There was this kid who dropped out of eighth grade, and I was his lookout while he smoked. He preferred to be called Fluid and got kicked out of youth group more than once. The youth minister was large and pale and wore tight shirts that made sweat stains around his belly. One day we went on a retreat that turned out to be a rented trailer in the country. In the afternoon we watched films inside and at night played games in the dark. I wound up sleeping under a table listening to Sanitarium from 
Master of Puppets
 on repeat. The following morning my headphones were taken away so I could be open to the message. Other retreats included all night bowling and Friday night lock-up. Arrival was at ten and they would keep us awake with caffeine, sweets, and more games. I frequently got nervous being separated into groups and remember once winning a race in the foyer wearing high-heels. Later I escaped to the pews of the sanctuary. It was pitch black and I found myself standing in a drained baptismal with white robes hanging over the windows. It was strange to see where all those people went after the altar calls. Those were on Sunday mornings and the services were very long and formal. It was important to sit behind the older ladies so you could sleep behind their hair. After the closing song I’d wait in the car seemingly for hours, listening to mix tapes, mostly Suicidal Tendencies or Maiden. Then we’d drive to a Chinese restaurant or go to this pizza place that had a buffet. I’d watch the others play video games but most of the time I’d just go outside. The clouds were always cumulus and some afternoons you could hear the wind and think about what it’d be like to be somewhere else. It really didn’t matter though, maybe I could get dropped off at a friend’s, watch 
Kung-Fu Theater
, or skate the mini-ramp in the backyard. He had twin sisters and we could do whatever we wanted."
1478,"First Snow, Kerhonkson",Diane di Prima,"for Alan

This, then, is the gift the world has given me
(you have given me)
softly the snow
cupped in hollows
lying on the surface of the pond
matching my long white candles
which stand at the window
which will burn at dusk while the snow
fills up our valley
this hollow
no friend will wander down
no one arriving brown from Mexico
from the sunfields of California, bearing pot
they are scattered now, dead or silent
or blasted to madness
by the howling brightness of our once common vision
and this gift of yours—
white silence filling the contours of my life."
1479,Just Sepia,Micah Ballard,"I refuse to settle
out of the true
choose to communicate
through pay phones and paper
out here in the country of McAllister & Steiner
we are the only Victorians left
& I wish I wouldn’t have said
that one something that one time
when what I really wanted
was to finish cutting the okra for the gumbo
& read Baudelaire again
his L’Invitation au Voyage
backwards reveals all of the magic
in writing that one can endure
each line out loud resounds perfect
all week I’ve been thinking about printing
a pirated book of such, nothing grand
typed on the Remington, 3x4, no address
no copyright and fifty limited
for whomever I run into"
1480,On Anti-Biography,Will Alexander,"For me, biography is a lantern, burning in the midst of parenthetical opaqueness. In a sense, it is a ruse, a phantasmic meandering, brighter or dimmer, according to the ecletic happenstance of terror. 


Me, I’ve been sired in anomaly, in an imagery of brewing grenadine riddles, a parallel poesis spawned from curious seismographic molten. I say curious, because the original stalking arc has disappeared into the wilderness of an a priori blizzard, which gives birth to a level, like a portal of fire conjoined with the lightning field of mystery. I call it the poetic guardian dove, the hieratic alien wing. 


It is the non-local field, the non-particle acid, flowing into my cognitive iodine rays, into the vicious fires of my tarantella marshes. So I dance with vibration, with the solar arc spinning backward around the miraculous force of a double green horizon. Simultaneously, I escape the territorial, while remaining within the burning loops of my own momentary seizures, guarded by ferns, legs plowing land, the face and the mind guided by stars. 


So, I am a martyr of drills, of spates of specific lingual flooding, casting at times, a mist or a mirage, like a caravan of yaks, transporting tungsten and water. Conversely, to give a graph of dates, to single out a bevy of personal social lesions, would invert me, would turn me around a diurnal bundle of glass, staggered, with a less than fiery temperature, partially nulling my sensitivity to falling phonemic peppers, to the inclination towards victory which burns in the dawn above heaven. For me, this is the green locale, the pleroma of eternal solar essence, glinting, full of fabulous maelstrom diamonds, an empowered hegira of drift, of claustrophobic rainbow spectrums which empty themselves, and return to themselves, like having an image go out and return to itself, so that its power transmutes by the very energy of its looping; and I think of myself, the poet sending signals into mystery, and having them return to me with oneiric wings and spirals, so much so, that I forget my prosaic locale with its stultifying anchors, with its familial dotage and image reports, with its dates inscribed in trapezoidal feces. I am only concerned with simultaneity and height, with rays of monomial kindling, guiding the neo-cortex through ravens, into the ecstasy of x-rays and blackness."

1482,The Pointless Nether Plow,Will Alexander,"It is farming in an inclement sun system
like a powerless nether beast

fruit changes form
light then quavers across distorted mural relics

his wheat suspended & flaring

carving his soil with volcanic blue seeds"
1483,"Song for Baby-O, Unborn",Diane di Prima,"Sweetheart
when you break thru
you’ll find
a poet here
not quite what one would choose.

I won’t promise
you’ll never go hungry

baby
enough to love
to break your heart
forever"
1484,Wayfaring,Micah Ballard,"I see into them
as they see out of me
& dissolve the wattage
to avoid future legends
young pharaohs on Fillmore cracking dutches

forgotten game skulking around

thine presence undoes
do not attempt to circle the inferno
a tremor in the throne
is a tremor in the throne"
1485,The Window,Diane di Prima,"you are my bread

noise
of my bones

you have no hands

breaks on a windowpane
where no light talks

for crossing tongues

never shifts)

tomorrow
turned you with his toe
and you will
shine
and shine
unspent and underground"
1486,Epithalamion,Robert Fernandez,"At once this dragnet of cousins
Whips its way into your presence saying
 None of them among us. They are
Oracles on the court of midnight,
The tight filigree of a mind or your
Splashing around in, your pandemonium
Of copper graffiti inexpertly put up.
They make weapons of furled hands.
“We will walk, but our bones will carry
Ribbons of lead, or we will, like
Acrobats mill-headed in 3s (3 blades,
3 hips, 3 tongues), answer to what comes
Before, what comes before?” Eleousa,
Master of Dark Eyelids, eye opening
Like a fennel seed, you are generous
Or are you not, do you shore up and
Wink at the soul? What does the soul say
Other than “my divorce from . . .,” “tan
Holiday . . .,” “smoking crystal in teak rooms . . .”
But should have asked, “What do you
See?” The sun a sequence of fans, a bridge,
Only so exquisitely cabled as to make us
Still—shall we fall
Or travel between bridges
Among the robust, sane clouds,
A face cut from smoke, heat, and light?
The sun, dancing in a vial, the initial
Memory of what it was to be born—
Doberman of a sheer-white universe—
To school out—the audacity of rising
Without name or color to new rooms,
New youth, fruitful, born singularly
To precise moments not in epiphany
But duration—as under new weather
We become—in action, receive—our
Bodies uncasked like umbrellas under
The flamingo-red light of the racing day."
1487,Wave Trough,Robert Fernandez,"Sets the folds in alignment;
this a shallow, a constitution of drops
that moves to displace itself
and unconsciously reverts
to image.

In such a state,
the wave has become a setting—
a table across which cups
with propositions rolled inside them
are passed.

The passage of cups does not limit
the range of potential outcomes,
and yet at no point does the wave
dissolve into abstraction.

The shades
are drawn and we are
overwhelmed by flags
crossing the black divan.

An axis of rotation,
gliding a fraction of an inch
and yet unveiling its total mass.

Advancing, the disc of its body
shimmers. Alighting on the sand,
it reveals itself in a cluster of pulses.

Dilated, it lifts from the sea floor:
fine spokes radiating on a wheel.
It passes between bands of bright
water, a kiss or a plow."
1488,The Crystal in Tamalpais,Joanne Kyger,"In Tamalpais is a big crystal. An acquaintance told
me the story. A Miwok was giving his grandfather’s medicine
bag to the Kroeber Museum in Berkeley. He said this man
took him over the mountain Tamalpais, at a certain time
in the year. I believe it was about the time of the
Winter Solstice, because then the tides are really low.
They stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over
the mountain. On their way to the Bolinas Beach clam patch,
where there is a big rock way out there.

                                                                            Go out to
the rock. Take out of the medicine bag the crystal
that matches the crystal in Tamalpais. And
                                              if your heart is not true
                                              if your heart is not true
when you tap the rock in the clam patch
                                                            a little piece of it will fly off
                                                   and strike you in the heart
                          and strike you dead.

And that’s the first story I ever heard about Bolinas."
1489,Fairy Tales from the Web,Ish Klein,"Somebody who would never refuse money told me this—
about the syncretic effect when each person plugs
their attention into a field to read ad copy, let’s just say
they become opened up and other beings can see into
their minds. This was considered a science fiction idea
to many people, but not to me.
In my negative space construction is always occurring.

The liftoff from awful to tolerable
to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful
has been my most difficult task to swing.
But swing I will; there’s nothing else to do.
I live here and being here and hearing myself
or my mind’s divide through others convinces me
that I must do everything I can to save us from the pit.

That is, until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows.
You may have a tree of your own—you may have a home
in your own tree. Congratulations. If you write an instructive
pamphlet you can bet I will read it.
I do not want to go out in darkness.
I am doing everything I know to prevent this,
and thank you, by the way, if you’ve written a pamphlet.

The shared information system
and each being at the end of its screen
emits an LED (light emitting diode) on an often
green screen—you say I should give my
father up to the authorities. You blame your
circumstances on my choice—but it’s the authorities who
did this to him. How do you think a person loses his mind?
He let someone take it.

He is sort of my mind and you are too,
God help me.
The green screen is an ingenious discovery.
You can record events in a studio before the screen
and then key in whatever environment you like.
It’s a special color: Chroma Green,
but it can be blue too.

The experience of things is determined by our
feelings about them. Information is colored
by us. You may see remotely, in a photograph
for instance, the image of an ambush victim.
Maybe it is a war and/or she is caught naked.
If she is unhappy—indicated by face and body
arrangement—you may feel that.

Some people will hate the state of things that made her
so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it.
How do you find her? What guns surround her country?
And after all, maybe she would hate it.
To have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation.
She may only be thinking about humiliation.

That is a tough feeling to shake.
Then, and I need not go too far into this,
then there are those who see the pain of someone
and they just love it. This may have something
to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound.
The wound, they think, is everyone else’s fault
and they cannot forgive. This is only information,
in the form of speculation.

Some feelings you get when you consider
“What if this happened to me?” and you will want to remedy
the situation to secure yourself from the (negative) condition of it.
Together, humans create one body—the planet earth
and its projections. The things in the stomach
affect what goes on in the head. On the web
many people make money with miracle potions.

Some curb the human appetite.
Some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want.
I heard the other girl refer to me as a skull.
She was very angry and did not look or say hello.
There is a prevalent competitive notion
that each only has one place. That her face is only
hers and that I don’t have a face or to her it is death.

This she reads as me—the death of her.
Obviously I am not. I write and read and
then roll on. I wear an ordinary human face,
some could compare me to a bird of prey
because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long
and I like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back.
I am not here to attack.

You are also a mutant.
Do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you?
Do you think you can go to sleep here
and wake up the same?
The screen is framed by plastic,
beneath that you use words to issue commandments
or call-outs.

Most people use the web to send messages
to people who are already their friends.
They make arrangements for later and
detail what happened in the past.
This information may be not true.
The web cannot know intention.
It records and is open to influence.

People make money through advertisements,
or so they think—well, selling ads, that’s quantifiable—
if ads make money, that is more difficult
to know unless there are special offers.
The web is full of special offers and 30-day
trials. If you fall for those, or I should say,
if you respond to the offer

what often happens is that your information
is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox
with offers (that which is known as spam).
Because you are someone who wants to look great
and there are other companies with products compatible
with your stated desire. Ways for you to achieve
the prevailing notion of beauty.

It is my job to tell you the models
are selected because they are physically improbable.
They are elevated to be made desirable.
Their desirability is physical because they are models.
If it were easy to be like that, they would not
be sought-after by manufacturers.
Generally, working people need to be sturdy.

Advertisers want to make money.
They go with psychology and so create a sort of
self-rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people.
They know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form
no matter what station they are from.
Everyone wants to be beautiful.
Everyone wants to be the agreed-upon beautiful thing.

Probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside
if not outside. You can create an excellent argument
for your being and improve upon ability. That is my opinion.
If you live alone, you may know how great the web can be.
On it there is information and pornography.
Information includes
the prospects.

Pornography is the biggest industry in America.
It is designed to bring about a certain state
of arousal, generally, couched in anger
that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to
without worrying about the one fucked.
Pornography is addictive for many.
Of course, sometimes people want to touch, to hear a voice

to imagine a partner and what they can do together.
The web has many dating services. My ex-psychiatrist
advised me against trying them.
She had transferred the daughter role onto me.
I do appreciate the dangers of strangers.
I am prepared with the information that pictures
are not people in both obvious and non-obvious ways.

I know at least three people who have been in love
with people they met online.
Each one is intelligent and down-to-earth.
I’ve gleaned from their descriptions of online courting
that the early questions are essential.
That and no expectation and somehow you have
to withhold your own personal information.

That is, until you meet up in a non-threatening place.
You will have to have someone know where you are,
a point person. And you will need a defense; mace, for instance
or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby
or in the car.
It will be important for him or her to know you have a dog.
They should meet each other as soon as possible.

This is the magic of the machine.
The meeting and love trial and,
if it works, the love made.
Well, that really is amazing.
Objectively amazing.
And good for the machine.
Good for the machine.

The electric web courses heavily through me.
This may be how we make history:
we can put up our movies, our words, or costume dramas.
We say we are so and so
and people follow the saga.
Do you ever get the problem which is opposite
to the problem of the watcher?

Have you ever only seen yourself through other people?
Or thought that’s what it was but it was really your
thought processes transferred through them?
I should look up the word rubric again.
That and lacuna and devi.
In the thrift store nobody looked at me.
But the woman said, “Devi (hee, hee) Devi.”

A celestial being: what we all are.
True she might have meant devil.
I am not a devil.
I love my friends most of the time.
I love animals—I don’t think devils do that.
My friend sends me pictures
of jackrabbits and frogs.

Yesterday, he said he saw buttercups, a type of flower.
You go over the tracks first, on the other side of the river

and there they are."

1491,No Promissory Notes,Ish Klein,"The word penis is probably the most misattributed word in
English, I think. Because almost nobody has a real one.
The standards are made in Japanese or German factories.

Womb/vagina sets are unusual too if genuine.
Standards are from China; they are recycled sheepskin wallets.
I was shocked too when I heard this.

I do not have an actual either but they called
me a genius when I figured it out about the fetal
lamb/sheep skin. What else to do with all the wallets

now that there’s no money? Only barter.
I do not know what the inside of this thing looks like
but I think it looks like a brain made of mozzarella cheese.

Standard penises are made of a certain kind of plant.
An ocean weed and how it’s fitted is by body weight
at birth which is why you shouldn’t smoke

if you are pregnant, you will be blamed
even though it’s complicated to know exact reasons
as we all in the new world know better each day.

They’ve made new lingo to go with the genuine penis.
They say unicorn, I say wasabi.
Apparently, almost everyone gets green horseradish with sushi.

Wasabi takes several million years to grow,
its taste is delicate. When I mentioned Japan
earlier, I meant the motor city.

When I say Wasabi near Japan; it’s island
of slow unit dance or Remarkable Mask.
When I say new world, it’s where the newly suited go.

T-cell robots, we of lambs and plants and jellyfish that are
in our eyes which are colored by their place in the ocean.
Really, if you broke us down, you’d have quite a collection:

resins from pine, precious stones,
silver dust, and sea grass filaments,
stalks, pig livers, skin, a milk protein.

This is the equipment for the dominant standard penis holders
of the unreal, and I would love to be one with a genuine
but I have not the stomach to pull off the cunning necessary

for the genuine purse/penis license.
You barter for it; you lie.
Don’t get me wrong, it must be nice

to have options. But to get them dishonestly?
It’s bothering. I know, I know!
I have got to say goodbye to the babyhood phase.

Learn to thrive! Nobody has a father or a mother.
I know this means to thrive!
To be one’s own lover.

My sheepskin wallet is . . .
What could a person say? Stuck in the past,
tripped up by the concept of wallet?

It’s not like anything gets taken out
unless it’s rotten which it probably isn’t
because I feel okay and you look alright.

It’s that it wants to be ultimate although
a new and genuine vagina/womb set from a biped
has not been recorded in over 180 years

which means billions of here/now moments.
Which means forgotten a trillion times
and remembered exactly one plus that.

There’s not as much empty space as we thought
in the old blueprints that made donuts
in space—the halo, the Homeric lure.

The one electron penis and the drone.
I’ve been sick and found all this out because I couldn’t
get out of bed and there was a diamond near my head.

I was reading about moray eels,
their hydraulics. How they practically
fly-fish with agility.

It’s the forward going.
I’d like to go boldly.
I’ve kept a card of energy.

Wilderness saved from childhood.
Of this secret, one must be silent
so the sun can trust us.

Kids need each other.
Better they never get
separated entirely.

Contra this, I do want to fly fish.
To cast off and plant it then go with
the nylon line. Where to take off

the old wallet and give it back
to a lamb. I’ll be the promo homo
making arrangements to go to the show

where we trade our new pieces congenially
and find others, depleted by scavengers,
and get them up-and-running to better suns,

not the promised land, exactly
the opposite. Exactly the opposite
of anything promised."
1492,September,Joanne Kyger,"The grasses are light brown

                               Strangely, it was not my desire

that bade me speak in church to be released
         but memory of the way it used to be in
careless and exotic play

               when characters were promises
      then recognitions.  The world of transformation
is real and not real but trusting.

                            Enough of these lessons?  I mean
didactic phrases to take you in and out of
love’s mysterious bonds?

                      Well I myself am not myself

           and which power of survival I speak
for is not made of houses.

          It is inner luxury, of golden figures
that breathe like mountains do
            and whose skin is made dusky by stars."
1493,The Test of Fantasy,Joanne Kyger,"1.

It unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward.  All the stories
come folding out.  The smells and flowers begin to come back, as
the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded.  Rabbits and violets.

Who asked you to come over?  She got her foot in the door and
would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly.  Gas leak?
that sounds like a very existential position; perhaps you had
better check with the landlord.

                                                            This was no better than the
predicament I had just read about.  Now it was actually changing
before my eyes.  Sometimes it will come to a standstill though,
and finally the reflection can begin.

Selfless—that was the proposition.  Smiling and moving instantly
there was no other purpose than that which brought them there,
to be in a particular place.

2.

This time the mule gave its face away.  Take your cadillac
where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be,
and enjoy a good bottle of rum.

Running on this way she used various modes of expression that
were current.  Nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.
What Woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the
woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility
of her mind.  At the Philadelphia Flower Show, an ideal situation
was built up.  Here through various regulated artificial conditions,
spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed
her ideal concept of nature.  The smell was overpowering.

All right then.  She had a thing about nature, from flower
show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.

A beauty of cultivation—in living?  Hastiness did not prevent
her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd
conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, “OH OH
the life I am entangled in.”  Four sides of it.

                                                                                        Above was a paradisical
level, incompleted.  With working possibilities.

Below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.
Currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new
bedspread and color scheme for pillows.

                                                                               Taste treats were
unresponsive.  Glamor do’s were out.  Conversation was nil.
Languid

she could not even find a place to languish upon that was
fulfilling in its own way.

                            So out of the lifelessness that was around her,
the grape leaves drying out, and even though the avocado was
sprouting,

she thought, Why not fantasy?  Tugging at this character and
that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-
blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller.  Here the four
walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again.  “I ought
to tighten down and make sure I say exactly what I mean.”

And her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch
economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way.  Use every
tidbit, usefully.  Once upon a time there was a princess who
had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the
coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.
The princess languished.  She was not sure where to sit to her best
advantage to enjoy herself the most.  She could not go in her mind
or out.  She looked at her long white hand, I am the Queen of the
High Mountain Hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was
a princess.  She lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of
eden, the coat spread around her.

                                                                No, that poor little house she
had built was a bore.  It’s better that it go up in flames, as it did.

She went down to Grand Central Station and gave away flowers.
Some people took them and some people didn’t.

3.

I’m glad to get back.  I had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.
Questioning myself all along the way.  Was I jumping on her because
her time had come to an end.  Indeed I pounded on his arm all night,
over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, I can see nothing
but their softness.  Me ME, and the time we might spend together,
reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.

My flippancy is gone.  Now I have started my secret life again,
in transition, reminding.  As the moth reminds, its feeble antenna
groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.

All over I was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.
It was a cold night out.  It was colder still between the airy gaps,
between blankets.

                                     You can see she is thoughtful
as she draws the string to the bow.  Where to go indeed.  The
point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.

A sleeping angel or a sleeping troll?  I was rather proud of being
used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown
street.  Here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,
drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what I owed.
It was a lot, if I hesitated.  I choose to go on, saying this is the
way I go, owing nothing, being that kind of person.  Hung up?

That thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly
marked.  Certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential
core of feeling blooms in each encounter.  Lost under the weight
of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.
Thus unhappy, I don’t want it to be this way, and so forth.
Not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.

4.

We of course are in a family situation.  Anything I wish might
happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be
considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality
they possessed.

In the snow, the wood piled up underneath.  Oh those drifting
sensibilities.  At this point it is scarcely believable that people
gather and like each other.  Eating chocolate pudding, getting
in touch with some other sense of alikeness.  The form is no
longer obvious to me.  Whether they meander or are joined together
in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.

                                                     I suspect that in this house, this
place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is
no real fear; the objects are old and I am not familiar with them,
only the sense that the Ghost or spirit world strikes you with
its familiarity, pleasurable fear.

                                                           Here the familiar
is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected
lurk in the hall, into the room.  Pieces of leather, old silken fans
laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly
terror is the wrong combination of ignorance.  It contains its own
self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe.  100 pieces of voice
with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the
soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as—
I am never sure; Oh it’s that power

and disease of believing in the stale that doesn’t demand a real
climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.

5.

The night passes in night time.  The head moving to the shoulder,
the head rising with a frown.

In a firm voice, it doesn’t matter if the hair is flying from undue
spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces
appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a
lovely way to be rid of waste.

However, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have
fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which
refuses to sink.

                                                                                  There once was a woman
who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was
always constant.  Why does one have to contend with that she said,
puzzled, as she got carried along, and constantly had to think up
new coping modes of behavior.  If he behaved to me thus when he was
40, now that I am 30, I can hardly behave like that to those that are
20, and so forth.  There wasn’t any model except the one she built,
and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern.  This
offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.

6.

You can’t see them, all bundled up, all those that choose
to move other than where the distance seems appealing.  Knowledge
has no depth.  There isn’t any message to be spoken.

Wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no
point in laying its head down.  She ought to watch carefully.

                                                                             The claws.  It could be
the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the
rose, doesn’t make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.
What could it be all about?  The necessity to follow, balancing,
contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.

Just a little touch.  The leader cautioned further progression.
I could hardly listen to the music for long.  Now there
seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing
definite, of a fragmented nature.

                                                               Certainly I wished the best
for all.  The sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as I also in the
profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the
twisting statements grooving into the language building something
to listen to.  The dress made from silk.  Trusting was awkward
and not of a nature to ease any further building.  Whosoever
you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the
burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of
communication.

7.

I am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort.  However, as
dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from
a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.

Knowledge comes from what purported strike?  From that which cleanses,
and let us knot say “heart” but tissue.  Hopefully and helpfully I have
built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep.  Not for purposes
of letting in the cold.

                                         However, I have found that not all blockaded
against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless
realm of the mushroom.  As much can be denied as the bilious sun
strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and
the head.  That is uncorraled ecstasy.  I call it enthusiasm, free energy.
But it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused; it is a real force
and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.

                                                                              As the pieces of the house
ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks.  Whether or
not to join in what I was half committed to see and do.

8.

At this point, when Jack picked up the pussy willow branches, I said
they can’t possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication
to an older Con Edison man.  The buildings were like the unexplored
garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth
from boxes left overnight.  Energy as limitless possibility, in
the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.

For example, if once I stop to realize what little gets through, I am
much more interested in the cover than the contents; it is difficult
to find any interest in anything.  Good energy displaces bad karma.
And other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own
place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed
fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations
between.

                    As I saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, I
forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from
something I have never seen; more possibly the components of what
every man views.  If this was a possibility, the rays from every person
converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without
any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between
the fifth and sixth rung.  This is the way people glow and pulse similar
to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life; until
I who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be
blocked on the way, although I turn back gladly, and will again swim
through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting’s compounded measure
is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths
calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition
or orifices, stomachs and legs.

I reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing
themselves.  She ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but
fuller.  Did you forget to wax and wane?  Her head was full of energy
brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious
into color, but no sense.  Sense was for the thinkers.  Here the thinkers
forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee,
and those off worse could smoke.

                                                                                          I had felt very
foolish when I leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and
his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the
way.  And I followed for certainly no one would follow me.  As the day
is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and
nature.  These words, like Nature, and Head, Thinking and Words,
repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off
sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition.  Light

was such an enormous possibility.  Taking sight into a frenzy, it was
possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for
ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street
where cars had gone by.

                                                  I worried about certain characters: ones
that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but I was drawn to
them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?
As when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became
distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled
with the stuff of continuity.  The sorrow that each day sinks into the
infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and
does its rituals.  Memory has its own screen across the room to view
itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form
in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.

                                                                  New York. January – March, 1967"
1494,Trophies,Robert Fernandez,"I


How can we accommodate these reforms? The nights of bell-flowers are as finished as the hell of water that has unrolled and become news. Pull at the ox’s ring and the wall of the sinuses falls down. Pull at the hoop in the eyelid, dormitories are felled. A marriage of fists and kites, the smile is hammered so painstakingly into the gut it forms a ring.


II


I am staring up at a boxing match in which white Everlasts and red Everlasts take on the breakneck speed of cupids. Art Deco façades hem in the open-air courtyard; a black belt of skyline circles off their incandescent white waists. The sunrise pulls level with the sea. The boxers’ shadows furl and unfurl, drawing into cups.

You open your heart’s wings like a bread riot, split the uncooked potatoes on the table with a glance, and eat. You make the hours work like fragile perceptions for the food they get, the warmth they get, for the variable, contradictory spontaneities imposed on their bodies as love or triumph in mistaken assertions."
1495,Woman Feeding Chickens,Roy Scheele,"Her hand is at the feedbag at her waist,
sunk to the wrist in the rustling grain
that nuzzles her fingertips when laced
around a sifting handful. It’s like rain,
like cupping water in your hand, she thinks,
the cracks between the fingers like a sieve,
except that less escapes you through the chinks
when handling grain. She likes to feel it give
beneath her hand’s slow plummet, and the smell,
so rich a fragrance she has never quite
got used to it, under the seeming spell
of the charm of the commonplace. The white
hens bunch and strut, heads cocked, with tilted eyes,
till her hand sweeps out and the small grain flies."
1496,The Obvious Tradition,Bill Berkson,"I haven’t remembered anything, only the names
and that their dates have been replaced by fees
toted up out of mischief:
a whopping yellow sun, finesse swallowed hard,
a scrapbook in pantyhose dawdling beside some Shreveport-like expanse.
 
But now you see it, she’s supposed to call.
Surely neither will converse, they merely tell,
succumbing to a disorderly shelf life like Tampax in June.
Salute the budding terminus where the East Side was.
Can there be a way to redefine the tense behind its jaunts,
the pubescent imagery a hand calls forth
as, rippling, it is thrust into the brine?
 
                                      The phantom tugboat slips along
in depths past Garbo’s awnings and the united glaze
which wilts, harnessing dim signatories in the windows’ sarong.
Do things go further in need as I could? Or are they immune?
How else have I been taught to guess
and then been told to know, because matter equals good?
A silken light masks the entrance to the market proofs of time."
1497,Mockingbird,Judith Harris,"I can hear him,
now, even in darkness,
a trickster under the moon,
bristling his feathers,
sounding as merry
as a man whistling in a straw hat,
or a squeaky gate
to the playground, left ajar
or the jingling of a star,
having wandered too far
from the pasture."
1498,Potato Soup,Daniel Nyikos,"I set up my computer and webcam in the kitchen
so I can ask my mother’s and aunt’s advice
as I cook soup for the first time alone.
My mother is in Utah. My aunt is in Hungary.
I show the onions to my mother with the webcam.
“Cut them smaller,” she advises.
“You only need a taste.”
I chop potatoes as the onions fry in my pan.
When I say I have no paprika to add to the broth,
they argue whether it can be called potato soup.
My mother says it will be white potato soup,
my aunt says potato soup must be red.
When I add sliced peppers, I ask many times
if I should put the water in now,
but they both say to wait until I add the potatoes.
I add Polish sausage because I can’t find Hungarian,
and I cook it so long the potatoes fall apart.
“You’ve made stew,” my mother says
when I hold up the whole pot to the camera.
They laugh and say I must get married soon.
I turn off the computer and eat alone."
1499,Behind the Plow,Leo Dangel,"I look in the turned sod
for an iron bolt that fell
from the plow frame
and find instead an arrowhead
with delicate, chipped edges,
still sharp, not much larger
than a woman’s long fingernail.
Pleased, I put the arrowhead
into my overalls pocket,
knowing that the man who shot
the arrow and lost his work
must have looked for it
much longer than I will
look for that bolt."
1500,Bonsai at the Potter's Stall,Kay Mullen,"Under fluorescent light,
aligned on a bench

and table top, oranges
the size of marbles dangle

from trees with glossy
leaves. White trumpets

bloom in tiny clay pots.
Under a firethorn’s twisted

limbs, a three inch monk
holds a cup from which

he appears to drink
the interior life. The potter

prizes his bonsai children
who will never grow up,

never leave home."
1501,Tonight,Ladan Osman,"Tonight is a drunk man,
his dirty shirt.

There is no couple chatting by the recycling bins,
offering to help me unload my plastics.

There is not even the black and white cat
that balances elegantly on the lip of the dumpster.

There is only the smell of sour breath. Sweat on the collar of my shirt.
A water bottle rolling under a car.
Me in my too-small pajama pants stacking juice jugs on neighbors’ juice jugs.

I look to see if there is someone drinking on their balcony.

I tell myself I will wave."
1502,An Offering for Patricia,Anthony Hecht,"The work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty, chiefly because I cannot concentrate. I have no feeling about whether what I am writing is good or bad, and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me. And I am sure I know the reason. It’s that I can’t stand leaving unresolved my situation with Pat. I hear from her fairly frequently, asking when I plan to come back, and she knows that I am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of January. It is not mainly loneliness I feel, though I feel it; but I have been lonely before. It is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us, and that in the mean time I worry about how things are going to work out. This has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before.

 – From a letter to his parents dated November 9, 1955, Rome.

Hardly enough for me that the pail of water
              Alive with the wrinkling light
              Brings clearness home and whiter
Than mind conceives the walls mature to white,
Or that the washed tomatoes whose name is given
              To love fulfill their bowl
              And the Roman sea is woven
Together by threading fish and made most whole.

I delight in each of these, delight moreover
              In the dark skill of those hands
              Closer to wise than clever
Of our blind Italian landlady who stands
Her shoes fouled with the lustful blood of rabbit
              Lightly dispatched and dressed
              Fixing it to the gibbet
Of the clothesline where the laundry sails to rest.

These textures solicit of us our instant homage
              But are disparate senseless things
              Unless a reigning image
Bring them to purpose as your presence brings
The world in offering, like a chaplet worn
              In Aphrodite’s name,
              The furious unicorn
Come to the virgin’s lap tethered and tame.

And thus it is as you stand in this morning’s shadows
              Where ancient chamber pots
              Are grown to little meadows
Of mint and parsley; surely it’s love unknots
The winds for Ulysses and recalls to man
              A summer without cease;
              Sprung from the same dishpan
Onion and lily work their primal peace."
1503,Anatomy of Melancholy,Robert Wrigley,"Lucy Doolin, first day on the job, stroked his goatee
and informed the seven of us in his charge
his name was short for Lucifer, and that his father, a man
he never knew, had been possessed,
as his mother had told him, of both an odd sense of humor
and a deep and immitigable bitterness. Also 
that the same man had named Lucy’s twin brother,
born dead, Jesus Christ. These facts, he said,
along with his tattoos and Mohawked black hair,
we should, in our toils on his behalf, remember.

As we should also always remember to call him
only by that otherwise most womanly diminutive,
and never, he warned, by his given nor surname,
least of all with the title “Mister” attached,
which would remind him of that same most hated father
and plunge him therefore into a mood
he could not promise he would, he said, “behave 
appropriately within.” Fortunately, our job,
unlike the social difficulties attached thereto,
was simple: collect the trash from the county’s back roads.

Although, given Lucy’s insistence on thoroughness,
this meant not only beer cans and bottles,
all manner of cast-off paper and plastics, but also
the occasional condom too, as well as the festering
roadkill fresh and ridden with maggotry,
or desiccate and liftable only from the hot summer tar
with a square-bladed shovel, all of which was to be tossed
into the bed of the township flatbed truck we ourselves
rode to and from the job in. By fifty-yard increments
then we traveled. He was never not smoking a cigarette.

Late every afternoon, at the dump, while we unloaded
our tonnage of trash, he sat with Stump McCarriston,
sexton of the dump and the dump’s constant resident,
in the shade, next to a green, decrepit trailer
we marveled at and strangely envied, since every inch
of wall we could see through the open door
was plastered with fold-outs and pages
from every Stump-salvaged Playboy and nudie magazine
he had ever found among the wreckage there.
Stump, we understood, was the ugliest man on earth.

Even had Lucy not told us so, we would have known,
by the olfactory rudeness within twenty yards
of his hovel, that he never bathed. And once,
while we shoveled and scraped, he took up the .22
from the rack beside his door and popped
with amazing accuracy three rats not fifty feet from us,
then walked to their carcasses, skinned them out,
and hung their hides on a scavenged grocery store rack
to dry. He was making, Lucy explained, a rat hide
coat we could see, come the fall, except for school.

As for school, it was a concept Stump could not fathom
and Lucy had no use for, on the truck’s dash
all that summer Robert Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy,
a tome he said he’d read already eleven times,
this summer being the twelfth. We thought, in some way,
it might have had to do with something like the gallery
Stump’s trailer contained, the first word of its title
meaning something to us, the last nothing at all.
There were things about men we might be
unable ever to know, which we somehow knew was lucky.

And Lucky, incidentally, was the name of the cat,
fat and mangy, that, once Stump was back in the shade
with Lucy, began, one by one, to consume the hideless rats.
The town we came from was sinking into the emptiness
of a thousand abandoned coal mine shafts beneath it,
and rats were more common than hares
and universally despised. They shamed us, it seemed,
as we were shamed by ignorance and curiosity—
the bodies of those women on the walls, the provenance
of rats the very earth offered up like a plague,

the burden of a name like Lucifer or Stump,
whose name, as it was scrawled on his mailbox,
seemed to be Stumplin Reilly McCarriston, Esquire.
Of the seven of us, one would die in Vietnam,
one, after medical school, would hang himself
from a beam in his parents’ basement, the others
merely gone, vanished in actuality if not in memory.
Leaving me, alone, to tell this story. How Stump
would spend his last twenty years in prison,
having shot Lucy—one slender, flattening .22 slug

through the forehead—as he stood fifty feet away, 
balanced atop the tub of an ancient wringer washer,
arms extended, like Jesus Christ, said Stump,
whose trailer was bulldozed into the dump itself
even before the trial, and who, no doubt, by some
court-appointed lawyer if not the appalled sheriff himself,
was forced to bathe and shave, to step into the unknown country
of a scentless white shirt and black businessman’s trousers,
in order to offer his only yet most sincere defense,
that Lucifer—Mr. Doolin, as the court insisted—had told him to."
1504,Apocrypha,Peter Gizzi,"Wisdom is a kindly spirit
 but does it love me? And righteousness? There’s nothing in it.

To poetry I leave my senses, my deregulation, custodial duties, and to be a janitor is a great consolation.
It gave me my mother back through all her years.
To love these children, so full of neurons and consciousness. What joy to clean up and put a shine on their mess.
To my mother I leave my veil, my wing, the window and time. I, artifact. In this age the hand is a voice.
I leave the voice, the wonder, the mirror, and my lens, bent and beholden to the worm, leaf-work in wrought iron, eerie illuminations and deep-sea vision.
I’ve seen the Eurostar, the drunken boat, and Davy Jones’ Locker. I’ve seen Spanish galleons and the H.S. Mauberley covered in brine.
There is this line from cloud dander to the solo bulb of mourning, a string through common prayer.
I like it when the gray-green shadows suddenly dayglo over the rushes. The wind in my head.
To write is an equal and opposite reaction my comrade, communard, my friendo.
What is it finally thinking what in winter’s dusty alcove, the body tocks. The day was cloudy. The light muddy, dreary when they took it down.
To Times Roman I give my stammer, my sullenness, my new world violence, form and all that, forms, and all that paper, gusts. Little buttress.     
I send love and weapons to everyone possessed with night visions.
When those green lights flash and blink, is that it? When the “it” continues strangely for a bit, then falls into a line, is it over?
I quantified daily the wonder in the grain.
I found I was over and singular yet many, the many and the singular, the many and the evolutionary, the many in the grain. Many more.
Who in hell am I writing for?
This vision is silly, teenage, and mine, a spot on the negative, a hole in composition. I quantify, I loaf, I wonder, I find, I rev.    
Here the days’ mud, night is a satellite, and anger, my cleft, my birthmark and star.
Anger might be a better way to say “I love you,” truer than “how are you in space”? Are you cold, can I get you a blanket?
To the polestar I leave my alien regalia, my off-world headdress. I leave acoustic forms in time, blooming, sudsy, inconsolable.
If you are unsatisfied, then welcome.    
Here there are people working every corner of every inch of grass. The meticulously arranged outside reminds me of ocean and feels old.
In space the letterforms “I love” oscillate in waves.
I lose myself in waves speaking the half of me that forgot to say “goodbye” when I meant to say “how come.”
Memory continues to bloom. More songs about death and dying, songs of inexperience.
More songs about being and loss, being in loss, more songs about seeing and feeling.
If you are critical, all the better to see and to miss it, to misunderstand, to fail at empathy and love, to not understand love and to love, to be diseverything and to love, whatever.
To mercy I leave whatever."
1505,Card 19: The Sun,Brenda Shaughnessy,"When you show yourself to the woman 
you love, you don’t know your fear

is not fear, itself. You have never been good,
but now you are so good,

who are you? Is it the liquidity of her skin
that bathes the world for you,

or her face, captured like a she-lion
in your own flesh?

This summerbed is soft with ring upon ring 
upon ring of wedding, the kind

that doesn’t clink upon contact, the kind
with no contract,

the kind in which the gold is only (only!) light. 
Cloud covers and lifts, 

and sleep and night and soon enough, love’s
big fire laughs at a terrible burn, 

but only (only!) because pain absorbs excess 
joy and you shouldn’t flaunt 

your treasures in front of all day’s eyes."
1506,Dilemma,Anthony Hecht,"“Dark and amusing he is, this handsome gallant,
           Of chamois-polished charm,
Athlete and dancer of uncommon talent—
           Is there cause for alarm
In his smooth demeanor, the proud tilt of his chin,
           This cavaliere servente, this Harlequin?

“Gentle and kindly this other, ardent but shy,
           With an intelligence
Who would not glory to be guided by—
           And would it not make sense
To trust in someone so devoted, so
           Worshipful as this tender, pale Pierrot?

“Since both of them delight, if I must choose
           I win a matchless mate,
But by that very winning choice I lose—
           I pause, I hesitate,
Putting decision off,” says Columbine,
“And while I hesitate, they both are mine.”"
1507,Draw Near,Scott Cairns,"προσέλθετε

For near is where you’ll meet what you have wandered 
far to find. And near is where you’ll very likely see 
how far the near obtains. In the dark katholikon
the lighted candles lent their gold to give the eye
a more than common sense of what lay flickering
just beyond the ken, and lent the mind a likely
swoon just shy of apprehension. It was then
that time’s neat artifice fell in and made for us
a figure for when time would slip free altogether.
I have no sense of what this means to you, so little
sense of what to make of it myself, save one lit glimpse 
of how we live and move, a more expansive sense in Whom."
1508,The Farmer,W.D. Ehrhart,"Each day I go into the fields
to see what is growing
and what remains to be done.
It is always the same thing: nothing
is growing, everything needs to be done.
Plow, harrow, disc, water, pray
till my bones ache and hands rub
blood-raw with honest labor—
all that grows is the slow
intransigent intensity of need.
I have sown my seed on soil
guaranteed by poverty to fail.
But I don’t complain—except
to passersby who ask me why
I work such barren earth.
They would not understand me
if I stooped to lift a rock
and hold it like a child, or laughed,
or told them it is their poverty
I labor to relieve. For them,
I complain. A farmer of dreams
knows how to pretend. A farmer of dreams
knows what it means to be patient.
Each day I go into the fields.

1509,The Flurry,Sharon Olds,"When we talk about when to tell the kids,
we are so together, so concentrated.
I mutter, “I feel like a killer.” “I’m
the killer”—taking my wrist—he says,
holding it. He is sitting on the couch, 
the old indigo chintz around him, 
rich as a night sea with jellies, 
I am sitting on the floor. I look up at him,
as if within some chamber of matedness,
some dust I carry around me. Tonight,
to breathe its Magellanic field is less
painful, maybe because he is drinking
a wine grown where I was born—fog,
eucalyptus, sempervirens—and I’m
sharing the glass with him. “Don’t catch
my cold,” he says, “—oh that’s right, you want
to catch my cold.” I should not have told him that,
I tell him I will try to fall out of 
love with him, but I feel I will love him
all my life. He says he loves me
as the mother of our children, and new troupes
of tears mount to the acrobat platforms
of my ducts and do their burning leaps.
Some of them jump straight sideways, and, for a
moment, I imagine a flurry
of tears like a whirra of knives thrown
at a figure, to outline it—a heart’s spurt 
of rage. It glitters, in my vision, I nod
to it, it is my hope."
1510,"“For you: anthophilous, lover of flowers”",Reginald Dwayne Betts,"For you: anthophilous, lover of flowers, 
green roses, chrysanthemums, lilies: retrophilia, 
philocaly, philomath, sarcophilous—all this love,
of the past, of beauty, of knowledge, of flesh; this is
catalogue & counter: philalethist, negrophile, neophile.
A negro man walks down the street, taps Newport
out against a brick wall & stares at you. Love 
that: lygophilia, lithophilous. Be amongst stones,
amongst darkness. We are glass house. Philopornist,
philotechnical. Why not worship the demimonde?
Love that—a corner room, whatever is not there, 
all the clutter you keep secret. Palaeophile,
ornithophilous: you, antiquarian, pollinated by birds.
All this a way to dream green rose petals on the bed you love; 
petrophilous, stigmatophilia: live near rocks, tattoo hurt;
for you topophilia: what place do you love? All these words 
for love (for you), all these ways to say believe 
in symphily, to say let us live near each other."
1511,The Fountain,Charles Baudelaire,"My dear, your eyes are weary;
Rest them a little while.
Assume the languid posture
Of pleasure mixed with guile.
Outside the talkative fountain
Continues night and day
Repeating my warm passion
In whatever it has to say.

             The sheer luminous gown
                           The fountain wears
             Where Phoebe’s very own
                           Color appears
             Falls like a summer rain
                           Or shawl of tears.

Thus your soul ignited
By pleasure’s lusts and needs
Sprays into heaven’s reaches
And dreams of fiery deeds.
Then it brims over, dying, 
And languorous, apart,
Drains down some slope and enters
The dark well of my heart.

             The sheer luminous gown
                           The fountain wears
             Where Phoebe’s very own
                           Color appears
             Falls like a summer rain
                           Or shawl of tears.

O you, whom night enhances,
How sweet here at your breasts
To hear the eternal sadness
Of water that never rests.
O moon, o singing fountain,
O leaf-thronged night above,
You are the faultless mirrors
Of my sweet, bitter love.

             The sheer luminous gown
                           The fountain wears
             Where Phoebe’s very own
                           Color appears
             Falls like a summer rain
                           Or shawl of tears."
1512,A Friend Killed in the War,Anthony Hecht,"Night, the fat serpent, slipped among the plants,
Intent upon the apples of his eyes;
A heavy bandoleer hung like a prize
Around his neck, and tropical red ants
Mounted his body, and he heard advance,
Little by little, the thin female cries
Of mortar shells. He thought of Paradise.
Such is the vision that extremity grants.

In the clean brightness of magnesium
Flares, there were seven angels by a tree.
Their hair flashed diamonds, and they made him doubt
They were not really from Elysium.
And his flesh opened like a peony,
Red at the heart, white petals furling out."
1513,Head Handed,Brenda Shaughnessy,"Stop belonging to me so much, face-head.
Leave me to my child and my flowers.

I can’t run with you hanging on to me like that.
It’s like having ten dogs on a single lead

and no talent for creatures.
No hands, no trees. Not my dogs, nobody’s.

Don’t you have a place to go, face-head? 
Deep into the brick basement of another life? 

To kill some time, I mean. That furnace 
light could take a shine to you. 

There are always places, none of them mine. 
And always time—rainbow sugar show 

of jimmies falling from ice cream’s sky—
but that stuff’s extra, it’s never in supply. 

“Never,” however, acres of it. Violet beans 
and sarcasm. Too many flavors of it. 

All those prodigal particles, 
flimsily whimsical miracles, an embarrassment 

of glitches. The chorus just more us. 
But nowhere bare and slippery have I 

got a prayer. If I had two hands 
to rub together I wouldn’t waste the air."
1514,Mathematics Considered as a Vice,Anthony Hecht,"I would invoke that man
Who chipped for all posterity an ass
             (The one that Jesus rode)
Out of hard stone, and set its either wing
Among the wings of the most saintly clan
On Chartres Cathedral, and that it might sing
             The praise to all who pass
             Of its unearthly load,
Hung from its neck a harp-like instrument.
             I would invoke that man
             To aid my argument.

             The ass smiles on us all,
Being astonished that an ass might rise
             To such sure eminence
Not merely among asses but mankind,
Simpers, almost, upon the western wall
In praise of folly, who midst sow and kine,
             Saw with its foolish eyes
             Gold, Myrrh, and Frankincense
Enter the stable door, against all odds.
             The ass smiles on us all.
             Our butt at last is God’s.

             That man is but an ass—
More perfectly, that ass is but a man
             Who struggles to describe
Our rich, contingent and substantial world
In ideal signs: the dunged and pagan grass,
Misted in summer, or the mother-of-pearled
             Home of the bachelor-clam.
             A cold and toothless tribe
Has he for brothers, who would coldly think.
             That man is but an ass
             Who smells not his own stink.

             For all his abstract style
Speaks not to our humanity, and shows
             Neither the purity
Of heaven, nor the impurity beneath,
And cannot see the feasted crocodile
Ringed with St. Francis’ birds to pick its teeth,
             Nor can his thought disclose
             To normal intimacy,
Siamese twins, the double-beasted back,
             For all his abstract style
             Utters our chiefest lack.

             Despite his abstract style,
Pickerel will dawdle in their summer pools
             Lit by the flitterings
Of light dashing the gusty surfaces,
Or lie suspended among shades of bile
And lime in fluent shift, for all he says.
             And all the grey-haired mules,
             Simple and neuter things,
Will bray hosannas, blessing harp and wing.
             For all his abstract style,
             The ass will learn to sing."
1515,Piano,Dan Howell,"Her wattled fingers can’t
stroke the keys with much
grace or assurance anymore,
and the tempo is always
rubato, halting, but still
that sound—notes quivering
and clear in their singularity,
filing down the hallway—
aches with pure intention, the
melody somehow prettier
as a remnant than
whatever it used to be."
1516,Pietà,Kevin Young,"I hunted heaven
for him.

No dice.

Too uppity,
it was. Not enough

music, or dark dirt.

I begged the earth empty
of him. Death

believes in us whether
we believe

or not. For a long while
I watch the sound

of a boy bouncing a ball
down the block

take its time
to reach me. Father,

find me when
you want. I’ll wait."
1517,The Plate,Anthony Hecht,"Now he has silver in him. When sometime
Death shall boil down unnecessary fat
To reach the nub of our identity,
             When in the run of crime
The skull is rifled for the gold in teeth,
And chemistry has eaten from the spine
Superfluous life and vigor, why then he
Will show a richness to be wondered at,
             And shall be thought a mine
Whose claim and stake are stone and floral wreath.

The body burns away, and burning gives
Light to the eye and moisture to the lip
And warmth to our desires, but it burns
             Whatever body lives
Into extinction though it wear a plate
Of armor in it: therefore do we thrive
In fear of fire, in terror of the ship
That carries us to fire. A soldier learns
             To bear the silver weight
Where in his head the fire is most alive."
1518,Shalimar,Mary Ruefle,"God put his finger on my sacrum
and he lifted me, he set me
in the center of the universe,
the curious desire
of my chronically lonely life.

It was cold and dark and lonely
and I was scared.

There were no accessories.
I burst into tears over nothing.

What would Jimmy Schuyler do?
wwjsd?

And as quietly as the sound of Kleenex
being pulled from a box,
I sneezed.

And morning, that goddess,
as if she were slightly deaf,
barely lifted her head off the horizon
before laying back down.

And a rose opened her portals
and the scent ran up an elephant’s trunk,
or tried to.

Such a long way for everything to travel!

From here I look like a front moving in

An icy purple light
a poet would say belonged to a perfume stopper
belonging to his mother.
When it was her nipple.

You know, neither in the past
or in the future."
1519,Soundings,Robert Wrigley,"The birdhouse made from a gourd is wired
to a flanged loop of steel and screwed to the southeast post
of the shack. Two holes at the top—near where the stem was,
for a thong of leather to hang it by, which long ago broke—
are now the fingerholes of the mournful wind instrument it’s become.
The broad round bowl of it makes a sort of birdly
basso profundo that pearls through the steel, into the post,
the floor joists and walls in two notes: a slightly sharp D
and an equally sharp F, says the guitar tuner,
which explains why all my thinking these days
is in B-flat, a difficult key for all but the clarinet
and this sudden covey of nuthatches, whose collective woe
makes it a minor chord I am in the middle of.
Nothing to do but hoist such silks as the luff
of limbs and needles suggests, and sail on,
the barely-escaped-from-the-cat chipmunk chattering
like a gull, and the mountain’s last drift of snow
resembling the back of a sounding whale. Hear the thrum of the rigging,
Daggoo? Hear its profoundest woo, its sensible gobbledy-goo
and doo-wop, the boo-hoos of the spheres, by vectors and veers,
by tacks and refractal jabberings, taking us deeper into the weirdness
of the ghost sea those prairie hills were the bottom of once,
this nowhere we shall not be returning from.
Draw the lines! Assume the crow’s nest, Pip. This ship
sails on music and wind, and away with birds."
1520,Under Beinn Ruadhainn,Robin Robertson,"For Andrew O’Hagan

Three moons in the sky
the night they found him
drowned in Sawtan’s Bog;
just his cap, sitting there
and his wee fat hands poking out.
It was no loss 
to the village, I told them 
next morning,
and the villagers agreed. 
Horn-daft, he was,
havering and glaikit
and scaring the children.
I mind that time
he picked up a mouse
and ate it, quick, 
in two mouthfuls;
set the tail aside
on the ground
like a cocktail stick.

I used her well, after that,
his Jennie,
still in her widow’s weeds,
gilping into her
whenever I could,
in the barn or the boathouse
or off in the fields.
She slipped two or three out at least,
and sank each one in a lobster creel.
Her head was away
by the end, as mad as her man
and no good to me.
She sleeps now 
under Beinn Ruadhainn, her face 
covered in ivy, 
scab, and sticky-willow.

The dreams came then.
Last night, the burning loch, 
so full of bairns
they bobbed to the surface 
with their hair on fire;
black snow; fingers 
coming through the floorboards;
rain like razor blades;
the foosty-faced man, 
there at every corner,
hands furred with grey-mould.
And her, as always, 
star-naked, hatching
in the herring-nets.
The last I remember 
was my body being driven
with sticks through the town
to Sawtan’s Brae, and hanged.

I broke from sleep and sat up sweating, 
dream-fleyed in the dark.
I groped around for the matches
and the matches were put in my hand."
1521,Visitor,Brenda Shaughnessy,"I am dreaming of a house just like this one

but larger and opener to the trees, nighter

than day and higher than noon, and you,

visiting, knocking to get in, hoping for icy

milk or hot tea or whatever it is you like. 

For each night is a long drink in a short glass. 

A drink of blacksound water, such a rush 

and fall of lonesome no form can contain it.

And if it isn’t night yet, though I seem to 

recall that it is, then it is not for everyone.

Did you receive my invitation? It is not 

for everyone. Please come to my house

lit by leaf light. It’s like a book with bright

pages filled with flocks and glens and groves

and overlooked by Pan, that seductive satyr

in whom the fish is also cooked. A book that 

took too long to read but minutes to unread—

that is—to forget. Strange are the pages 

thus. Nothing but the hope of company.

I made too much pie in expectation. I was 

hoping to sit with you in a tree house in a 

nightgown in a real way. Did you receive

my invitation? Written in haste, before 

leaf blinked out, before the idea fully formed.

An idea like a storm cloud that does not spill

or arrive but moves silently in a direction. 

Like a dark book in a long life with a vague

hope in a wood house with an open door."
1522,White Buttons,Mary Ruefle,"Having been blown away
by a book
I am in the gutter
at the end of the street
in little pieces
like the alphabet
(mother do not worry
letters are not flesh
though there’s meaning in them
but not when they are mean
my letters to you were mean
I found them after you died
and read them and tore them up
and fed them to the wind
thank you for intruding
I love you now leave)
Also at the end of the street
there is a magnolia tree
the white kind
that tatters
after it blooms
so the tree winds up
in the street
Our naked shivering bodies
must be at some distance
missing us    come back
come back they cry
come home
put down that book
whenever you read
you drift away on a raft
you like your parrot
more than you like me
and stuff like that
(dear father
you always were a bore
but I loved you more
than interesting things
and in your honor
I’ve felt the same about myself
and everyone I’ve ever met)
I like to read in tree houses
whenever I can    which is seldom
and sometimes never
The book that blew me away
held all the problems
of the world
and those of being alive
under my nose
but I felt far away from them
at the same time
reading is like that
(I am sorry I did not
go to your funeral
but like you said
on the phone
an insect cannot crawl
to China)
Here at the end of the street
the insects go on living
under the dome
of the pacific sky
If Mary and Joseph
had walked the sixty miles
to Bethlehem vertically
they would have found
themselves floating
in the outer pitch of space
it would have been cold
no inns
a long night
in the dark endless
and when they began to cry
the whole world would think
something had just been born
I like to read into things
as I am continually borne forward
in time by the winds like the snow
(dear sister
you were perfect in every way
like a baby
please tell brother
the only reason
we never spoke
was out of our great love
for each other
which made a big wind
that blew us apart)
I think I am coming back
I feel shoulders
where a parrot could land
though a tree would be
as good a place as any
You cannot teach a tree to talk
Trees can say    it is spring
but not    though bright sunlight
can also be very sad
have you noticed?"
1523,Women in Labor,Mary Ruefle,"Women who lie alone at midnight
because there is no one else to lie to

Women who lie alone at midnight
at noon in the laundromat
destroying their own socks

Women who lie alone at midnight:
Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates

Women who lie alone at midnight
as the first furl of starlight
pearls the moon with nacre

Women who lie alone at midnight
sending a postcard bearing
the face of a bawling infant
who cries “I am for the new”

Women who lie alone at midnight
reciting the names of shoes

Women who lie alone at midnight
spurting unjustified tears,
the kind that run sideways
never reaching the mouth,
the kind you cannot swallow

Women who lie alone at midnight
singing breast away the burden of my tender
and afterwards burp

Women who lie alone at midnight
obeying the laws of physics
Women who let their dreams curl at the end
Women in a monastery of flamingos

Women who die alone at midnight
contributing to the end, to 
lost time, to the rain and flies,
seeing the bird they saw trapped in the airport
surviving by the water fountain

What’s more, try it sometime
It works"

Just sign me: concerned."
1525,April Love﻿,Ernest Dowson,"We have walked in Love's land a little way,
 We have learnt his lesson a little while,
 And shall we not part at the end of day,
 With a sigh, a smile?
A little while in the shine of the sun,
 We were twined together, joined lips, forgot
 How the shadows fall when the day is done,
 And when Love is not.
We have made no vows--there will none be broke,
 Our love was free as the wind on the hill,
 There was no word said we need wish unspoke,
 We have wrought no ill.
So shall we not part at the end of day,
 Who have loved and lingered a little while,
 Join lips for the last time, go our way,
 With a sigh, a smile?

1526,Christmas Eve,Bill Berkson,"for Vincent Warren﻿

Behind the black water tower
under the grey
of the sky that feeds it
smoke speeds to where a pigeon
spreads its wings
 
This is no great feat
Cold pushes out its lust
We walk we drink we cast
our giggling insults
 
                           Would you please
leave the $2.50 you owe me
I would rather not talk about it
just now           Money bores me I would like
to visit someone who will stay
in bed all day           A forest is rising
imperceptibly in my head
                                                  not a civilized park
 
I think it would be nice this “new
moral odor” no it would not mean
“everything marching to its tomb”
                                                            The water tower

1529,January in Detroit or Search for Tomorrow Starring Ken and Ann,Ken Mikolowski,"I think it is interesting
though not exactly amusing
how we go from day to day
with no money. How do we
do it, friends ask, suspecting
we really have some stash
stacked away somewhere.
But we certainly do not
and we also do not know
how we do it either.
You sure are lucky,
some of our friends say. I am
none too sure of that though,
as I wait for the winning
lottery numbers to be announced
on CKLW. Thursday in Detroit
is the day of dreams. We have
been dreaming of a place
in the country lately and I’m
none too sure that is very healthy.
And speaking of health that’s
also been a problem that probably
has something to do with no money,
since we’ve all been sick lately,
taking turns politely of course.
Could you bring me some more
tea one of us will ask,
and the other will.
In between the coughing and
worrying our thoughts
have often turned to crime.
We seriously wonder how we can
get away with a bundle with
as little risk as possible.
Last week we took our last
$12 out of the bank
and noticed how much more
they had there though
we had none. Of course
we wouldn’t rob that bank,
they know us there
as the ones who bring
the rolls of pennies in.
And just yesterday they
fish-eyed us for trying
to cash our son’s xmas bond
from his grandparents
after only one month.
So we wouldn’t try to rob that bank,
but I do know of one up north
that may be possible. . .
I know this just seems like
romantic dreaming
but I practically make a career
of reading detective stories,
and God knows, I have no other.
Anyway if the right opportunity
comes along, we are more
than ready to meet it.
But this is a time of waiting,
the I Ching says, though it does
not say how we are to eat
while waiting. And soon
we will have another mouth to feed—
Ann now in her seventh month,
and that is often in our thoughts.
Besides all that we are both
over thirty, artist and poet,
still waiting to cross the great water.
Meanwhile, day after day,
there is still Detroit
to be dealt with — a small pond
says our friend Snee.
Big fish we used to answer him,
but that was a while back.
Now we think maybe Lake Erie
is the great water referred to
in the I Ching, and if we wait
long enough we can
walk across — to Buffalo
or Cleveland. In a healthy person,
says the philosopher, self-pity
can be a forerunner to action:
once the problem is seen clearly,
a solution may be found at hand.
And as I said, I think it is interesting
though not exactly amusing."
1530,Little or Nothing,Ken Mikolowski,"there are these trees.
and beyond these trees,
trees. and beyond that
little or nothing. little
fields and nothing but sky."
1532,October,Bill Berkson,"I
 
It’s odd to have a separate month. It
escapes the year, it is not only cold, it is warm
and loving like a death grip on a willing knee. The
Indians have a name for it, they call it:
“Summer!” The tepees shake in the blast like roosters
at dawn. Everything is special to them,
the colorful ones.

Somehow the housewife does not seem gentle.
Is she angry because her husband likes October?
Is it snow bleeds softly from her shoes?
The nest eggs have captured her,
but April rises from her bed.

“The beggars are upon us!” cried Chester.
 
Three strangers appeared at the door, demanding ribbons.
 
The October wind . . . nests

Why do I think October is beautiful?
It is not, is not beautiful.
                                                  But then
what is there to hold one’s interest
between the various drifts of a day’s
work, but to search out the differences
                                          the window and grate—
but it is not, is not
beautiful.
 
 
V
 
I think your face is beautiful, the way it is
close to my face, and I think you are the real
October with your transparence and the stone
of your words as they pass, as I do not hear them.

1533,Thuringian Equals,Bill Berkson,"Crossed fingers gird the planet, though small optimism obtains.
 
Will I read The Serious Doll in wraps, with its roller slur?
 
A book where everybody, reader and writer included, dies.
 
The kind of thing people said in the 1970s: “Hello, I’m back being me again.”
 
My first and last names and the first and last names of both my parents have the same number of letters.
 
The wasp waist, the tennis dress, the shirtwaist, the dirndl (Mainbocher).
 
A distant yet achingly distinct whinny: et voila! the walking buckboard.
 
Dustin Hoffman’s bookcase hanging by one hinge in air of Eleventh Street, dawn 1969.
 
Telephone solicitation for a ballet school in need of “serious floors.”
 
The thought of someone flat on his back on the carpet, tossing and giggling.
 
If it hurts don’t do it. (There are several unlesses to this caution.)
 
For the second time in two millennia slept through the meteor shower, results of last night’s talk."
1534,Variation,Bill Berkson,"Half-ended melodies are purer.
To no longer perform in broad daylight,
the apple’s a radish for it,
the winter chill a living thing.
But take your brother into later learning:
Let the girls who will smell the buried cloves there.
 
So I am only beginning to learn what I from time to time forget.
But throw away these childish things!
 
Barney’s coffin disappeared,

1535,Virgin Mule,Andrei Codrescu,"The conversations of the French
Quarter mules in their stables
after a full day of pulling
tourists and voters over cobble-
stones is not espresso witty
and in their dark no TVs feed
them news of the ends of mules
elsewhere in the Middle East
and West. In our stables the ends
of others are a fact of atmosphere.
The yoyos on the mystery island
nextdoor are revving familiar tools
in backyard now gripped by failure
first of electricity than of
a meaner something that’ll grow
into nothing we’ll know in the A.M.
Once they were visitors like us
then they grew mulish in their
bubbles and pulled whatever
was put around their necks in-
cluding a banner that said, About
What Kills Us We Know Little.
On certain nights after a good
internal fight we hear the voice-
less others through the glass
fearfully sweet’n’soft like dough.
Oh let the monsters in. Help us
rise above our not seeing them,
may they let us into their eyes
as well. Banish the blindness
of these cobblestones, clop, clop.
But! Pffsst! Our notes are in-
complete. Loving you was
never on the agenda. Better
to sing as roughly as the stones.
On Memorial Day we had one
thousand hotdogs & counting.
Didn’t visit a single graveyard.
We the Grant Wood folks scan
the sky for incoming missiles:
blips ourselves we understand
timing and touring in America.
The gilded dads in the portraits
sought the idealized continuity
now moving before us democratically
in showers of pixels and dots.
I’ll go with the distracted mariner,
my lover, and we’ll be in the world.
It will be late by then and dark.
We lyric virgin mules keep our
book of hours in a dream apart,
having stranded a billion turistas.
But we could not break the chummy hand.
Ready to brave the snow without a hat,
severe weather notwithstanding,
we merely nod and understand.

1536,April Midnight﻿,Arthur Symons,"Side by side through the streets at midnight,
Roaming together,
Through the tumultuous night of London,
In the miraculous April weather.
 
Roaming together under the gaslight,
Day’s work over,
How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,
Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!
 
Cool the wind blows, fresh in our faces,
Cleansing, entrancing,
After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,
Where you dance and I watch your dancing.
 
Good it is to be here together,
Good to be roaming,
Even in London, even at midnight,
Lover-like in a lover’s gloaming.
 
You the dancer and I the dreamer,
Children together,
Wandering lost in the night of London,
In the miraculous April weather.
﻿"
1537,Ode,Arthur O'Shaughnessy,"We are the music makers,
    And we are the dreamers of dreams,
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
    And sitting by desolate streams; —
World-losers and world-forsakers,
    On whom the pale moon gleams:
Yet we are the movers and shakers
    Of the world for ever, it seems.

With wonderful deathless ditties
We build up the world's great cities,
    And out of a fabulous story
    We fashion an empire's glory:
One man with a dream, at pleasure,
    Shall go forth and conquer a crown;
And three with a new song's measure
    Can trample a kingdom down.

We, in the ages lying,
    In the buried past of the earth,
Built Nineveh with our sighing,
    And Babel itself in our mirth;
And o'erthrew them with prophesying
    To the old of the new world's worth;
For each age is a dream that is dying,
    Or one that is coming to birth.

A breath of our inspiration
Is the life of each generation;
    A wondrous thing of our dreaming
    Unearthly, impossible seeming —
The soldier, the king, and the peasant
    Are working together in one,
Till our dream shall become their present,
    And their work in the world be done.

They had no vision amazing
Of the goodly house they are raising;
    They had no divine foreshowing
    Of the land to which they are going:
But on one man's soul it hath broken,
    A light that doth not depart;
And his look, or a word he hath spoken,
    Wrought flame in another man's heart.

And therefore to-day is thrilling
With a past day's late fulfilling;
    And the multitudes are enlisted
    In the faith that their fathers resisted,
And, scorning the dream of to-morrow,
    Are bringing to pass, as they may,
In the world, for its joy or its sorrow,
    The dream that was scorned yesterday.

But we, with our dreaming and singing,
    Ceaseless and sorrowless we!
The glory about us clinging
    Of the glorious futures we see,
Our souls with high music ringing:
    O men! it must ever be
That we dwell, in our dreaming and singing,
    A little apart from ye.

For we are afar with the dawning
    And the suns that are not yet high,
And out of the infinite morning
    Intrepid you hear us cry —
How, spite of your human scorning,
    Once more God's future draws nigh,
And already goes forth the warning
    That ye of the past must die.

Great hail! we cry to the comers
    From the dazzling unknown shore;
Bring us hither your sun and your summers;
    And renew our world as of yore;
You shall teach us your song's new numbers,
    And things that we dreamed not before:
Yea, in spite of a dreamer who slumbers,
    And a singer who sings no more."
1538,Sea-Fever,John Masefield,"I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by; And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking, And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.   I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying, And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.   I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life, To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife; And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover, And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over."
1539,Sonnet 1 ﻿,Sir Philip Sidney,"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,—
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others’ leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Invention’s stay:
Invention, Nature’s child, fled step-dame Study’s blows,
And others’ feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:
“Fool,” said my Muse to me, “look in thy heart and write.”
﻿"
1540,The Sorrow of True Love ﻿,Edward Thomas,"The sorrow of true love is a great sorrow
And true love parting blackens a bright morrow:
Yet almost they equal joys, since their despair
Is but hope blinded by its tears, and clear
Above the storm the heavens wait to be seen.
But greater sorrow from less love has been
That can mistake lack of despair for hope
And knows not tempest and the perfect scope
Of summer, but a frozen drizzle perpetual
Of drops that from remorse and pity fall
And cannot ever shine in the sun or thaw,
Removed eternally from the sun’s law.
 ﻿"
1541,The Watchers,William Stanley Braithwaite,"Two women on the lone wet strand
   (The wind's out with a will to roam)
The waves wage war on rocks and sand, 
   (And a ship is long due home.)

The sea sprays in the women's eyes—
   (Hearts can writhe like the sea's wild foam)
Lower descend the tempestuous skies,
   (For the wind's out with a will to roam.)

""O daughter, thine eyes be better than mine,""
   (The waves ascend high as yonder dome)
""North or south is there never a sign?""
   (And a ship is long due home.)

They watched there all the long night through—
   (The wind's out with a will to roam)
Wind and rain and sorrow for two—
   (And heaven on the long reach home.)"
1542,Girls’ Middle School Orchestra,Michael Ryan,"They’re all dressed up in carmine
floor-length velvet gowns, their upswirled hair
festooned with matching ribbons:
their fresh hopes and our fond hopes for them
infuse this sort-of-music as if happiness could actually be
each-plays-her-part-and-all-will-take-care-of-itself.
Their hearts unscarred under quartz lights
beam through the darkness in which we sit
to show us why we endured at home
the squeaking and squawking and botched notes
that now in concert are almost beautiful,
almost rendering this heartrending music
composed for an archduke who loved it so much
he spent his fortune for the musicians
who could bring it brilliantly to life."
1543,Falling Water,John Koethe,"I drove to Oak Park, took two tours,
And looked at some of the houses.
I took the long way back along the lake.
The place that I came home to—a cavernous
Apartment on the East Side of Milwaukee—
Seems basically a part of that tradition,
With the same admixture of expansion and restraint:
The space takes off, yet leaves behind a nagging
Feeling of confinement, with the disconcerting sense
That while the superficial conflicts got resolved,
The underlying tensions brought to equilibrium,
It isn’t yet a place in which I feel that I can live.
Imagine someone reading. Contemplate a man
Oblivious to his settings, and then a distant person
Standing in an ordinary room, hemmed in by limitations,
Yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life
That blooms within its own mysterious enclosure,
In a solitary space in which the soul can breathe
And where the heart can stay—not by discovering it,
But by creating it, by giving it a self-sustaining
Atmosphere of depth, both in the architecture,
And in the unconstructed life that it contains.
In a late and very brief remark, Freud speculates
That space is the projection of a “psychic apparatus”
Which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself;
And Wright extols “that primitive sense of shelter”
Which can turn a house into a refuge from despair.
I wish that time could bring the future back again
And let me see things as they used to seem to me
Before I found myself alone, in an emancipated state—
Alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow.
There used to be a logic in the way time passed
That made it flow directly towards an underlying space
Where all the minor, individual lives converged.
The moments borrowed their perceptions from the past
And bathed the future in a soft, familiar light
I remembered from home, and which has faded.
And the voices get supplanted by the rain,
The nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind
That used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky
Turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air,
While in its place a kind of monument appears,
Magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity
And standing in a small and singular expanse—
As though the years had been a pretext for reflection,
And my life had been a phase of disenchantment—
As the faces that I cherished gradually withdraw,
The reassuring settings slowly melt away,
And what remains is just a sense of getting older.
In a variation of the parable, the pure of heart
Descend into a kingdom that they never wanted
And refused to see. The homely notions of the good,
The quaint ideas of perfection swept away like
Adolescent fictions as the real forms of life
Deteriorate with manically increasing speed,
The kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter,
And the serenity it brings—not in reflection,
But in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken,
Of losing everything, of acquiescing in the
Obvious approach (the house shaped like a box;
The life that can’t accommodate another’s)—
As the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things.
 
Why can’t the more expansive ecstasies come true?
I met you more than thirty years ago, in 1958,
In Mrs. Wolford’s eighth grade history class.
All moments weigh the same, and matter equally;
Yet those that time brings back create the fables
Of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes
Passing on the way to either peace or disappointment—
Like a paper calendar on which  it’s always autumn
And we’re back in school again; or a hazy afternoon
Near the beginning of October, with the World Series
Playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open,
And the California sunlight filling up the room.
When I survey the mural stretched across the years
—Across my heart—I notice mostly small, neglected
Parts of no importance to the whole design, but which,
In their obscurity, seem more permanent and real.
I see the desks and auditorium, suffused with
Yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that
Still remains there, in a space pervaded by a
Soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate—
As though the future weren’t real, and the present
Were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to,
And the past were there forever. And the art
That time inflicts upon its subjects can’t
Eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood,
Which harden into shapes as it recedes.
I wish I knew a way of looking at the world
That didn’t find it wanting, or of looking at my
Life that didn’t always see a half-completed
Structure made of years and filled with images
And gestures emblematic of the past, like Gatsby’s
Light, or Proust’s imbalance on the stones.
I wish there were a place where I could stay
And leave the world alone—an enormous stadium
Where I could wander back and forth across a field
Replete with all the incidents and small details
That gave the days their textures, that bound the
Minutes into something solid, and that linked them
All together in a way that used to seem eternal.
We used to go to dances in my family’s ancient
Cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening
Climbing up the hill outside Del Mar. And later
I can see us steaming off the cover of the Beatles’
Baby-butcher album at your house in Mission Bay;
And three years later listening to the Velvet
Underground performing in a roller skating rink.
Years aren’t texts, or anything like texts;
And yet I often think of 1968 that way, as though
That single year contained the rhythms of the rest,
As what began in hope and eagerness concluded in
Intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a
Puzzling fiasco over poor John Godfrey’s hair.
The parts were real, and yet the dense and living
Whole they once composed seems broken now, its
Voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me
More distantly each day, until the tangled years
Are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a
Sequence of the places where we lived: your parents’
House in Kensington, and mine above the canyon:
Then the flat by Sears in Cambridge, where we
Moved when we got married, and the third floor
Of the house on Francis Avenue, near Harvard Square;
The big apartment in Milwaukee where we lived the
Year that John was born, and last of all the
House in Whitefish Bay, where you live now
And all those years came inexplicably undone
In mid-July. The sequence ended late last year.
Suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world
As it exists for one. Then half of mine has ended,
While the fragment which has recently come to be
Contains no vantage point from which to see it whole.
I think that people are the sum of their illusions,
That the cares that make them difficult to see
Are eased by distance, with their errors blending
In an intricate harmony, their truths abiding
In a subtle “spark” or psyche (each incomparable,
Yet each the same as all the others) and their
Disparate careers all joined together in a tangled
Moral vision whose intense, meandering design
Seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling,
As in grief, or in the pathos of a life
Cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate,
Because the most important thing is human happiness—
Not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of
Lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms
And with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real.
The whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate
Reflections on the day that came at evening, whose
Significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood,
Because the facts were almost always unexceptional.
Two years ago we took our son to Paris. Last night
I picked him up and took him to a Lou Reed show,
And then took him home. I look at all the houses as I
Walk down Hackett Avenue to work. I teach my classes,
Visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself,
Yet in the end the minutes don’t add up. What’s lost
Is the perception of the world as something good
And held in common; as a place to be perfected
In the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters
That endowed it with integrity and structure,
And that merged its private moments with the past.
What broke it into pieces? What transformed the
Flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and
Smoldering resentment—like coming home too early,
Or walking too far ahead of you on the rue Jacob?
I wish that life could be a window on the sun,
Instead of just this porch where I can stand and
Contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot
And feel it moving towards some unknown resolution.
The Guggenheim Museum just reopened. Tonight I
Watched a segment of the news on PBS—narrated by a
Woman we met years ago at Bob’s—that showed how
Most of Wright’s interior had been restored,
And how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky.
I like the houses better—they flow in all directions,
Merging with the scenery and embodying a milder,
More domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale
That doesn’t overwhelm the life that it encloses.
Isn’t there a way to feel at home within the
Confines of this bland, accommodating structure
Made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock
Hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished
Prairie School house in Whitefish Bay—the lineal,
Reduced descendant of the “Flameproof” Wright house
Just a block or two away from where I live now?
I usually walk along the street on Sunday,
Musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it
Recapitulate the Oak Park house and studio, with
Open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior,
And with the entrance half-concealed on the side—
A characteristic feature of his plans that made it
Difficult to find, although the hope was that in
Trying to get inside, the visitor’s eye would come to
Linger over subtleties he might have failed to see—
In much the way that in the course of getting older,
And trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here,
I found myself pulled backwards through these old,
Uncertain passages, distracted by the details,
And meeting only barriers to understanding why the
Years unfolded as they did, and why my life
Turned out the way it has—like his signature
“Pathway of Discovery,” with each diversion
Adding to the integrity of the whole.
 
There is this sweep life has that makes the
Accidents of time and place seem small.
Everything alters, and the personal concerns
That love could hold together for a little while
Decay, and then the world seems strange again,
And meaningless and free. I miss the primitive
Confusions, and the secret way things came to me
Each evening, and the pain. I still wonder
Where the tears went, standing in my room each day
And quietly inhabiting a calm, suspended state
Enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me,
With the background noise cascading out of nothing
Like a song that makes the days go by, a song
Incorporating everything—not into what it says,
But simply in the way it touches me, a single
Image of dispersal, the inexhaustible perception
Of contingency and transience and isolation.
It brings them back to me. I have the inwardness
I think I must have wanted, and the quietude,
The solitary temper, and this space where I can
Linger with the silence curling all around me
Like the sound of pure passage, waiting here
Surrounded by the furniture, the books and lists
And all these other emblems of the floating world,
The prints of raindrops that begin as mist, that fall
Discreetly through the atmosphere, and disappear.
And then I feel them in the air, in a reserved,
More earthly music filled with voices reassembling
In a wellspring of remembrance, talking to me again,
And finding shelter in the same evasive movements
I can feel in my own life, cloaked in a quiet
Dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old,
And fading out of other people’s consciousness,
And dying –with its deepest insecurities and fears
Concealed by their own protective colorations,
As the mind secretes its shell and calls it home.
It has the texture of an uncreated substance,
Hovering between the settings it had come to love
And some unformulated state I can’t imagine—
Waiting for the telephone to ring, obsessed with
Ways to occupy these wide, unstructured hours,
And playing records by myself, and waking up alone.
All things are disparate, yet subject to the same
Intense, eradicating wills of time and personality,
Like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build
Between our lives and emptiness, the certainty they
Seemed to have just two or three short years ago,
Before the anger spread its poison over everything.
I think about the way our visions locked together
In a nightmare play of nervousness and language,
Living day to day inside the concentrated
Force of that relentless argument, whose words
Swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety, two
People clinging to their versions of their lives
Almost like children—living out each other’s
Intermittent fantasies, that fed upon themselves
As though infected by some vile, concentrated hatred;
Who then woke up and planned that evening’s dinner.
It’s all memories now, and distance. Miles away
The cat is sleeping on the driveway, John’s in school,
And sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen.
Nothing really changes—the external world intrudes
And then withdraws, and then becomes continuous again.
I went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant
Lanterns made of opalescent art glass—part, I guess,
Of what this morning’s paper called the “Wright craze.”
I like the easy way the days go by, the parts of aging
That have come to seem familiar, and the uneventful
Calm that seems to settle on the house at night.
Each morning brings the mirror’s reassuring face,
As though the years had left the same enduring person
Simplified and changed—no longer vaguely desperate,
No longer torn, yet still impatient with himself
And still restless; but drained of intricacy and rage,
Like a mild paradox—uninteresting in its own right,
Yet existing for the sake of something stranger.
Now and then our life comes over me, in brief,
Involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom
Unexpectedly, in fleeting moments of regret
That come before the ache, the pang that gathers
Sharply, like an indrawn breath—a strange and
Thoughtful kind of pain, as though a steel
Band had somehow snapped inside my heart.
I don’t know. But what I do know is that
None of it is ever going to come to me again.
Why did I think a person only distantly like me
Might finally represent my life? What aspects
Of my attitudes, my cast of mind, my inconclusive
Way of tossing questions at the world had I
Supposed might realize another person’s fantasies
And turn her into someone else—who gradually became
A separate part of me, and argued with the very
Words I would have used, and looked at me through
Eyes I’d looked at as though gazing at myself?
I guess we only realize ourselves in dreams,
Or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining
All the charms that contemplation holds—until the
Long enchantment of the soul with what it sees
Is lifted, and it startles at a space alight with
Objects of its infantile gaze, like people in a mall.
I saw her just the other day. I felt a kind of
Comfort at her face, one tinctured with bemusement
At the strange and guarded person she’d become—
Attractive, vaguely friendly, brisk (too brisk),
But no one I could think might represent my life.
Why did I even try to see myself in what’s outside?
The strangeness pushes it away, propels the vision
Back upon itself, into these regions filled with
Shapes that I can wander through and never see,
As though their image were inherently unreal.
The houses on a street, the quiet backyard shade,
The room restored to life with bric-a-brac—
I started by revisiting these things, then slowly
Reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible
That balanced sympathy and space inside an
Abstract edifice combining reaches of the past
With all these speculations, all this artful
Preening of the heart. I sit here at my desk,
Perplexed and puzzled, teasing out a tangled
Skein of years we wove together, and trying to
Combine the fragments of those years into a poem.
Who cares if life—if someone’s actual life—is
Finally insignificant and small? There’s still a
Splendor in the way it flowers once and fades
And leaves a carapace behind. There isn’t time to
Linger over why it happened, or attempt to make its
Mystery come to life again and last, like someone
Still embracing the confused perceptions of himself
Embedded in the past, as though eternity lay there—
For heaven’s a delusion, and eternity is in the details,
And this tiny, insubstantial life is all there is.
—And that would be enough, but for the reoccurring
Dreams I often have of you. Sometimes at night
The banished unrealities return, as though a room
Suffused with light and poetry took shape around me.
Pictures line the walls. It’s early summer.
Somewhere in Remembrance of Things Past, Marcel,
Reflecting on his years with “Albertine”—with X—
Suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance,
Of the separation of two lives in time and space.
I think the same estrangement’s mirrored in each life,
In how it seems both adequate and incomplete—part
Day-to-day existence, part imaginary construct
Beckoning at night, and sighing through my dreams
Like some disconsolate chimera, or the subject
Of a lonely, terrifying sadness; or the isolation
Of a quiet winter evening, when the house feels empty,
And silence intervenes. But in the wonderful
Enclosure opening in my heart, I seem to recognize
Our voices lilting in the yard, inflected by the
Rhythms of a song whose words are seamless
And whose lines are never-ending. I can almost
See the contours of your face, and sense the
Presence of the trees, and reimagine all of us
Together in a deep, abiding happiness, as if the
Three of us inhabited a fragile, made-up world
That seemed to be so permanent, so real.
I have this fantasy: It’s early in the evening.
You and I are sitting in the backyard, talking.
Friends arrive, then drinks and dinner, conversation…
 
The lovely summer twilight lasts forever…
 
                                       What’s the use?
What purpose do these speculations serve? What
Mild enchantments do these meditations leave?
They’re just the murmurs of an age, of middle age,
That help to pass the time that they retrieve
Before subsiding, leaving everything unchanged.
Each of us at times has felt the future fade,
Or seen the compass of his life diminished,
Or realized some tangible illusion was unreal.
Driving down to Evanston last week, I suddenly
Remembered driving down that road eight years ago,
So caught up in some story I’d just finished
That I’d missed the way the countryside was changing—
How in place of trees there now were office towers
And theme parks, parts of a confusingly panoply of
Barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape
Filled with high, receding clouds and rows of flimsy
Houses in what used to be a field. I thought of
Other people’s lives, and how impossible it seemed
To grasp them on the model of my own—as little
Mirrors of infinity—or sense their forms of
Happiness, or in their minor personal upheavals
Feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale
And see its abstract argument made visible.
I thought of overarching dreams of plenitude—
How life lacks shape until it’s given one by love,
And how each soul is both a kingdom in itself
And part of some incorporating whole that
Feels and has a face and lets it live forever.
All of these seemed true, and cancelled one another,
Leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence
Tracing out the contours of a world erased,
Like music tracing out the contours of the mind—﻿
For life has the form of a winding curve in space
And in its wake the human figure disappears.
Look at our surroundings—where a previous age
Could visualize a landscape we see borders,
Yet I think the underlying vision is the same:
A person positing a world that he can see
And can’t contain, and vexed by other people.
Everything is possible; some of it seemed real
Or nearly real, yet in the end it spoke to me alone,
In phrases echoing the isolation of a meager
Ledge above a waterfall, or rolling across a vast,
Expanding plain on which there’s always room,
But only room for one. It starts and ends
Inside an ordinary room, while in the interim
Brimming with illusions, filled with commonplace
Delights that make the days go by, with simple
Arguments and fears, and with the nervous
Inkling of some vague, utopian conceit
Transforming both the landscape and our lives,
Until we look around and find ourselves at home,
But in a wholly different world. And even those
Catastrophes that seemed to alter everything
Seem fleeting, grounded in a natural order
All of us are subject to, and ought to celebrate.
—Yet why? That things are temporary doesn’t
Render them unreal, unworthy of regretting.
It’s not as though the past had never happened:
All those years were real, and their loss was real,
And it is sad—I don’t know what else to call it.
I’m glad that both of us seem happy. Yet what
Troubles me is just the way what used to be a world
Turned out, in retrospect, to be a state of mind,
And no more tangible than that. And now it’s gone,
And in its place I find the image of a process
Of inexorable decay, or of some great unraveling
That drags the houses forward into emptiness
And backwards into pictures of the intervening days
Love pieced together out of nothing. And I’m
Certain that this austere vision finally is true,
And yet it strikes me as too meager to believe.
It comes from much too high above the world
And seems to me too hopeless, too extreme—
But then I found myself one winter afternoon
Remembering a quiet morning in a classroom
And inventing everything again, in ordinary
Terms that seemed to comprehend a childish
Dream of love, and then the loss of love,
And all the intricate years between."
1544,Double Dutch,Gregory Pardlo,"The girls turning double-dutch
bob & weave like boxers pulling
punches, shadowing each other,
sparring across the slack cord
casting parabolas in the air. They
whip quick as an infant’s pulse
and the jumper, before she
enters the winking, nods in time
as if she has a notion to share,
waiting her chance to speak. But she’s
anticipating the upbeat
like a bandleader counting off
the tune they are about to swing into.
The jumper stair-steps into mid-air
as if she’s jumping rope in low-gravity,
training for a lunar mission. Airborne a moment
long enough to fit a second thought in,
she looks caught in the mouth bones of a fish
as she flutter-floats into motion
like a figure in a stack of time-lapse photos
thumbed alive. Once inside,
the bells tied to her shoestrings rouse the gods
who’ve lain in the dust since the Dutch
acquired Manhattan. How she dances
patterns like a dust-heavy bee retracing
its travels in scale before the hive. How
the whole stunning contraption of girl and rope
slaps and scoops like a paddle boat.
Her misted skin arranges the light
with each adjustment and flex. Now heather-
hued, now sheen, light listing on the fulcrum
of a wrist and the bare jutted joints of elbow
and knee, and the faceted surfaces of muscle,
surfaces fracturing and reforming
like a sun-tickled sleeve of running water.
She makes jewelry of herself and garlands
the ground with shadows.

1546,End of Summer,Stanley Kunitz,"An agitation of the air,
A perturbation of the light
Admonished me the unloved year
Would turn on its hinge that night.
 
I stood in the disenchanted field
Amid the stubble and the stones,
Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me
The song of my marrow-bones.
 
Blue poured into summer blue,
A hawk broke from his cloudless tower,
The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew
That part of my life was over.
 
Already the iron door of the north
Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows
Order their populations forth,
And a cruel wind blows."
1547,Four Glimpses of Night,Frank Marshall Davis,"I
 
Eagerly
Like a woman hurrying to her lover
Night comes to the room of the world
And lies, yielding and content
Against the cool round face
Of the moon.
 
II
 
Night is a curious child, wandering
Between earth and sky, creeping
In windows and doors, daubing
The entire neighborhood
With purple paint.
Day
Is an apologetic mother
Cloth in hand
Following after.

Peddling
From door to door
Night sells
Black bags of peppermint stars
Heaping cones of vanilla moon
Until
His wares are gone
Then shuffles homeward
Jingling the gray coins
Of daybreak.

Night’s brittle song, sliver-thin
Shatters into a billion fragments
Of quiet shadows
At the blaring jazz
Of a morning sun.

1548,Hunger Moon,Jane Cooper,"The last full moon of February
stalks the fields; barbed wire casts a shadow.
Rising slowly, a beam moved toward the west
stealthily changing position
 
until now, in the small hours, across the snow
it advances on my pillow
to wake me, not rudely like the sun
but with the cocked gun of silence.
 
I am alone in a vast room
where a vain woman once slept.
The moon, in pale buckskins, crouches
on guard beside her bed.
 
Slowly the light wanes, the snow will melt
and all the fences thrum in the spring breeze
but not until that sleeper, trapped
in my body, turns and turns."
1549,Inventing a Horse,Meghan O'Rourke,"Inventing a horse is not easy.
One must not only think of the horse.
One must dig fence posts around him.
One must include a place where horses like to live;
 
or do when they live with humans like you.
Slowly, you must walk him in the cold;
feed him bran mash, apples;
accustom him to the harness;
 
holding in mind even when you are tired
harnesses and tack cloths and saddle oil
to keep the saddle clean as a face in the sun;
one must imagine teaching him to run
 
among the knuckles of tree roots,
not to be skittish at first sight of timber wolves,
and not to grow thin in the city,
where at some point you will have to live;
 
and one must imagine the absence of money.
Most of all, though: the living weight,
the sound of his feet on the needles,
and, since he is heavy, and real,
 
and sometimes tired after a run
down the river with a light whip at his side,
one must imagine love
in the mind that does not know love,
 
an animal mind, a love that does not depend
on your image of it,
your understanding of it;
indifferent to all that it lacks:
 
a muzzle and two black eyes
looking the day away, a field empty
of everything but witchgrass, fluent trees,
and some piles of hay."
1550,The Layers,Stanley Kunitz,"I have walked through many lives,
some of them my own,
and I am not who I was,
though some principle of being
abides, from which I struggle
not to stray.
When I look behind,
as I am compelled to look
before I can gather strength
to proceed on my journey,
I see the milestones dwindling
toward the horizon
and the slow fires trailing
from the abandoned camp-sites,
over which scavenger angels
wheel on heavy wings.
Oh, I have made myself a tribe
out of my true affections,
and my tribe is scattered!
How shall the heart be reconciled
to its feast of losses?
In a rising wind
the manic dust of my friends,
those who fell along the way,
bitterly stings my face.
Yet I turn, I turn,
exulting somewhat,
with my will intact to go
wherever I need to go,
and every stone on the road
precious to me.
In my darkest night,
when the moon was covered
and I roamed through wreckage,
a nimbus-clouded voice
directed me:
“Live in the layers,
not on the litter.”
Though I lack the art
to decipher it,
no doubt the next chapter
in my book of transformations
is already written.
I am not done with my changes."
1551,Marcus Aurelius Rose,Lisa Jarnot,"for Thomas

From the five good emperors
I have learned that there were five good emperors,
 
From the lemon tree I’ve planted
now I know that leaves unpummeled yet will drop,
 
From the clock, the time, it’s five p.m.,
from the sun the length of day,
 
From Quercus borealis, the queer names of the leaves
of all the trees,
 
From burning I’ve learned burning,
from the aster family chickory abounds,
 
From hawkweed of the colors bright,
from sleeping, of my dreams,
 
From mosquitoes, scratching, from fishes, fishing,
from turkeys how to run and how to hop,
 
From erect perennials I’ve learned to reach the shelf,
from my cats to lick the dark part of the tin,
 
From the sparrows I’ve learned this and that,
from Germanic tribes, to gather thoughts in herds,
 
From the window blinds, from the sun decayed,
from the heart, a brimming record braised and turned."
1552,This Most Perfect Hill,Lisa Jarnot,"On this most perfect hill
with these most perfect dogs
are these most perfect people
and this most perfect fog
 
In this most perfect fog
that is the middle of the sea
inside the perfect middle of
the things inside that swing
 
In this most perfect rhyme
that takes up what it sees,
with perfect shelter from the
rain as perfect as can be,
 
In this most perfect day
at the apex of the sun
runs this most perfect
frog song that is roiling
from the mud
 
In these most perfect habits
of the waving of the trees,
through this imperfect language
rides a perfect brilliancy."
1553,ABBA,Dennis Cooper,"for Brad Gooch

We snort all our coke
on the way to the party.
We bring the new album.
We dance while we listen.
 
The band is two women
whose husbands control them.
They do not speak our language.
Each syllable’s an obstacle.
 
They are in love with a man.
He is in love with another.
But they’re in no hurry.
They could wait forever.
 
And when they are out
on the make for a lover,
they’ll always find him.
They are the tigers.
 
We are stoned too stoned to.
We dance till we’re tired
and listen to lyrics
we mouth like a language.
 
What we feel, when we
hear them, is inexpressible.
We can’t put into words.
Maybe our dances show it.
 
ABBA lives for their music.
We long for each other.
They see what we’re doing.
They put it on record.
 
They play it, we listen.
We are absolutely stunned.
We feel, and they know
more than anyone can say."
1554,"After School, Street Football, Eighth Grade",Dennis Cooper,"Their jeans sparkled, cut off
way above the knee, and my
friends and I would watch them
from my porch, books of poems
lost in our laps, eyes wide as
tropical fish behind our glasses.

Their football flashed from hand
to hand, tennis shoes gripped
the asphalt, sweat's spotlight on
their strong backs. We would
dream of hugging them, and crouch
later in weird rooms, and come.

Once their ball fell our way
so two of them came over, hands
on their hips, asking us to
throw it to them, which Arthur did,
badly, and they chased it back.
One turned to yell, “Thanks”

and we dreamed of his long
teeth in our necks. We
wanted them to wander over,
place deep wet underarms to
our lips, and then their white
asses, then those loud mouths.

One day one guy was very tired,
didn't move fast enough,
so a car hit him and he sprawled
fifty feet away, sexy, but he was
dead, blood like lipstick, then
those great boys stood together

on the sidewalk and we joined them,
mixing in like one big friendship
to the cops, who asked if we were,
and those boys were too sad to counter.
We'd known his name, Tim, and how
he'd turned to thank us nicely

but now he was under a sheet
anonymous as God, the big boys crying,
spitting words, and we stunned
like intellectuals get, our high
voices soft as the tinkling of a
chandelier on a ceiling too high to see."

gaunt, ugly deformed
 
broken from the womb, and horribly shriven
at the labor of their forefathers, if you check back
 
scout around grey before actual time
their sordid brains don’t work right,
pinched men emaciated, piling up railroad ties and highway
ditches
blanched women, swollen and crudely numb
ered before the dark of dawn
 
scuttling by candlelight, one not to touch, that is, a signal panic
thick peasants after the attitude
 
at that time of their century, bleak and centrifugal
they carry about them, tough disciplines of copper Indianheads.
 
there are worse, whom you may never see, non-crucial around the
spoke, these you do, seldom
locked in Taunton State Hospital and other peon work farms
drudge from morning until night, abandoned within destitute
crevices odd clothes
intent on performing some particular task long has been far
removed
there is no hope, they locked-in key’s; housed of course
 
and there fed, poorly
off sooted, plastic dishes, soiled grimy silver knives and forks,
stamped Department of Mental Health spoons
but the unshrinkable duties of any society
produces its ill-kempt, ignorant and sore idiosyncrasies.
 
There has never been a man yet, whom no matter how wise
can explain how a god, so beautiful he can create
the graces of formal gardens, the exquisite twilight sunsets
in splendor of elegant toolsmiths, still can yield the horror of
 
dwarfs, who cannot stand up straight with crushed skulls,
diseases on their legs and feet unshaven faces of men and women,
worn humped backs, deformed necks, hare lips, obese arms
distended rumps, there is not a flame shoots out could ex-
tinguish the torch of any liberty’s state infection.

persons who felt they were never given a chance, had n-
o luck and were flayed at suffering.
 
They produced children with phobias, manias and depression,
they cared little for their own metier, and kept watch upon
others, some chance to get ahead
 
Yes life was hard for them, much more hard than for any blo
ated millionaire, who still lives on
their hard-earned monies. I feel I shall
have to be punished for writing this,
that the omniscient god is the rich one,
cared little for looks, less for Art,
still kept weekly films close for the
free dishes and scandal hot. Some how
though got cheated in health and upon
hearth. I am one of them. I am witness
not to Whitman’s vision, but instead the
poorhouses, the mad city asylums and re-
life worklines. Yes, I am witness not to
God’s goodness, but his better or less scorn.

1972"
1556,Cocaine,John Wieners,"For I have seen love
and his face is choice Heart of Hearts,
a flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center
where all Motion is one.
 
And I have known
despair that the Face has ceased to stare
at me with the Rose of the world
but lies furled
 
in an artificial paradise it is Hell to get into.
If I knew you were there
I would fall upon my knees and plead to God
to deliver you in my arms once again.
 
But it is senseless to try.
One can only take means to reduce misery,
confuse the sensations so that this Face,
what aches in the heart and makes each new
 
start less close to the source of desire,
fade from the flesh that fires the night,
with dreams and infinite longing."
1557,Lastness,Galway Kinnell,"A black bear sits alone
in the twilight, nodding from side
to side, turning slowly around and around
on himself, scuffing the four-footed
circle into the earth. He sniffs the sweat
in the breeze, he understands
a creature, a death-creature,
watches from the fringe of the trees,
finally he understands
I am no longer here, he himself
from the fringe of the trees watches
a black bear
get up, eat a few flowers, trudge away,
all his fur glistening
in the rain.
 
And what glistening! Sancho Fergus,
my boychild, had such great shoulders,
when he was born his head
came out, the rest of him stuck. And he opened
his eyes: his head out there all alone
in the room, he squinted with pained,
barely unglued eyes at the ninth-month’s
blood splashing beneath him
on the floor. And almost
smiled, I thought, almost forgave it all in advance.
 
When he came wholly forth
I took him up in my hands and bent
over and smelled
the black, glistening fur
of his head, as empty space
must have bent
over the newborn planet
and smelled the grasslands and the ferns.

1558,Our Nature,Rae Armantrout,"The very flatness
of portraits
makes for nostalgia
in the connoisseur.
 
Here’s the latest
little lip of wave
to flatten
and spread thin.
 
Let’s say
it shows our recklessness,
 
our fast gun,
 
our self-consciousness
which was really
 
our infatuation
with our own fame,
 
our escapes,
 
the easy way
we’d blend in
 
with the peasantry,
 
our loyalty
to our old gang
 
from among whom
it was our nature
 
to be singled out"
1559,A Poem for Painters,John Wieners,"Our age bereft of nobility
        How can our faces show it?
I look for love.
        My lips stand out
dry and cracked with want
                                     of it.
                                    Oh it is well.
My poem shall show the need for it.
 
                        Again we go driven by forces
       we have no control over. Only
                                                    in the poem
      comes an image that we rule
                      the line by the pen
in the painter’s hand one foot
                              away from me.
 
                              Drawing the face
                              and its torture.
That is why no one dares tackle it.
                    Held as they are in the hands
                                of forces they
                    cannot understand.
                                                       That despair
        is on my face and shall show
        in the fine lines of any man.
 
I had love once in the palm of my hand.
See the lines there.
                                      How we played
its game, are playing now
in the bounds of white and heartless fields.
 
Fall down on my head, love,
drench my flesh in the streams
                                of fine sprays. Like
                                       French perfume
so that I light up as
                                     mountain glorys
and I am showered by the scent
                          of the finished line.
 
                                             No circles
                       but that two parallels do cross
And carry our souls and bodies
       together as the planets,
                     Showing light on the surface
                            of our skin, knowing
                     that so much of it flows through
                           the veins underneath.
                     Our cheeks puffed with it.

                                    6.
 
   At last the game is over
                                             and the line lengthens.
   Let us stay with what we know.
 
That love is my strength, that
I am overpowered by it:
                                        desire
                                                  that too
is on the face: gone stale.
When green was the bed my love
and I laid down upon.
Such it is, heart’s complaint,
You hear upon a day in June.
And I see no end in view
when summer goes, as it will,
upon the roads, like singing
companions across the land.
 
Go with it man, if you must,
but leave us markers on your way.
 
South of Mission, Seattle,
over the Sierra Mountains,
the Middle West and Michigan,
moving east again, easy
coming into Chicago and
the cattle country, calling
to each other over canyons,
careful not to be caught
at night, they are still out,
the destroyers, and down
into the South, familiar land,
lush places, blue mountains
of Carolina, into Black Mountain
and you can sleep out, or
straight across into States
 
I cannot think of their names.
 
This nation is so large, like
our hands, our love it lives
with no lover, looking only
for the beloved, back home
into the heart, New York,
New England, Vermont green
mountains, and Massachusetts
my city, Boston and the sea.
Again to smell what this calm
ocean cannot tell us. The seasons.
Only the heart remembers
and records in words
of works
we lay down for those men
who can come to them.
 
 
                                     7.
 
At last. I come to the last defense.
 
My poems contain no
                      wilde beestes, no
lady of the lake music
of the spheres, or organ chants,
 
yet by these lines
I betray what little given me.
 
One needs no defense.
 
             Only the score of a man’s
             struggle to stay  with
             what is his own, what
             lies within him to do.
 
             Without which is nothing,
             for him or those who hear him
             And I come to this,
             knowing the waste, leaving
 
             the rest up to love
             and its twisted faces
             my hands claw out at
             only to draw back from the
             blood already running there.
 
             Oh come back, whatever heart
             you have left. It is my life
             you save. The poem is done.

1560,A Poem for Record Players,John Wieners,"The scene changes
 
Five hours later and
I come into a room
where a clock ticks.
I find a pillow to
muffle the sounds I make.
I am engaged in taking away
from God his sound.
The pigeons somewhere
above me, the cough
a man makes down the hall,
the flap of wings
below me, the squeak
of sparrows in the alley.
The scratches I itch
on my scalp, the landing
of birds under the bay
window out my window.
All dull details
I can only describe to you,
but which are here and
I hear and shall never
give up again, shall carry
with me over the streets
of this seacoast city,
forever; oh clack your
metal wings, god, you are
mine now in the morning.
I have you by the ears
in the exhaust pipes of
a thousand cars gunning
their motors turning over
all over town.

1561,A Poem for the Old Man,John Wieners,"God love you
   Dana my lover
lost in the horde
on this Friday night,
500 men are moving up
& down from the bath
room to the bar.
Remove this desire
from the man I love.
Who has opened
   the savagery
of the sea to me.
 
See to it that
his wants are filled
on California street
Bestow on him lar-
gesse that allows him
peace in his loins.
 
Leave him not
to the moths.
Make him out a lion
so that all who see him
hero worship his
thick chest as I did
moving my mouth
over his back bringing
our hearts to heights
I never hike over
   anymore.
Let blond hair burn
on the back of his
neck, let no ache
screw his face
up in pain, his soul
   is so hooked.
Not heroin.
Rather fix these
hundred men as his
lovers & lift him
with the enormous bale
of their desire.

1562,A poem for vipers,John Wieners,"I sit in Lees. At 11:40 PM with
Jimmy the pusher. He teaches me
Ju Ju. Hot on the table before us
shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
chow yuke. Up the street under the wheels
of a strange car is his stash—The ritual.
We make it. And have made it.
For months now together after midnight.
Soon I know the fuzz will
interrupt, will arrest Jimmy and
I shall be placed on probation. The poem
does not lie to us. We lie under
its law, alive in the glamour of this hour
able to enter into the sacred places
of his dark people, who carry secrets
glassed in their eyes and hide words
under the coats of their tongue.

1563,Sleeping with the Dictionary,Harryette Mullen,"I beg to dicker with my silver-tongued companion, whose lips are ready to read my shining gloss. A versatile partner, conversant and well-versed in the verbal art, the dictionary is not averse to the solitary habits of the curiously wide-awake reader. In the dark night’s insomnia, the book is a stimulating sedative, awakening my tired imagination to the hypnagogic trance of language. Retiring to the canopy of the bedroom, turning on the bedside light, taking the big dictionary to bed, clutching the unabridged bulk, heavy with the weight of all the meanings between these covers, smoothing the thin sheets, thick with accented syllables—all are exercises in the conscious regimen of dreamers, who toss words on their tongues while turning illuminated pages. To go through all these motions and procedures, groping in the dark for an alluring word, is the poet’s nocturnal mission. Aroused by myriad possibilities, we try out the most perverse positions in the practice of our nightly act, the penetration of the denotative body of the work. Any exit from the logic of language might be an entry in a symptomatic dictionary. The alphabetical order of this ample block of knowledge might render a dense lexicon of lucid hallucinations. Beside the bed, a pad lies open to record the meandering of migratory words. In the rapid eye movement of the poet’s night vision, this dictum can be decoded, like the secret acrostic of a lover’s name."
1564,The Suicide,John Wieners,"Yes I put her away.
      But now life flares up
   As safe as China in a cup
   You hear the droppings
             of her heart.
 
   Leaves rustle on the windowpane.
Three o’clock turns round again.
The man in the moon grows full
Of her death while earth awaits
   beneath
To receive her ashes on the wind.
 
       Yes, earth owns the wind
       As I her life
       Whom I have never seen
       Nor been with
Still within our hearts there lies
          this communion
             of all that dies
   we held in common
   because without it
 
we become more common than the dust.
 
 
                             2.
 
Clay cannot create her features
nor mirror reveal her mouth
 
Photograph not show her form
full with self, so put away
 
her picture from the shelf
And turn instead to living
 
woman on the couch, decked with flowers
as if it were she laid out,
 
and not Sylvia, in the woods.
 
 
                              3.
 
Address to the Woman
 
Tell her that may not rise again
she sings still in our breath.
 
Tell her that may not breathe again
she moves yet beneath the moon.
 
Tell her that may not weave again
her hands are dawns within our eyes.
 
Tell her that may not speak again
Her words are warnings in the wood."
1565,Supplication,John Wieners,"O poetry, visit this house often,
imbue my life with success,
leave me not alone,
give me a wife and home.
 
Take this curse off
of early death and drugs,
make me a friend among peers,
lend me love, and timeliness.
 
Return me to the men who teach
and above all, cure the
hurts of wanting the impossible
through this suspended vacuum.

1566,The Difference Between Pepsi and Coke,David Lehman,"Can't swim; uses credit cards and pills to combat
               intolerable feelings of inadequacy;
Won't admit his dread of boredom, chief impulse behind
​               numerous marital infidelities;
Looks fat in jeans, mouths clichés with confidence,
​               breaks mother's plates in fights;
Buys when the market is too high, and panics during
​               the inevitable descent;
Still, Pop can always tell the subtle difference
​               between Pepsi and Coke,
Has defined the darkness of red at dawn, memorized
​               the splash of poppies along
Deserted railway tracks, and opposed the war in Vietnam
​               months before the students,
Years before the politicians and press; give him
​               a minute with a road map
And he will solve the mystery of bloodshot eyes;
​               transport him to mountaintop
And watch him calculate the heaviness and height
​               of the local heavens;
Needs no prompting to give money to his kids; speaks
​               French fluently, and tourist German;
Sings Schubert in the shower; plays pinball in Paris;
​               knows the new maid steals, and forgives her."
1567,For I Will Consider Your Dog Molly,David Lehman,"For it was the first day of Rosh Ha'shanah, New Year's Day, day of remembrance, of ancient sacrifices and averted calamities.
For I started the day by eating an apple dipped in honey, as ritual required.
For I went to the local synagogue to listen to the ram's horn blown.
For I asked Our Father, Our King, to save us for his sake if not for ours, for the sake of his abundant mercies, for the sake of his right hand, for the sake of those who went through fire and water for the sanctification of his name.
For despite the use of a microphone and other gross violations of ceremony, I gave myself up gladly to the synagogue's sensual insatiable vast womb.
For what right have I to feel offended?
For I communed with my dead father, and a conspicuous tear rolled down my right cheek, and there was loud crying inside me.
For I understood how that tear could become an orb.
For the Hebrew melodies comforted me.
For I lost my voice.
For I met a friend who asked ""is this a day of high seriousness"" and when I said yes he said ""it has taken your voice away.""
For he was right, for I felt the strong lashes of the wind lashing me by the throat.
For I thought there shall come a day that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God.
For the virgin shall rejoice in the dance, and the young and old in each other's arms, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and neither shall they learn war any more.
For God shall lower the price of bread and corn and wine and oil, he shall let our cry come up to him.
For it is customary on the first day of Rosh Ha'shanah to cast a stone into the depths of the sea, to weep and pray to weep no more.
For the stone represents all the sins of the people.
For I asked you and Molly to accompany me to Cascadilla Creek, there being no ocean nearby.
For we talked about the Psalms of David along the way, and the story of Hannah, mother of Samuel, who sought the most robust bard to remedy her barrenness.
For Isaac said ""I see the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the offering?""
For as soon as I saw the stone, white flat oblong and heavy, I knew that it had summoned me.
For I heard the voice locked inside that stone, for I pictured a dry wilderness in which, with a wave of my staff, I could command sweet waters to flow forth from that stone.
For I cast the stone into the stream and watched it sink to the bottom where dozens of smaller stones, all of them black, gathered around it.
For the waterfall performed the function of the chorus.
For after the moment of solemnity dissolved, you playfully tossed Molly into the stream.
For you tossed her three times, and three times she swam back for her life.
For she shook the water off her body, refreshed.
For you removed the leash from her neck and let her roam freely.
For she darted off into the brush and speared a small gray moving thing in the neck.
For this was the work of an instant.
For we looked and behold! the small gray thing was a rat.
For Molly had killed the rat with a single efficient bite, in conformance with Jewish law.
For I took the rat and cast him into the stream, and both of us congratulated Molly.
For now she resumed her noble gait.
For she does not lie awake in the dark and weep for her sins, and whine about her condition, and discuss her duty to God.
For I'd as lief pray with your dog Molly as with any man.
For she knows that God is her savior.

1568,Mythologies,David Lehman,"I.
 
The question is not how like the animals we are
But how we got that way. We laugh, for what is a suicide note
 
But the epitaph of an emotion? Few of us die out in the open;
And when you say thesis, I say antithesis,
 
But we don’t stop there: we take our opposing ideas,
Plant them on opposing cliffs and then build a footbridge
 
Between them, seemingly flimsy yet sturdy enough in fact
To support a battalion. Hidden behind trees, we watch
 
The soldiers march across it, single file, too scared
To look down. We cheer them all, all except the boy
 
In the fairy tale who knew no fear. Him we pity.
He laughs open-eyed, ready to die as we were not.
 
He is one of us, all right, but better, stronger, stranger.
He asks for more fear than anyone can bear.
 
 
II.
 
The guilty had three choices: awkward chords of candor,
Canned laughter, or the wild hyacinth’s sutra, before
 
Silence returned triumphant, and the journey resumed
In darkness, though the sky above was classically blue.
 
Everyone kept his opinion to himself
As harmony dictated, and effigies of Tristan and Isolde
 
Accompanied their stubborn footsteps across the wild
Terrain. Yet the longing for a loud catharsis
 
At night renewed their pain. “If only we could climb
Out of these clouds and heartfelt headaches,
 
Like ravished children in the glory of a snowball fight
After school, and never again have to descend,
 
Who would not abandon these erotic shipwrecks
And fall asleep like tigers in the destined heights?”
 
 
III.
 
At a festival of conceptual art in Cairo,
I saw a tank buried entirely in snow.
 
I knew then that silence is the source
Of all music, all laughter, all thought, and so
 
I stuffed pebbles in my mouth and stood by the sea
And roared my defiance of the waves. It was here,
 
Years before, that our plane and its shadow
Converged: I ran from the fire, carrying the flames
 
In my arms. I ran and ran, feeling like a man
Fighting a newspaper on a windy beach, but it wasn’t
 
A beach at all: the sand beneath me was snow,
Is snow, and the spears in the desert sky look like stars.
 
In the pyramid’s triangular shadow, I was the man
Who heard the crimson explosion, and ran. And ran.
 
 
IV.
 
Keats in one of his letters says, “My Imagination
Is a Monastery and I am its Monk.” I wonder.
 
If a man’s imagination is his monastery,
This place looks a lot like an empty railway station,
 
King’s Cross in London or the Gare St. Lazare in Paris,
A place whose smoke and fog Monet dissolved
 
Into a chorus of colors. There we stood, my love and I,
Having made our vows under the suspended clock,
 
Hero and bride. But as we walked away, side by side,
Down the station’s sunless nave, amid the excitement
 
Of the crowd, and foreign languages spoken loud,
We knew our exile had already begun, could hear
 
The conductor’s shrill whistle, could see the light
At the end of the tunnel, where the battlefields begin.
 
 
V.
 
Paradise was hardly what Psyche
With her bleeding blackberries and nervous orgasms
 
Could have foretold, enjoyed,
And renounced for the sake of some querulous abstraction
 
Designed to keep us unhappy but alive.
Call it civilization. Call our disobedience instinctive.
 
Or say we obeyed an angry muse, who ordered us to dance.
“Or else?” I asked. She sighed before answering.
 
“Or else a dismal armchair will be your lot
With chamber music your sole narcotic—music that will make
 
You face your former self, and grieve over incidents
Scarcely recalled, and eat without pleasure, and drink
 
Without thirst, and dread what shall never come to pass.”
In the revelation of our nakedness, we danced.
 
 
VI.
 
“A ball that is caught is fuller, by the weight
Of its return, than the same ball thrown.” Our empty hands say so.
 
We feel free. In the other room the true believers remain,
The ones who insist that evil is real, the only real thing.
 
Cannibals and missionaries they are, accomplices in sin,
Greedy for punishment, to inflict or endure it.
 
We are glad to leave them behind, glad not to have to hear
Their chants and wails. Down the elevator we go
 
And out into the canyon created by skyscraper shadows.
Yet even we, dedicated as we are to good living,
 
Sometimes walk around with a lost look on our faces,
As if the blessing for a piece of fruit or cup of wine
 
Had suddenly come to mind, though cup and plate are empty;
Had come to mind and faded almost instantly away.
 
 
VII.
 
Admit it: you used to walk around thinking there had
To be a reason for things, for everything. That way
 
Paranoia lies. Not a science of syllables, the solitude
Total, but the prophet’s lit lantern was what you wanted—
 
And what you got was “neon in daylight,” a pleasure
Recommended by Frank O’Hara. Those pleasures meant a lot to you,
 
You even thought you lived for them, until the first death
(A nervous uncle broke the news when you landed at Kennedy)
 
And the first marriage (you stayed up all night and read
 Beyond the Pleasure Principle, a fair description
 
Of your lovemaking). It seems that new myths are needed
And consumed all the time by folks like you. Each erases the last,
 
Producing tomorrow’s tabula rasa, after a night of dreams
In which the tigers of wrath become the tigers of repose.
 
 
VIII.
 
 
Go back to the beginning, to the first fist fight.
They played for high stakes those days. The penalty for losing
 
Was death or slavery, take your pick. To spare a life
Was the mark of the master; the mark of his slave
 
Was fear. Noble savage, nothing. Forget about paradise.
My vote goes to Hobbes’s “life of man, solitary, poor,
 
Nasty, brutish, and short.” An amazing sentence:
The syllable that ends it also lends it its poignancy,
 
Since we go on wanting what we can scarcely bear.
Go back, go back, back to when god became a swan
 
With beautiful wounded wings, and raped the astonished maiden.
Back to the dream that stays real when you wake up,
 
Accustomed to your hunger and clinging to it,
Like a panther accustomed to his cage. Go back.
 
 
IX.
                       
A slap in the face, and the face burns with shame.
Anger comes later, comes stranger, looking for someone to blame.
 
End of message. Can’t see the stars;
Can’t say anything that hasn’t been said before
 
By somebody slamming the door; can only repeat
The syntax that brought the crowd to its feet
 
In the silence that appeased the nightingale.
End of tale. But its moral was simple:
 
I lost the hearing in one of my ears
And listened with the other to a deaf man’s
 
Symphony. He built a heaven out of his fears
That there wasn’t one. End of nightmare.
 
—The imperfect past, going by too fast,
Begged us to collect it. It couldn’t last.
 
 
 
X.
 
The doctor put his cards on the table.
“Take your pick,” he said. He was able
 
To offer me fear of extinction or fear of pain,
Though freedom from neither. “You mustn’t complain.”
 
In the vertiginous air, the monks wore masks
To keep their germs to themselves and their
 
Identities a secret. A hero to his own valet,
The Sultan choreographed his murderous ballet
 
Until Scheherazade, entering the circus tent
With John the Baptist’s head on a silver tray,
 
Told her tale and made the crowd repent.
The curtain dropped and the crowd went on its way,
 
But no one could say what the nightmare meant,
Or why it was sent to us, or by whom it was sent.
 
 
XI.
 
You can’t have it, so you want it, or
You couldn’t have it, so you no longer want it, or
 
You’re stuck with it, forever. It was designed with you in mind,
Like the locked door that swung open majestically when you
 
Spoke the magic words or just answered in the affirmative when
Your name was called. “Here I am, ready to meet you,
 
Ready to make any sacrifice,” you said,
Still in bed, wrestling with an evil angel
 
In your sleep. You were seventeen years old then
And woke up with a limp. Desire is like that:
 
The girl knows what you want and cries when
She gives it to you because it was yours because
 
She whispered your name in your sleeping ear
And said: “Here I am.” And was gone a minute later.
 
 
XII.
 
I met her in one of those sleazebag bars—
I think it was called The Bottom Line—in Buffalo,
 
Self-proclaimed “city of no illusions,” where
Silent men in shirtsleeves sit on bar stools and watch
 
Girls with tattoos on their buttocks strip
Down to g-strings and panties. They dance to the thump
 
Of moronic music, grind and hump under hot strobe lights,
And then, when the act is over, circulate among the scumbags,
 
Gyrating in front of each in turn, making each feel special,
And each, aroused by the mingled smell of musk and sweat,
 
Folds a dollar and sticks it into her crotch for a tip.
She was different. When I left the bar that night I knew
 
She would follow, and she did, and I never looked back, never
Glanced at the rear-view mirror. All other women turned into her.
 
 
XIII.
 
Her name was Mary but was Miriam before that and soon
She will change it to Alice. What she offered was a shadow
 
The shape of Europe on the map above the bed of my youth.
Her shawl is all that remains of Europe in the downstairs closet.
 
It was forbidden to lift up her skirt and look, look.
Yet boys and girls danced across the bridal morning like a bridge
 
As the wings of the fog like white sails lingered
Across the bay. I flew, like a caterpillar with wings, into a new day.
 
That was the day we buried Europe. We built a dome in air
And in the icy silence of the tomb. To hang like a spider
 
On a subway strap seemed a suitable fate for some, but we
Lit a candle and watched it cast the shadow of a mountain
 
In a valley. It was the awful shadow of some unseen power,
A heaven in a wild flower. Europe, bloody Europe was gone.
 
 
XIV.
 
In the dream of your choice, you wake up
In the Garden of Eden, alone except for a whore with a heart,
 
Wearing a nurse’s uniform. The serpent says:
Listen carefully. This is for your own good.
 
At the tone it will be eight o’clock.
Nine out of ten physicians recommend
 
That you surround yourself with the kind of sorrows
That can be instantly relieved by frivolous kisses,
 
With vegetables as lush as fruits
Ripening in your hands. When the hospital gates are opened,
 
Don’t hesitate, run! And when you arrive at last in the land
Of the free, take your place in line with all of the others
 
As though nothing had happened between then and now
To make you doubt the conviction that you’re blessed.
 
 
XV.
 
If you were a painter, you’d paint the wind
Green. It would shake the boughs of the honey locust trees.
 
It would chase the leaves across the continent.
It would scatter their crumbs in a twist of swirling snow.
 
It would be colorless and green at the same time,
The wind that aligns the pond and the cloud,
 
The wind that is everywhere, in constant motion,
As buoyant as Ariel and as scornful of gross Caliban,
 
The wind that holds up the fly ball, drives it back
Into fair territory, causes it to drift within reach
 
Of the right-fielder, who waves off the second baseman,
Until a last gust lifts the ball over both their heads
 
And it lands safely for the double that ends the game
In extra innings, costing our team the pennant.
 
 
XVI.
 
After the flood, refreshed, was the first time
You realized that the road to truth was the road
 
Of flagrant fiction. You surrounded yourself
With symbols (a mountain, a window, an ark,
 
A rainbow) and mythic creatures (the dove that returned
And the raven that didn’t). You understood the dream
 
Of the old woman who interpreted the sailor’s dream.
Then came the other birds, the clouds that come
 
When the rain is done, and the wind that signals
The discovery of dry land, a new continent,
 
As the report of a gun sounds the start of the race,
As the bottle broken beneath the bridegroom’s foot
 
Begins the marriage, as church bells start the funeral
Parade and all the townspeople march in the procession.
 
 
XVII.
 
No longer is there freedom in confusion,
Nor forgiveness in confession,
 
Nor charm in the old illusion
Of moonlight, the tower, the howling dog, the escaping lovers,
 
Escaping into midnight in the Western hemisphere,
When the possibilities of expansion still seemed limitless
 
And the soul could choose among stars without number
In the vast velvet night without end.
 
—In the midst of other woe than ours, I went to the window
And cured the solitude of the listeners outside
 
Who shivered in the rain, waiting for the police to come
And ambulance sirens to sound. Drunk I was when
 
I went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and said,
“Dad, Dad, is that you?” In the terror of the night.
 
 
XVIII.
 
“Wherever you follow,” he said, “I will lead.”
Where summer met fall, she picked up a brittle orange leaf.
 
He wanted to lie on the grass, to lean and loaf
At his ease, but the crisis intervened: news of her unpaid loan
 
Prompted him to put his sandals on his head, as in the Zen koan.
Slowly he walked away. Silence followed, then the sound of a moan
 
In the room next door. So orange it seemed a painted moon
Shone against the indigo sky. And quickly her mood
 
Went from unreasonable euphoria to realistic dejection, as the wood
In the fireplace turned to ash without first yielding a flame. The wool
 
Of their sweaters had begun to unravel. “If the fool
Persists in his folly,“ someone said, “he will have food
 
Enough to eat, loaves and fishes galore. Worship the good,
Which is beautiful though untrue. Turn your back on gold.”
 
 
XIX.
 
If we were painters we’d favor vibrant stripes,
Primary colors, flat surfaces, a lot of white
 
Remaining on the canvas. If we were composers
We’d take the music of exotic jungles with us
 
When we visit the vast vacant tundra. “If I were
Rich enough,”﻿ vowed the philanthropist, “I’d move
 
To a magnolia mansion and spend my days
Translating modern literature into ancient Greek.”
 
Great plans, distant vistas, a rearguard action
To sabotage the present—and here we’ve all assembled,
 
At the antiseptic airport, with haunted looks on our faces.
Occasional eye contact between man with tan and woman in white.
 
“You look like your voice,” she says, breaking the silence.
The rest of us know where we’re going, but we don’t know when.

They’ve cornered the market on moral outrage. Yes, they have.
The more noise they make about it, the more nervous we get.
 
They’re always telling us just how shallow we are.
The only convictions we have, they say, are on our driver’s licenses.
 
The charge is not entirely fair to us, though it has its grain of truth.
We tend to luxuriate in our indecisiveness. Not they. No one can say
 
They lack conviction and passion and certitude. We have our doubts,
Which make us less glamorous and give us
 
The haunted look we wear. But something in defense
Of our bemused spectatorship must be said: at least it spares us
 
The postures of those hypocrite lechers, brothers and others
Who sublimate their sexuality into opulent rhetoric and chide us
 
For not doing the same. They have our best interests at heart.
They may even be happier than we are. We have our doubts.

Today’s graffiti is in the sky: “More than meets the eye.”
Growing up I could tell the months by their smell.
 
First come the fruitstand smells of spring in the city,
Then the backyard trees get back their green, and we know
 
It’s the real thing. Poetry is this puzzle of missing parts
Is best represented by clouds in the early evening sky,
 
Because they constantly change shape, are utterly indifferent
To us, and seem both remote and near at hand
 
At once. The creation of the world is a ballet
With the dancers and music missing: what you see
 
Is a miniature stage-set in a museum display case,
And then suddenly you are walking in it, along the Boulevard Raspail,
 
Until the Eiffel Tower comes into view. Watch it organize
The bridges of the Seine into a coherent surprise.

Love accompanies the stranger to his streetlamp
Encircled by signing insects. The song he hears
 
Meant doom or wax in the mariners’﻿ ears.
And now, as the smell of fresh cut grass gives way to the smell
 
Of brown leaves burning, I want to tell
You what I heard that night, and how the day
 
Erased it: I woke to the rattle of a passing car
Which, accelerating up the rapidly rising ramp,
 
Seemed delighted with its capacity for making noise. From far away
I could hear it coming. And just as we know that fame isn’t all
 
It’s cracked up to be, that it can be downright
Nasty in fact, and yet we want it anyway,
 
So I, too, knew I belonged in one of those cars, tall
Behind the steering wheel, racing to meet the changing light.

Winter came last. Waves of snow from who knows which wind
Turned the meadow beside the frozen waterfall
 
Into an ocean. The boy in the fairy tale who knew no fear
Soon learned. On the shore of the wide world he could hear
 
The violins of anger, spelling danger. Poetry in this era of disbelief
Meant staring at a leaf until it turned into a star.
 
It was easier in the past. All you had to do was sleep outside
And let nature take over. There were more stars in the sky
 
Than we had room for in our philosophy. And when we woke,
Berries grew beside the burbling brook and bled in our soft hands.
 
The question was not how like the gods we were
But whether we could recognize them in our sleep
 
And remember what we had seen, remember them clearly,
When the radio alarm welcomes us into its next musical day.

I live in a boat in front of the door
Depicting the gods as they might have been forgotten
 
By Lazarus during the tortures of interrogation.
What I see are tombs and yellow stains on the snow.
 
Instead of quotations, I will refer to my heart,
Instead of an altar, I will guard the munitions
 
And drink wine with the sour taste of cork
And eat sour strawberries in the city of New York.
 
You who’ve been looking for a lost address,
And mothers who seem to be fighting back their tears,
 
What made you think you could resist the roar
Of the years as they echo in a cavernous subway station?
 
Can you see the boat in front of the door?
What was it you forgot during the interrogation?
 
 
XXV.
 
Ovid had it wrong. The plight of the frightened maiden
Gliding noiselessly into the woods, like a deer whose eyes
 
Had been mesmerized by headlights on a cold November night,
Was implausible without the contrivance of arrows: love’s dart
 
Claimed Apollo while the dart of fear pierced Daphne’s heart,
And so she ran, deeper and deeper into the woods, losing ground
 
All the while to Apollo (for love moved faster than fear),
Until the gods, granting her wish, turned the nymph
 
Into a laurel, which Apollo hopelessly embraced. Poetic justice?
Yes, except it didn’t happen that way. Their foot race ended
 
In a forest clearing, where Daphne, exhausted but unashamed,
Made Apollo watch her undress. He entered her
 
At her request, as if his will were an extension of her own.
The trees, inclining their branches, nodded in consent. Love won.

The boy, who was more eager than his father
To live on a raft, sleep in the woods, and study the stars,
 
Became his father, but not before he hid in a cave, slept in it
Overnight, and was saved by a spider from sure destruction.
 
The king’s soldiers, hot on his trail, saw the web stretch unbroken
In the mouth of the cave, and assumed that no one was there.
 
What is the correct interpretation of the spider’s web?
To the soldiers it meant desolation; to the spider, conquest;
 
To the grandfather telling the tale, providence. The boy
Sees the dew cling to the web at dawn. The natural camouflage
 
Of rabbits and snakes isn’t lost on him. He notices
The triangle formed by three birds in the bare-branched sycamore.
 
He can hear the hum of a bee admiring a tulip’s genitalia.
And at night, he knows, all the colors are present in the white of the stars.

That was the year I first read Hölderlin.
The evening fell more slowly and the first day of spring
 
Arrived more suddenly and stayed lovelier longer.
Boys pursued muses and girls impersonated them.
 
With the instinct of insects, He and She on the meadow
Mate. What they dreamed stays real when they wake up
 
In the evening of the first day of spring.
Did they fall out of paradise or were they pushed?
 
It’s unclear, but we next see them enter the gathering dusk,
Hand in hand, and the camera pulls back and the voiceover says,
 
“Good fortune is even harder to bear
Than the bad fortune that came first. Remember this
 
About the gods: their own immortality suffices them.
The source of all rivers is a riddle even I cannot solve.”
 
 
XXVIII.
 
How little I have changed since then, or how much
Of the change is in the eyes of the beholder
 
Of a book I lived rather than wrote, whose author
Seems like a stranger to me today. I remember,
 
For example, wanting to write an apocalyptic parody
Of Milton, in Milton’s high style, titled “Eden in Flames.”
 
Adam and Eve celebrated their carnality, and when they woke,
The branches of the fruit trees curved gracefully down
 
And served them nectar. I couldn’t bring myself to describe
Their banishment, and so the project failed. Yet what I heard
 
When I slept sounded a lot like the chorus of joy
In Beethoven’s Ninth, and what I saw when I woke up,
 
If only for the length of a dream, was a deer,
Eyes mesmerized by headlights, motionless in the middle of the road.

You could be the only passenger on the bus
Who notices that the driver is blind. I, by contrast,
 
Have eyes only for lovely you. Give me your hand.
I will kiss it. You are cordially invited to my studio,
 
Which resembles a psychiatrist’s office. Once there, I put on my glasses,
Read passages out loud from Plato, Hobbes, Marx, and Freud,
 
And ask you for your opinion of each. Together we analyze
Solitude. There is a meeting of the minds,
 
And sex follows. It’s the first day of spring and we want
To walk along the river and roll on the grass and take off
 
Our clothes while leaving the windows wide open. In fact,
We can’t wait to get off this bus, which seems to be going
 
Nowhere fast, as Spring puts her tongue in my ear
And names the forbidden parts of her body.
 
 
XXX.
 
No one could say what the nightmare meant
In the operating theater or the circus tent.
 
And none of this will help us pay the rent:
Many are called and sleep through the ringing,
 
But we know it’s spring, though we’ve thrown our watches away.
Our dreams, stretching across the chasm of day.
 
Don’t deter us from waking, jumping into our clothes,
Dancing down the avenue, and swinging through
 
The revolving doors of the future, where we used to live,
The day before yesterday, when we weren’t dying.
 
—The question is whether the raven will return
After his end-of-the-world adventures, after the storm
 
When one by one the masks slip off, and the bride embraces
The guilty son: true to the test, remembered and confessed.

1569,Ode,David Lehman,"People in the middle ages didn't think they were living
Between two more important and enlightened eras;
Nor did they see themselves as the players
In act three of a tragedy in five acts.
It was not always late winter in the middle ages.
People in the middle ages were not all middle-aged
Though it is enjoyable on occasion to assume that they were.
The sun was as bright in the dark ages
As it is now—maybe a fraction brighter, in fact.
 
Think of the middle ages and what do you see:
Gloomy cathedrals, students dressed like monks in the rain,
Or a band of drunken pilgrims telling obscene jokes,
Or heroes embarking for the nearest wilderness come April?
Your answer will reveal yourself to yourself
But you may not know it—may choose to hide
In hazy visions of a serene and indescribable paradise.
And paradise, as we all know, may be paradise when we’re dead,
But is boredom on earth, alas.
 
We never think of ennui in relation to the middle ages.
Should we? Did Thomas Aquinas never get bored
Cooking up elaborate refutations of diminutive heresies?
No, and you shouldn’t either. Nor did the clerks
of Oxford tire of the sin against the Holy Ghost,
Trying to figure out what it was.
 
On chill September mornings when
I smoked too much the night before
And I drank too much the night before
And a sinister cough rises up
From the depths of the belly of my being,
I like to imagine living in Provence
Or even in Rheims during the middle ages.
﻿"
1570,Twenty Questions,David Lehman,"Why did the moth fly into the flame? Was it for the same reason
That Achilles died young? Who gets more fun out of sex,
The man or the woman? (Be sure to explain how you can tell.)
Which is more real to you, heaven or hell?
 
Why do sinners’ ways prosper? What causes the death of love—
The love of death? Did Adam and Eve have a choice?
Did the Virgin Mary? What are we afraid of, anyway?
Even agnostics have the right to say “thank god,” don’t they?
 
Looking at these dancing atoms, shall I say I saw a ring
Of pure and endless light? Or did I dream the whole thing?
Whom shall I say is calling? Are you in if it’s your wife?
Are you willing to relocate? Do you like your life?
 
What makes this night different from all other nights?
Would you say it’s your fate to be always,
Without exception, five minutes late? If you arrived
At 9:10, would the ceremony have started at 9:05
 
Though it had been scheduled for 9:15? As you walk down
The aisle, and the others rivet their attention to you,
Do you ask yourself what you’re going to do,
As though it mattered, as if you knew?

1571,Counting Backwards,Linda Pastan,"How did I get so old,
I wonder,
contemplating
my 67th birthday.
Dyslexia smiles:
I’m 76 in fact.

There are places
where at 60 they start
counting backwards;
in Japan
they start again
from one.

But the numbers
hardly matter.
It’s the physics
of acceleration I mind,
the way time speeds up
as if it hasn’t guessed

the destination—
where look!
I see my mother
and father bearing a cake,
waiting for me
at the starting line.﻿"
1572,Old Houses,Robert Cording,"Year after year after year
I have come to love slowly

how old houses hold themselves—

before November’s drizzled rain
or the refreshing light of June—

as if they have all come to agree
that, in time, the days are no longer
a matter of suffering or rejoicing.

I have come to love
how they take on the color of rain or sun
as they go on keeping their vigil

without need of a sign, awaiting nothing

more than the birds that sing from the eaves,
the seizing cold that sounds the rafters."
1573,Lone Egret,Kathleen M. McCann,"Classically stagy, goose-neck
elegant, river’s third eye.
Pencil thin head. S
for a throat. Skeleton of a saint.

Plodder, preening posturer.
One foot,
another.
Up from the dank weeds.﻿"
1574,A History Without Suffering,E. A. Markham,"In this poem there is no suffering.
It spans hundreds of years and records
no deaths, connecting when it can,
those moments where people are healthy
 
and happy, content to be alive. A Chapter,
maybe a Volume, shorn of violence
consists of an adult reading aimlessly.
This line is the length of a full life
 
smuggled in while no one was plotting
against a neighbour, except in jest.
Then, after a gap, comes Nellie. She
is in a drought-fisted field
 
 with a hoe. This is her twelfth year
on the land, and today her back
doesn’t hurt. Catechisms of self-pity
and of murder have declared a day’s truce
 
in the Civil War within her. So today,
we can bring Nellie, content with herself,
with the world, into our History.
For a day. In the next generation
 
we find a suitable subject camping
near the border of a divided country:
for a while no one knows how near. For these
few lines she is ours. But how about
 
the lovers? you ask, the freshly-washed
body close to yours; sounds, smells, tastes;
anticipation of the young, the edited memory
of the rest of us? How about thoughts
 
higher than their thinkers?...Yes, yes.
Give them half a line and a mass of footnotes:
they have their own privileged history,
like inherited income beside our husbandry.
 
We bring our History up to date
in a city like London: someone’s just paid
the mortgage, is free of guilt
and not dying of cancer; and going
 
past the news-stand, doesn’t see a headline
advertising torture. This is all
recommended reading, but in small doses.
It shows you can avoid suffering, if you try. ﻿"

 Several of my ancestors used their pens
  
 in odd ways.
  
 A child of seven I prayed for breath.
  
 Each day I passed through the mirrored X

 I never regretted this situation.

 Twenty years later I burned all my furniture.
  
 Likewise the beams of my house

 I abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams

 What I like most is to stay in my apartment.
  
 So that is my life, pared of anecdotes.
  
  
  
 I go out occasionally to look at a dance.
  
 Otherwise the usual joys, worries and inner mourning.
  
 Occasionally in an old boat I navigate the river
  
 when I find the time.
  
 Water swallows the days.
  
 I think maybe that’s all
  
  
  
 I have to say
  
 except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me.
  
 It says, A candle is consuming a children’s alphabet.
  
 It says, Attend to each detail of the future-past.

 Today a terrifying wind."
1577,H,Michael Palmer,"Yet the after is still a storm
as witness bent shadbush
 and cord grass in stillness
  
 sand littered with the smallest of fragments
 whether shell or bone
 That city we are far from
  
 is still frozen, still in ruins
 (except its symmetries be renewed
 by sleep, its slant colors redeemed)
  
 Nothing has changed but its name
 and the air that it breathes
 There’s still no truth in making sense
  
 while the ash settles, so fine that
 planes keep falling from the sky
 And the name once again to be the old one
  
 Saint Something, Saint Gesture, Saint Entirely the Same
 as if nothing or no one had been nameless in the interim
 or as if still could be placed beside storm
  
 that simply, as in a poem
 Have you heard the angels with sexed tongues,
 met the blind boy who could see with his skin,
  
 his body curled inward like a phrase,
 like an after in stillness or a letter erased
 Have you seen what’s written on him
  
 as question to an answer or calendar out of phase
 Add up the number of such days
 Add illness and lilt as formed on the tongue
  
 Add that scene identical with its negative,
 that sentence which refuses to speak,
 present which cannot be found"
1578,Twenty-four Logics in Memory of Lee Hickman,Michael Palmer,"The bend in the river followed us for days
and above us the sun
 doubled and redoubled its claims
  
 Now we are in a house
 with forty-four walls
 and nothing but doors
  
 Outside the trees, chokecherries, mulberries and oaks
 are cracking like limbs
 We can do nothing but listen
  
 or so someone claims,
 the Ice Man perhaps, all enclosed in ice
 though the light has been shortening our days
  
 and coloring nights the yellow of hay,
 scarlet of trillium, blue of block ice
 Words appear, the texture of ice,
  
 with messages etched on their shells:
 Minna 1892, Big Max and Little Sarah,
 This hour ago
  
 everyone watched as the statues fell
 Enough of such phrases and we’ll have a book
 Enough of such books
  
 and we’ll have mountains of ice
 enough to balance our days with nights
 enough at last to close our eyes"
1579,The Craftsman,Marcus B. Christian,"I ply with all the cunning of my art
This little thing, and with consummate care
I fashion it—so that when I depart,
Those who come after me shall find it fair
And beautiful. It must be free of flaws—
Pointing no laborings of weary hands;
And there must be no flouting of the laws
Of beauty—as the artist understands.
 
Through passion, yearnings infinite—yet dumb—
I lift you from the depths of my own mind
And gild you with my soul’s white heat to plumb
The souls of future men. I leave behind
This thing that in return this solace gives:
“He who creates true beauty ever lives.”

1581,After a Rainstorm,Robert Wrigley,"Because I have come to the fence at night,
the horses arrive also from their ancient stable.
They let me stroke their long faces, and I note
in the light of the now-merging moon

how they, a Morgan and a Quarter, have been
by shake-guttered raindrops
spotted around their rumps and thus made
Appaloosas, the ancestral horses of this place.

Maybe because it is night, they are nervous,
or maybe because they too sense
what they have become, they seem
to be waiting for me to say something

to whatever ancient spirits might still abide here,
that they might awaken from this strange dream,
in which there are fences and stables and a man
who doesn’t know a single word they understand."
1582,"Book 1, Epigram 34: Ad. Thomam Freake armig. de veris adventu.   ﻿",Thomas Bastard,"The welcome Sun from sea Freake is returned,
 And cheereth with his beams the naked earth,
 Which gains with his coming her apparel
 And had his absence six long months mourned.
 Out of her fragrant sides she sends to greet him
 The rashed primrose and the violet;
 While she the fields and meadows doth beset
 With flowers, and hangs the trees with pearl to meet him.
 Amid this hope and joy she doth forget,
 To kill the hemlock which doth grow too fast,
 And chill the adder making too much haste,
 With his black sons revived with the heat;

 How many strange Meanders do I find?
 How many paths do turn my straying pen?
 How many doubtful twilights make me blind,
 Which seek to limb out this strange All of men?
 Easy it were the earth to portray out,
 Or to draw forth the heavens’ purest frame,
 Whose restless course, by order whirls about
 Of change and place, and still remains the same.

 He saw my case, and then of courtesy
 Did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in,

For we have sucked the sweet and sap away,
And sowed consumption in the fruitful ground;
The woods and forests clad in rich array
With nakedness and baldness we confound.
We have defaced the lasting monuments,
And caused all honour to have end with us;
The holy temples feel our ravishments.
What can our heirs inherit but our curse?
The world must end, for men are so accurst;
Unless God end it sooner, they will first."
1592,"Book 5, Epigram 20: In Misum & Mopsam.",Thomas Bastard,"Misus and Mopsa hardly could agree,
 Striving about superiority. 
 The text which says that man and wife are one,
 Was the chief argument they stood upon.  
 She held they both one woman should become,
 He held both should be man, and both but one. 
      So they contended daily, but the strife
      Could not be ended, till both were one wife."
1593,"Book 6, Epigram 14: De Piscatione.  ﻿",Thomas Bastard,"Fishing, if I a fisher may protest,
 Of pleasures is the sweetest, of sports the best,
 Of exercises the most excellent. 
 Of recreations the most innocent. 
 But now the sport is marred, and what, ye, why?
 Fishes decrease, and fishers multiply.
 ﻿"
1594,"Book 6, Epigram 17: In Sextum.  ﻿",Thomas Bastard,"Sextus upon a spleen, did rashly swear,
 That no new fashion he would ever wear.
 He was forsworn, for see what did ensue,
 He wore the old, till the old was the new. 
 ﻿"
1595,"Book 6, Epigram 30",Thomas Bastard,"Upon the plain as I rode all alone,
 Assaulted by two sturdy lads I was;
 I am a poor man Sires, let me be gone. 
 Nay, but ye shall be poor before ye pass. 
      And so I was: yet lost nothing thereby. 
      Would they had robbed me of my poverty. 
 ﻿"
1596,"Book 6, Epigram 7: In prophanationem nominis Dei. ﻿",Thomas Bastard,"God’s name is bare of honour in our hearing, 
 And even worn out with our blasphemous swearing. 
 Between the infant and the aged, both
 The first and last they utter, is an oath. 
 Oh hellish manners of our profane age. 
 Jehovah’s fear is scoffed upon the stage,
 The Mimicking jester, names it every day;
 Unless God is blashphem’d, it is no play. 
 ﻿"
1597,"Book 7, Epigram 36: De puero balbutiente.  ﻿",Thomas Bastard,"Methinks 'tis pretty sport to hear a child,
 Rocking a word in mouth yet undefiled. 
 The tender racket rudely plays the sound,
 Which weakly banded cannot back rebound,
 And the soft air the softer roof does kiss,
 With a sweet dying and a pretty miss,
 Which hears no answer yet from the white rank
 Of teeth, not risen from their coral bank. 
 The alphabet is searched for letters soft,
 To try a word before it can be wrought,
 And when it slides forth, it goes as nice, 
 As when a man does walk upon the ice. 
 ﻿"
1598,"Book 7, Epigram 42",Thomas Bastard,"Our vice runs beyond all that old men saw,
 And far authentically above our laws, 
 And scorning virtues safe and golden mean,
 Sits uncontrolled upon the high extreme. 
 Circes, thy monsters painted out the hue,
 Of feigned filthiness, but ours is true. 
 Our vice puts down all proverbs and all themes,
 Our vice excels all fables and all dreams.
 ﻿"
1599,"Book 7, Epigram 47: De Hominis Ortu & Sepultura.  ﻿",Thomas Bastard,"Nature which headlong into life doth throw us,
 With our feet forward to our grave doth bring us,
 What is less ours, than this our borrowed breath,
 We stumble into life, we go to death. 
 ﻿"
1601,Produce Wagon,Roy Scheele,"The heat shimmer along our street
one midsummer midafternoon,
and wading up through it a horse’s hooves,
and each shoe raising a tongueless bell
that tolled in the neighborhood,
till the driver drew in the reins
and the horse hung its head and stood.

And something in a basket thin
as shavings (blackberries? or a ghost
of the memory of having tasted them?)
passing into my hands as mother paid,
and the man got up again,
slapping the loop from the reins,
and was off on his trundling wagon.﻿"
1602,The Water Carriers,Angelo Giambra,"On hot days we would see them
leaving the hive in swarms. June and I
would watch them weave their way
through the sugarberry trees toward the pond
where they would stop to take a drink,
then buzz their way back, plump and full of water,
to drop it on the backs of the fanning bees.
If you listened you could hear them, their tiny wings
beating in unison as they cooled down the hive.
My brother caught one once, its bulbous body
bursting with water, beating itself against
the smooth glass wall of the canning jar.
He lit a match, dropped it in, but nothing
happened. The match went out and the bee
swam through the mix of sulfur and smoke
until my brother let it out. It flew straight
back to the hive. Later, we skinny-dipped
in the pond, the three of us, the August sun
melting the world around us as if it were
wax. In the cool of the evening, we walked
home, pond water still dripping from our skin,
glistening and twinkling like starlight.﻿"
1603,"The Crippled Girl, The Rose",David Ferry,"It was as if a flower bloomed as if
Its muttering root and stem had suddenly spoken,

Uttering on the air a poem of summer,
The rose the utterance of its root and stem.

Thus her beautiful face, the crippled girl’s,
Was like the poem spoken by her body—

The richness of that face!—most generous
In what it keeps, giving in its having.

The rose reserves the sweetness that it yields,
Petal on petal, telling its own silence,

Her beauty saying from its thorny stalk
That what it is is kept as it is given."
1604,From a Bridge,David St. John,"I saw my mother standing there below me
On the narrow bank just looking out over the river

Looking at something just beyond the taut middle rope
Of the braided swirling currents

Then she looked up quite suddenly to the far bank
Where the densely twined limbs of the cypress

Twisted violently toward the storm-struck sky
There are some things we know before we know

Also some things we wish we would not ever know
Even if as children we already knew      & so

Standing above her on that bridge that shuddered
Each time the river ripped at its wooden pilings

I knew I could never even fate willing ever
Get to her in time"
1605,The Guest Ellen at the Supper for Street People,David Ferry,"The unclean spirits cry out in the body
Or mind of the guest Ellen in a loud voice
Torment me not, and in the fury of her unclean
Hands beating the air in some kind of unending torment—
Nobody witnessing could possibly know the event   
That cast upon her the spell of this enchantment.

Almost all the guests are under some kind of enchantment:   
Of being poor day after day in the same body;
Of being witness still to some obscene event;
Of listening all the time to somebody’s voice
Whispering in the ear things divine or unclean,
In the quotidian of unending torment.

One has to keep thinking there was some source of torment,   
Something that happened someplace else, unclean.   
One has to keep talking in a reasonable voice
About things done, say, by a father’s body
To or upon the body of Ellen, in enchantment
Helpless, still by the unforgotten event

Enchanted, still in the old forgotten event
A prisoner of love, filthy Ellen in her torment,   
Guest Ellen in the dining hall in her body,
Hands beating the air in her enchantment,   
Sitting alone, gabbling in her garbled voice   
The narrative of the spirits of the unclean.

She is wholly the possessed one of the unclean.
Maybe the spirits came from the river. The enchantment   
Entered her, maybe, in the Northeast Kingdom. The torment,   
A thing of the waters, gratuitous event,
Came up out of the waters and entered her body
And lived in her in torment and cried out in her voice.

It speaks itself over and over again in her voice,   
Cursing maybe or not a familiar obscene event   
Or only the pure event of original enchantment   
From the birth of the river waters, the pure unclean   
Rising from the source of things, in a figure of torment   
Seeking out Ellen, finding its home in her poor body.

Her body witness is, so also is her voice,   
Of torment coming from unknown event;
Unclean is the nature and name of the enchantment."
1606,Impasse,Amanda Jernigan,"Sei allem Abschied voran: half

a line from Rilke’s Die Sonettean Orpheus as my motto,

I rehearsed my elegiac art(“be in advance of all parting”)

and won, I thought, with each song deeper,until I stood before the keeper

in whom I’ve come to recognize myself."
1607,In Eden,David Ferry,"You lie in our bed as if an orchard were over us.

You are what’s fallen from those fatal boughs.

Where will we go when they send us away from here?"
1608,In the High Country,David St. John,"Some days I am happy to be no one
The shifting grasses 

In the May winds are miraculous enough
As they ripple through the meadow of lupine

The field as iridescent as a Renaissance heaven
& do you see that boy with his arms raised 

Like one of Raphael’s angels held within
This hush & this pause & the sky’s lapis expanse?

That boy is my son & I am his only father
Even when I am no one"
1609,A Language,Susan Stewart,"I had heard the story before 
about the two prisoners, alone 
in the same cell, and one 
gives the other lessons in a language. 
Day after day, the pupil studies hard—
what else does he have to do?—and year 
after year they practice, 
waiting for the hour of release. 
They tackle the nouns, the cases, and genders, 
the rules for imperatives and conjugations, 
but near the end of his sentence, the teacher 
suddenly dies and only the pupil 
goes back through the gate and into the open 
world. He travels to the country of his new 
language, fluent, and full of hope. 
Yet when he arrives he finds 
that the language he speaks is not 
the language that is spoken. He has learned 
a language one other person knew—its inventor, 
his cell-mate and teacher.
                          And then the other 
evening, I heard the story again. 
This time the teacher was Gombrowicz, the pupil 
was his wife. She had dreamed of learning 
Polish and, hour after hour, for years 
on end, Gombrowicz had been willing to teach 
her a Polish that does not and never 
did exist. The man who told 
the story would like to marry his girlfriend. 
They love to read in bed and between
them speak three languages. 
They laughed—at the wife, at Gombrowicz, it wasn’t
clear, and I wasn’t sure that they 
themselves knew what was funny. 
I wondered why the man had told 
the story, and thought of the tricks 
enclosure can play. A nod, or silence, 
another nod, consent—or not, as a cloud 
drifts beyond the scene and the two 
stand pointing in different directions 
at the very same empty sky.
                           Even so, there was something 
else about the story, like teaching 
a stunt to an animal—a four-legged 
creature might prance on two legs 
or a two-legged creature might 
fall onto four.
                           ﻿I remembered, 
then, the miscarriage, and before that 
the months of waiting: like baskets filled 
with bright shapes, the imagination 
run wild. And then what arrived:
the event that was nothing, a mistaken idea, 
a scrap of charred cloth, the enormous 
present folding over the future, 
like a wave overtaking 
a grain of sand. 
                           There was a myth 
I once knew about twins who spoke 
a private language, though one 
spoke only the truth and the other 
only lies. The savior gets mixed 
up with the traitor, but the traitor 
stays as true to himself as a god. 

All night the rain falls here, falls there,
and the creatures dream, or drown, in the lair."
1610,Learning from History,David Ferry,"They said, my saints, my slogan-sayers sang,   
Be good, my child, in spite of all alarm.

They stood, my fathers, tall in a row and said,   
Be good, be brave, you shall not come to harm.

I heard them in my sleep and muttering dream,   
And murmuring cried, How shall I wake to this?

They said, my poets, singers of my song,   
We cannot tell, since all we tell you is

But history, we speak but of the dead.   
And of the dead they said such history

(Their beards were blazing with the truth of it)   
As made of much of me a mystery."
1611,Little Vietnam Futurist Poem,David Ferry,"She came into my view as vivid as
Somebody on a screen in a movie seen,
Elegant in the focus of my eye.

Birdboned. Quick and light. Not wearing pajamas.
The little run resembling playfulness.
Calling out something, screaming something or other

As if her little mouth was fervently singing,
As if you couldn’t hear what the words could be,
Because of the singing. I had her in my sight.

Other people were there, wearing pajamas, 
Streaming out of some hideyhole or other
Into the way that that was how I saw them.

The trees of the kind that grew there establish the place.
We know that way the story of what it was."
1612,The Manhattan Project,Spencer Reece,"First, J. Robert Oppenheimer wrote his paper on dwarf stars—“What happens to a massive star that burns out?” he asked. His calculations suggested that instead of collapsing it would contract indefinitely, under the force of its own gravity. The bright star would disappear but it would still be there, where there had been brilliance there would be a blank. Soon after, workers built Oak Ridge, the accumulation of Cemesto hutments not placed on any map. They built a church, a school, a bowling alley. From all over, families drove through the muddy ruts. The ground swelled about the ruts like flesh stitched by sutures. My father, a child, watched the loads on the tops of their cars tip. Gates let everyone in and out with a pass. Forbidden to tell anyone they were there, my father’s family moved in, quietly, behind the chain-link fence. Niels Bohr said, “This bomb might be our great hope.” My father watched his parents eat breakfast: his father opened his newspaper across the plate of bacon and eggs, his mother smoked Camel straights, the ash from her cigarette cometing across the back of the obituaries. They spoke little. Increasingly the mother drank Wild Turkey with her women friends from the bowling league. Generators from the 
y
-12 plant droned their ambition. There were no birds. General Leslie Groves marched the boardwalks, yelled, his boots pressed the slates and the mud bubbled up like viscera. My father watched his father enter the plant. My shy father went to the library, which was a trailer with a circus tent painted on the side. There he read the definition of “uranium” which was worn to a blur. My father read one Hardy Boys mystery after another. It was August 1945. The librarian smiled sympathetically at the 12-year-old boy. “Time to go home,” the librarian said. They named the bomb Little Boy. It weighed 9,700 pounds. It was the size of a go-kart. On the battle cruiser 
Augusta
, President Truman said, “This is the greatest thing in history.” That evening, my father’s parents mentioned Japanese cities. Everyone was quiet. It was the quiet of the exhausted and the innocent. The quietness inside my father was building and would come to define him. I was wrong to judge it. Speak, Father, and I will listen. And if you do not wish to speak, then I will listen to that."
1613,Mocking Bird Hotel,Valzhyna Mort,"A woman’s hallelujah! washes the foot of Mocking Bird 
Hill, her face eclipsed by her black mouth, 
her eyes rolled up like workman’s sleeves. 
Stirred up, a fly speaks in the tongue of the hotel 
doorbell, where, on the sun-ridden straw terrace 
my salvation means less than praise
to a dumb child. Damned, blinded by ice cubes, 
the fly surrenders its life into the waiter’s clean hands. 

Behind the kitchen of the Mocking Bird Hotel
a rooster repeats hallelujah! until it loses its head.
A man harvests the Family Tree before his forefathers’
features have a chance to ripen on their faces. Parakeets 
watch him from the bare nerves of the garden. He harvests 
before the worms that eat his father turn into demons.

Do not eat the fruit from your Family Tree. You have
eyes not to see them, hands not to pick them, teeth
not to bite them, tongue not to taste them even in speech. 
The waiter slashes the table with our bill. We descend 
Mocking Bird Hill without raising dust. Dogs, 
their fur hanging like wet feathers off their backs, 
piss yellow smoke without lifting a leg. Gulls 
smash their heads between their wings. 
Light lays the eggs of shadows under the shrubs. 
Produce shacks stand empty like football gates. 
What appeared blue from afar, turns green. 
                 I hold it all in, even my own urine. 
But the mother of vowels slumps from my throat 
like the queen of a havocked beehive. 

Higher than hallelujah! rising like smoke over the hill,
I scream at the top of that green lung, 
                                                                    why, in the Mocking Bird 
Hell, do you value your blood over your sweat,
that bitterness over this salt, that wound over this 
crystal? But often, to shed light on the darkness, light 
isn’t enough. Often what I need is even a darker
darkness. Like in those hours before the sun incriminates this
hotel, his two nostrils that illuminate our benighted bodies."
1614,Momma Said,Calvin Forbes,"The slice I ate I want it back
Those crumbs I swept up
I’d like my share again
I can still taste it like it was 

The memory by itself is delicious
Each bite was a small miracle 
Both nourishing and sweet 
I wish I had saved just a little bit 

I know it wasn’t a literal cake
It’s the thought that counts
Like a gift that’s not store-bought
Making it even more special  

Like a dream that makes you
Want to go back to sleep
You can’t have your cake
And eat it too Momma said 

I was defiant and hardheaded
And answered yes I can too
The look she gave me said boy 
I hope you aren’t a fool all your life"
1615,Movie Star Peter at the Supper for Street People,David Ferry,"The style a form of concealment the way style is.
His manners seemed a parody, almost, 
Of manners, a movie star of bygone days;

Strangely elaborate, highly stylized manners,
Complicit with his fame and with your praise;
Looking toward you and then away from you,

Star-like, movie-star-like, a dance routine,
The walk almost a glide, or elegant shuffle,
Always on the verge of veering away,

Circling away and over to the other side
Of the frozen skating arena that he was on;
A dancer’s courtesy, the courtesy,

I mean, of the dancer to the audience,
Flirtatious and familiar, only for you,
And entirely impersonal and withheld.

All of the above, though, maybe, misses the point,
Because it seems to say he knew about
What he was doing or what the style was for,

And nothing let one be sure that this was so;
A look on his face of amusement, as if he knew
A secret that he shared with you and yet

Kept to himself, as if it only showed 
The cryptogram but wouldn’t provide the key
To read it with. But could he read the code?

One night, late at night, as we were driving
Home from having had dinner out, in Boston,
We saw him figure skating through Charles Street Circle,

Right through and among the circling lights of cars
As if with champion skill on thin ice whirling
Oblivious to the astonished blaring horns,

As a dancer or skater seems, while dancing to
The music that we hear, oblivious to
The music that we hear and listening to

Some other music heard from somewhere else.
So Peter moved like a dancer or skater through 
And among the dangerous outraged cars as if

Untouchable and untouched and moving to
The sounds of something else from somewhere else—
The music maybe of his madness was it?

It was as if he skated in solitude
And glided whirling on a lonely tarn
Far out away from everything there is."
1616,Out at Lanesville,David Ferry,"In memoriam Mary Ann, 1932–1980

The five or six of them, sitting on the rocks 
Out at Lanesville, near Gloucester; it is like
Listening to music. Several of them are teachers,
One is a psychologist, one is reading a book,
The page glares white in the summer sunlight;
Others are just sunning themselves, or just
Sitting there looking out over the water;
A couple of them seem to be talking together;
From this far off you can’t hear what they are saying.

The day is hot, the absolute middle of summer.
Someone has written an obscenity 
In huge letters on the rocks above and behind
This group of people, and someone else, one of them,
Maybe, or maybe a neighbor, the owner of one
Of the cottages up behind and back in the woods,
Has tried to erase it and only partly done so,
So that for years it will say hoarsely fuck
To the random winds and to the senseless waves.

One of them is sitting with her back turned
To me and to the others on the rocks. The purple
Loosestrife and the tigerlilies are like the flags
Of some celebration; they bloom along the edge
Of a small stream that makes its way unseen
Down to the rocks and sand. Her shoulders are round,
And rather luxuriously heavy, and the whole figure
Has a youthful and graceful amplitude of being
Whose beauty will last her her whole life long.

The voices of some people out in a boat somewhere
Are carried in over the water with surprising
Force and clarity, though saying I don’t know what:
Happiness; unhappiness; something about the conditions
Of all such things; work done, not done; the saving
Of the self in the intense work of its singleness,
Learning to live with it. Their lives have separate ends.
Suddenly she turned her head and seems to look
Toward me and toward the others on the rocks,

So that her body, turned away, is more expressive
Than her blank face, a pure reflector of light."
1617,Pajama Quotient,Linda Gregerson,"Coinage of the not-yet-wholly-
             hardened custodians of public 
health, as health is roughly measured 
             ﻿in the rougher parts of Dearborn.

Meaning, how many parents,
             ﻿when things get bad, are wearing
what they’ve slept in when they come 
             ﻿to pick up the kids at school. 

The best of talk, said someone
             ﻿once, is shop talk: we can go 
to it as to a well. But manifolds
             ﻿and steering racks are going

the way of the wells—offshore—
             ﻿so the-nifty-thing-you-do-
with-the-wrench-when-the-foreman-
             ﻿has-sped-the-line-up

has become a ghastly shorthand for
             ﻿despair among the people
you are paid to help. Despair, 
             ﻿sometimes, of helping. In

the winter dawn a decade and a half
             ﻿ago, we’d gather around
the school bus stop—the unshaved
             ﻿fathers, mothers, dogs,

the siblings in their snowsuits—so
             ﻿the children bound for
Johnson Elementary might have
             ﻿a proper sending-off.
    
The privileged of the earth, in our
             ﻿case: words and stars
and molecules were all our care,
             ﻿a makeshift village blessed

with time and purpose. And
             ﻿a school bus stop,
to make it seem like life. By far my 
             ﻿favorites were the Russian

mathematicians: bathrobes hanging
             ﻿below their parkas, cigarettes
scattering ash, their little ones for the
             ﻿moment quite forgotten, they 

would cover the walls of the shelter 
             ﻿with what 
to most of us was Greek but was 
             ﻿no doubt of urgent consequence 

for quantum fields. So filled with joy: 
             ﻿their permanent markers on the  
brick. And then 
             ﻿the bus, and then the children off 

without us and our little human pretext 
             ﻿gone. Fragile the minutes.
Fragile the line between wonder
             ﻿and woe. The poet when he

wrote about our parents in the garden
             ﻿gave them love and rest
and mindfulness. But first 
             ﻿he gave them honest work."
1618,Prayer,Liz Waldner,"If I were in a book it would be the book
in which some lesser angel bemoans
the state of my soul

and is comforted for it
and is corrected for it

by some greater angel who knows
as the reader knows that it is not one’s soul
that suffers the indignities of ignobility: 
the inability to curb the petty smallness
of spirit, ungladness in the company
of bureaucrats, anger’s decay,

in the sense that my soul itself cannot be
harmed nor tarnished though it can witness
my sorrow on finding that illness alters me
from the self I thought I’d more or less known. 

What can one do about one’s nature?
I look at the spider that’s finally 
restrung its great wheel away from the door.

I’d like to close the door, go away,
leaving the spider be.
I’d like to preclude the possibility
of angel, as of prey."
1619,Sacramento O No,Liz Waldner,"An asparagus eating contest—
I thought I’d misheard.

Downstairs the rude old man
lays tile, makes demasiado noise.
I fell asleep at last around 5:30 am
and he woke me an hour later or so:
it is better I don’t look
at the clock. By this means
I clock my progress: I know now
it is sometimes better not to 
know. I have midnight equilibrium 
but it is gone by 3 am.

Thank you for Cloud of Sparrows,
man who wrote it. I read all night.
Thank you for the pen from Iran, Kamyar.
Its myriad stars have just run out of ink 
eleven years on.

Thank you, sun, for leaf shadows
on horrible carpet in horrible box
I live in and for tree by which I mean
what’s living. I think of the gardens
I planted and left. I think of beets,
of beans and asparagus. Then
on the radio, hear the contest.

The noise of ten lanes of traffic
does not cancel the consolation
of seeing the wind 
in the sweetgum leaves. 
The experience of this 
is my food and my sleep.

As at some strange customs,
I declare."
1620,Seen Through a Window,David Ferry,"A man and a woman are sitting at a table.
It is supper time. The air is green. The walls
Are white in the green air, as rocks under water
Retain their own true color, though washed in green.
I do not know either the man or the woman,
Nor do I know whatever they know of each other.
Though washed in my eye they keep their own true color.

The man is all his own hunched strength, the body’s
Self and strength, that bears, like weariness,
Itself upon itself, as a stone’s weight
Bears heavily on itself to be itself.
Heavy the strength that bears the body down.
And the way he feeds is like a dreamless sleep.
The dreaming of a stone is how he feeds.

The woman’s arms are plump, mottled a little
The flesh, like standing milk, and on one arm
A blue bruise, got in some household labor or other,
Flowering in the white. Her staring eye,
Like some bird’s cry called from some deepest wood,
Says nothing of what it is but what it is.
Such silence is the bird’s cry of the stone."
1621,Sylt II,Valzhyna Mort,"The wind that makes your hair grow faster
opens a child’s mouth full of strawberry and sand.
Slow and sure 
on the scales of the ocean
the child’s head outweighs the sun.

Inside of the wind— 
                                       a blister of a church,
its walls thicker than the space from wall to wall
where the wind shifts shade and light
like two rival chess pieces
or two unmatched pieces of furniture. 
Inside of the church—such a stillness
that when a feather floats down in a fist of dust
it becomes a rock by the time it hits the ground.

Organ pipes glint like a cold radiator,
contained in a case of a carved tree, its branches
tied up with a snake.
Organ pedals, golden and plump, are the tree’s only fruit.

It is all about the release of weight: 
the player crushes the pedals like grapes underneath his feet.
My body, like an inaccurate cashier, adds your weight to itself.
Your name, called into the wind,
slows the wind down.

When a body is ripe, it falls and rots from the softest spot. 

Only when a child slips and drops off a tree,
the tree suddenly learns that it is barren."
1622,Talking Blues,Calvin Forbes,"Raccoon you better be cool

Thought I saw you on Broadway
Eating King Fish’s barbecue

Some people claim raccoon you pretty
Swear raccoon tame like a kitty 

But raccoon bites you if you get too close

I saw raccoon on Lenox Avenue
Stealing milk from a baby 

Thought I saw a black cat on the corner
But it was nothing but old raccoon

Raccoon let me school you 

Raccoon you know you too country
You better leave the city

Raccoon they got rats in New York City
Big as you and just as ornery 

Nobody in Harlem studying you raccoon
So you better go about your business

Raccoon you better get wise
Look what playing possum got the possum"
1623,That Evening At Dinner,David Ferry,"By the last few times we saw her it was clear
That things were different. When you tried to help her   
Get out of the car or get from the car to the door
Or across the apartment house hall to the elevator   
There was a new sense of heaviness   
Or of inertia in the body. It wasn’t   
That she was less willing to be helped to walk
But that the walking itself had become less willing.   
Maybe the stupid demogorgon blind   
Recalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws   
Of mind and spirit, was getting its own back now,
Or maybe a new and subtle, alien,   
Intelligence of body was obedient now   
To other laws: “Weight is the measure of
The force with which a body is drawn downward
To the center of the earth”; “Inertia is   
The tendency of a body to resist   
Proceeding to its fate in any way   
Other than that determined for itself.”

That evening, at the Bromells’ apartment, after
She had been carried up through the rational structure   
By articulate stages, floor after flashing floor,
And after we helped her get across the hall,
And get across the room to a chair, somehow   
We got her seated in a chair that was placed   
A little too far away from the nearest table,   
At the edge of the abyss, and there she sat,
Exposed, her body the object of our attention—
The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg,
The thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe.

At work between herself and us there was   
A new principle of social awkwardness   
And skillfulness required of each of us.   
Our tones of voice in this easy conversation   
Were instruments of marvelous finesse,   
Measuring and maintaining with exactitude   
“The fact or condition of the difference
There was between us, both in space and time.”

Her smiling made her look as if she had
Just then tasted something delicious, the charm   
Her courtesy attributed to her friends.

This decent elegant fellow human being
Was seated in virtue, character, disability,   
Behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves,   
The windows monitored by Venetian blinds—
“These can be raised or lowered; numerous slats,   
Horizontally arranged, and parallel,
Which can be tilted so as to admit
Precisely the desired light or air.”

We were all her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne,   
And I, and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly man   
Named Duncan, utterly friendly and benign.
And of course it wasn’t whether or not the world   
Was benign but whether it looked at her too much.   
She wasn’t “painfully shy” but just the same   
I wouldn’t be surprised if there had been   
Painfulness in her shyness earlier on,
Say at dancing school. Like others, though, she had   
Survived her childhood somehow. Nor do I mean   
She was unhappy. Maybe more or less so   
Before her marriage. One had the sense of trips   
Arranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage   
Living it through, giving it order and style.   
And one had the sense of the late marriage as of   
Two bafflements inventing the sense they made   
Together. The marriage seemed, to the outside world,   
And probably was, radiant and triumphant,   
And I think that one could almost certainly say   
That during the last, heroic, phase of things,   
After his death, and after the stroke, she had   
By force of character and careful management,   
Maintained a certain degree of happiness.

The books there on the bookshelves told their stories,
Line after line, all of them evenly spaced,
And spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.
In one of the books Dr. Johnson told the story:   
“In the scale of being, wherever it begins,   
Or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep;   
Infinite vacuities...For surely,
Nothing can so disturb the passions, or   
Perplex the intellects of man so much,   
As the disruption of this union with   
Visible nature, separation from all
That has delighted or engaged him, a change
Not only of the place but of the manner   
Of his being, an entrance into a state
Not simply which he knows not, but perhaps   
A state he has not faculties to know.”

The dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds,   
And yellows, produce of the season due,
And fish from the nearby sea; and there were also   
Ashes to be eaten, and dirt to drink."
1624,What It Does,David Ferry,"The sea bit,
As they said it would,
And the hill slid,
As they said it would,
And the poor dead
Nodded agog
The poor head.

O topmost lofty
Tower of Troy,
The poem apparently
Speaks with joy
Of terrible things.
Where is the pleasure
The poetry brings?

Tell if you can,
What does it make?
A city of man
That will not shake,
Or if it shake,
Shake with the splendor
Of the poem’s pleasure."
1625,When I Was In Love and Out of All Else,Liz Waldner,"“It must be awful,” she said to the dog locked in it
as she left the kitchen that wasn’t hers, closing its door,
to head up the stairs with every good thing she could find
to eat in her arms

                            (to eat in her arms—O Katherine!)

                                          “not to have any arms.”"
1626,More Lies,Karin Gottshall,"Sometimes I say I’m going to meet my sister at the café—
even though I have no sister—just because it’s such
a beautiful thing to say. I’ve always thought so, ever since

I read a novel in which two sisters were constantly meeting
in cafés. Today, for example, I walked alone
on the wet sidewalk, wearing my rain boots, expecting

someone might ask where I was headed. I bought
a steno pad and a watch battery, the store windows
fogged up. Rain in April is a kind of promise, and it costs

nothing. I carried a bag of books to the café and ordered
tea. I like a place that’s lit by lamps. I like a place
where you can hear people talk about small things,

like the difference between azure and cerulean,
and the price of tulips. It’s going down. I watched
someone who could be my sister walk in, shaking the rain

from her hair. I thought, even now florists are filling
their coolers with tulips, five dollars a bundle. All over
the city there are sisters. Any one of them could be mine."
1627,Across the Bay,Donald Davie,"﻿A queer thing about those waters: there are no
Birds there, or hardly any.
I did not miss them, I do not remember
Missing them, or thinking it uncanny.
 
The beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone,
A quarry outraged by hulls.
We took pleasure in that: the emptiness, the hardness
Of the light, the silence, and the water’s stillness.
 
But this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes.
This hurt, and goes on hurting:
The venomous soft jelly, the undersides.
We could stand the world if it were hard all over."
1628,All at Once,Ed Roberson,"﻿Trees have whole streets
                                           of when they were planted
 plaqued with when the city is
                                               to inherit them dead
 of age almost all at once as if
                                             a natural bombing.
  
  
 People see a bill not figured in,
                                                       a blood red
 collection come
                    like fall’s leaf    due without fail
 an unseen cost of the design:
                                pale bud and yellow blossom—
  
  
 though seeming little to do this time
                                        with tense spring
 in the window
                                 of dead and dying trees’ terms up,
 with expecting a life by life replacement—
                      not this plague of life’s time
  
  
 as a season across the city.
                                              By trial we do, but don’t
 know how death counts the rings
                                                    from trees to clocks,
 species to singled soul
                                           at its hour. or on history’s days we all die at once."
1629,As at the Far Edge of Circling,Ed Roberson,"﻿       As at the far edge of circling the country,
facing suddenly the other ocean,
 the boundless edge of what I had wanted
 to know, I stepped
       into my answers’ shadow ocean,
  
 the tightening curl of the corners
 of outdated old paperbacks,    breakers,
 a crumble surf of tiny dry triangles around
        my ankles sinking in my stand
  
 taken      that the horizon written
 by the spin of my compass is          that this is
 is not enough         a point to turn around on,
  
        is like a skin      that falls short of edge
 as a rug,     that covers a no longer
 natural spot, no longer existent
 to live on from,    the map of my person
         come to the end of,       but not done.
  
         That country crossed was what I could imagine,
 and that little spit of answer is the shadow—
 not the ocean which casts it—      that I step next
 into       to be cleansed of question.
  
       But not of seeking      …it as
 if simplified for the seeking,
        come to its end at this body."
1630,In California,Donald Davie,"﻿Chemicals ripen the citrus;
There are rattlesnakes in the mountains,
 And on the shoreline
 Hygiene, inhuman caution.
  
 Beef in cellophane
 Tall as giraffes,
 The orange-rancher’s daughters
 Crop their own groves, mistrustful.
  
 Perpetual summer seems
 Precarious on the littoral. We drive
 Inland to prove
 The risk we sense. At once
  
 Winter claps-to like a shutter
 High over the Ojai valley, and discloses
 A double crisis,
 Winter and Drought.
  
 Ranges on mountain-ranges,
 Empty, unwatered, crumbling,
 Hot colours come at the eye.
 It is too cold
  
 For picnics at the trestle-tables. Claypit
 Yellow burns on the distance.
 The phantom walks
 Everywhere, of intolerable heat.
  
 At Ventucopa, elevation
 Two-eight-nine-six, the water hydrant frozen,
 Deserted or broken settlements,
 Gasoline stations closed and boarded.
  
 By nightfall, to the snows;
 And over the mile on tilted
 Mile of the mountain park
 The bright cars hazarded."
1631,A Low Bank of Cloud,Ed Roberson,"﻿But for a low bank of cloud,
         clear morning,    empty sky.
  
 The bright band of light beneath  the cloud’s gray
        I thought at first was open distance,    but it’s ice
  
 that by extension raised the lake above the lip of blue lake
        and spilled it farther out than that horizon
  
 along the sky
        and floods the clouds.
  
  
       Seeing the distant level further
 unfurl into the sky says not to trust
  
       blue line as terminus
 when a meniscus of ice
  
        can ride up that wall of the skyline,
 a measure of illusion how close
  
        the eye can be to filled
 with seeing,        to widen instead the tube of that measure
  
  
 of sight we are given.        There is the larger
         lake the wider look we open
  
 eyes to see. That glance of the lip
         put in a bigger cylinder falls away,
  
 but how much deeper the spring
        to fill the cup.
  
 As if the surface we are seeing
         drops          the more seeing is added,
  
  
        while we feel the stories well as our height
 from which to see.         And watch the dawns coming.
  
 …I seem to be emptying
 of time        the more time I put in,
  
        and see like a man with weathered eyes enough
 to face to face up   to the sight’s field expanded
  
        to insight.    To the dark the lake can turn
 and curl up like a map for poems to have
  
  
 these likenesses to graph,
         then come un-scrolled from semblance back
  
 to just this lake.        Water
        cities are led to        layout
  
 beside.      But never in stillness;
        always the restoration to change,
  
 from ice, from cloud, turning to clear
         liquid—as is most of our body
  
  
         water—       thinned sheet, layer
 that if written        on or with,         a bearing
  
 a name chiseled on water
        disappears."
1632,No Epitaph,Donald Davie,"﻿No moss nor mottle stains
My parents’ unmarked grave;
 My word on them remains
 Stouter than stone, you told me.
  
 “Martyred to words”, you have thought,
 Should be your epitaph;
 At other times you fought
 My self-reproaches down.
  
 Though bitterly once or twice
 You have reproached me with how
 Everything ended in words,
 We both know better now:
  
 You understand, I shall not
 If I survive you care
 To raise a headstone for
 You I have carved on air."
1633,The Nonconformist,Donald Davie,"X, whom society’s most mild command,
For instance evening dress, infuriates,
 In art is seen confusingly to stand
 For disciplined conformity, with Yeats.
  
 Taxed to explain what this resentment is
 He feels for small proprieties, it comes,
 He likes to think, from old enormities
 And keeps the faith with famous martyrdoms.
  
 Yet it is likely, if indeed the crimes
 His fathers suffered rankle in his blood,
 That he find least excusable the times
 When they acceded, not when they withstood.
  
 How else explain this bloody-minded bent
 To kick against the prickings of the norm;
 When to conform is easy, to dissent;
 And when it is most difficult, conform?"
1634,Our Lady of Perpetual Help﻿,April Lindner,"The burnt church up the street yawns to the sky,
its empty windows edged in soot, its portals
boarded up and slathered with graffiti,
oily layers, urgent but illegible.
All that can be plundered has been, all
but the carapace—the hollow bell tower,
the fieldstone box that once served as a nave.
The tidy row of homes that line this block
have tended lawns and scalloped bathtub shrines.
Each front porch holds a chair where no one sits.
Those who live here triple lock their doors
day and night. Some mornings they step out
to find a smoking car stripped to its skeleton
abandoned at the curb. Most afternoons
the street is still but for a mourning dove
and gangs of pigeons picking through the grass.
Our Lady of Perpetual Help is gray,
a dead incisor in a wary smile.
A crevice in her wall allows a glimpse
into the chancel, where a sodden mattress
and dirty blanket indicate that someone
finds this place a sanctuary still,
takes his rest here, held and held apart
from passers by, their cruelties and their kindnesses,
watched over by the night’s blind congregation,
by the blank eyes of a concrete saint.﻿"
1635,Rodez,Donald Davie,"﻿Northward I came, and knocked in the coated wall
At the door of a low inn scaled like a urinal
 With greenish tiles. The door gave, and I came
  
 Home to the stone north, every wynd and snicket
 Known to me wherever the flattened cat
 Squirmed home to a hole between housewall and paving.
  
 Known! And in the turns of it, no welcome,
 No flattery of the beckoned lighted eye
 From a Rose of the rose-brick alleys of Toulouse.
  
 Those more than tinsel garlands, more than masks,
 Unfading wreaths of ancient summers, I
 Sternly cast off. A stern eye is the graceless
  
 Bulk and bruise that at the steep uphill
 Confronts me with its drained-of-colour sandstone
 Implacably. The Church. It is Good Friday.
  
 Goodbye to the Middle Ages! Although some
 Think that I enter them, those centuries
 Of monkish superstition, here I leave them
  
 With their true garlands, and their honest masks,
 Every fresh flower cast on the porch and trodden,
 Raked by the wind at the Church door on this Friday.
  
 Goodbye to all the centuries. There is
 No home in them, much as the dip and turn
 Of an honest alley charmingly deceive us.
  
 And not yet quite goodbye. Instead almost
 Welcome, I said. Bleak equal centuries
 Crowded the porch to be deflowered, crowned."
1636,Samuel Beckett's Dublin,Donald Davie,"﻿When it is cold it stinks, and not till then.
The seasonable or more rabid heats
 Of love and summer in some other cities
 Unseal the all too human: not in his.
 When it is cold it stinks, but not before;
  
 Smells to high heaven then most creaturely
 When it is cold. It stinks, but not before
 His freezing eye has done its best to maim,
 To amputate limbs, livelihood and name,
 Abstracting life beyond all likelihood.
  
 When it is cold it stinks, and not till then
 Can it be fragrant. On canal and street,
 Colder and colder, Murphy to Molloy,
 The weather hardens round the Idiot Boy,
 The gleeful hero of the long retreat.
  
 When he is cold he stinks, but not before,
 This living corpse. The existential weather
 Smells out in these abortive minims, men
 Who barely living therefore altogether
 Live till they die; and sweetly smell till then."
1637,A Slim Volume Taken Into the Provinces,Ed Roberson,"﻿I have to leave early in the dark
and hungry to avoid
 crossing the snow as the noon
  
 burns the crust
 into an un-servable lake
 slush instead of the crisp bridge
  
 that would be in order
 to get me over the ridge
  
 My journal is already laundered clean
 of my words      and my instructions
 have dissolved
  
 into a white mash       a washed bone
 ball         rolled into itself
 of all I have in the world       in my pocket
  
  
 The ink is thin the paper is poor
 my eyes balance on the pale
 words around which a stream
  
 flows     almost erasing
 the way across
 the idea
  
 Shadows         the black flowers
 of the light self
 -sowing through the trees
  
 dark gardens        of midnight
 for the gray-white morning
 hour        of blindness
  
 in print miles before I am
 to arrive        here
  
 To approach the waiting milestone
 dims whatever else of its lantern
 ‘til only the placed light there is on me.
  
 In this light       barely      but used to it
 I can make out the staggered columns of my account
 as if back through weren’t the real distance:
  
 the thin chest flag pinned on by each ridge
 the titled introduction taking your coat each storm.
  
  
 My letters and ribbons have been the natural—
 strengths on their way to the more—
 natural weaknesses—         and loss.        yet—
  
 I wonder where I thought I was going—
 to ’ve done what you must pass
 examinations for before I took any."
1638,A Spring Song,Donald Davie,"“stooped to truth and moralized his song”﻿

Spring pricks a little. I get out the maps.
Time to demoralize my song, high time.
 Vernal a little. Primavera. First
 Green, first truth and last.
 High time, high time.
  
 A high old time we had of it last summer?
 I overstate. But getting out the maps…
 Look! Up the valley of the Brenne,
 Louise de la Vallière… Syntax collapses.
 High time for that, high time.
  
 To Château-Renault, the tannery town whose marquis
 Rooke and James Butler whipped in Vigo Bay
 Or so the song says, an amoral song
 Like Ronsard’s where we go today
 Perhaps, perhaps tomorrow.
  
 Tomorrow and tomorrow and… Get well!
 Philip’s black-sailed familiar, avaunt
 Or some word as ridiculous, the whole
 Diction kit begins to fall apart.
 High time it did, high time.
  
 High time and a long time yet, my love!
 Get out that blessed map.
 Ageing, you take your glasses off to read it.
 Stooping to truth, we potter to Montoire.
 High time, my love. High time and a long time yet."
1639,truth,Gwendolyn Brooks,"And if sun comes
How shall we greet him?
Shall we not dread him,
Shall we not fear him
After so lengthy a
Session with shade?

Though we have wept for him,
Though we have prayed
All through the night-years—
What if we wake one shimmering morning to
Hear the fierce hammering
Of his firm knuckles
Hard on the door?

Shall we not shudder?—
Shall we not flee
Into the shelter, the dear thick shelter
Of the familiar
Propitious haze?

Sweet is it, sweet is it
To sleep in the coolness
Of snug unawareness.

The dark hangs heavily
Over the eyes."
1640,Written by Himself,Gregory Pardlo,"I was born in minutes in a roadside kitchen a skillet
whispering my name. I was born to rainwater and lye;
I was born across the river where I
was borrowed with clothespins, a harrow tooth,
broadsides sewn in my shoes. I returned, though
it please you, through no fault of my own,
pockets filled with coffee grounds and eggshells.
I was born still and superstitious; I bore an unexpected burden.
I gave birth, I gave blessing, I gave rise to suspicion.
I was born abandoned outdoors in the heat-shaped air,
air drifting like spirits and old windows.
I was born a fraction and a cipher and a ledger entry;
I was an index of first lines when I was born.
I was born waist-deep stubborn in the water crying
                              ain’t I a woman and a brother I was born
to this hall of mirrors, this horror story I was
born with a prologue of references, pursued
by mosquitoes and thieves, I was born passing
off the problem of the twentieth century: I was born.
I read minds before I could read fishes and loaves;
I walked a piece of the way alone before I was born."
1641,May You Always be the Darling of Fortune,Jane Miller,"March 10th and the snow flees like eloping brides
into rain. The imperceptible change begins
out of an old rage and glistens, chaste, with its new
craving, spring. May your desire always overcome
 
your need; your story that you have to tell,
enchanting, mutable, may it fill the world
you believe: a sunny view, flowers lunging
from the sill, the quilt, the chair, all things
 
fill with you and empty and fill. And hurry, because
now as I tire of my studied abandon, counting
the days, I’m sad. Yet I trust your absence, in everything
wholly evident: the rain in the white basin, and I
 
vigilant."
1642,The Acts of Youth,John Wieners,"And with great fear I inhabit the middle of the night
What wrecks of the mind await me, what drugs
to dull the senses, what little I have left,
what more can be taken away?

The fear of travelling, of the future without hope
or buoy. I must get away from this place and see
that there is no fear without me: that it is within
unless it be some sudden act or calamity

to land me in the hospital, a total wreck, without
memory again; or worse still, behind bars. If
I could just get out of the country. Some place
where one can eat the lotus in peace.

For in this country it is terror, poverty awaits; or
am I a marked man, my life to be a lesson
or experience to those young who would trod
the same path, without God

unless he be one of justice, to wreak vengeance
on the acts committed while young under un-
due influence or circumstance. Oh I have
always seen my life as drama, patterned

after those who met with disaster or doom.
Is my mind being taken away me.
I have been over the abyss before. What
is that ringing in my ears that tells me

all is nigh, is naught but the roaring of the winter wind.
Woe to those homeless who are out on this night.
Woe to those crimes committed from which we
can walk away unharmed.

So I turn on the light
And smoke rings rise in the air.
Do not think of the future; there is none.
But the formula all great art is made of.

Pain and suffering. Give me the strength
to bear it, to enter those places where the
great animals are caged. And we can live
at peace by their side. A bride to the burden

that no god imposes but knows we have the means
to sustain its force unto the end of our days.
For that is what we are made for; for that
we are created. Until the dark hours are done.

And we rise again in the dawn.
Infinite particles of the divine sun, now
worshipped in the pitches of the night."
1643,One Day,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"Love Song for the Newly Divorced

One day, you will awake from your covering
and that heart of yours will be totally mended,
and there will be no more burning within.
The owl, calling in the setting of the sun
and the deer path, all erased.
And there will be no more need for love
or lovers or fears of losing lovers
and there will be no more burning timbers
with which to light a new fire,
and there will be no more husbands or people
related to husbands, and there will be no more
tears or reason to shed your tears.
You will be as mended as the bridge
the working crew has just reopened.
The thick air will be vanquished with the tide
and the river that was corrupted by lies
will be cleansed and totally free.
And the rooster will call in the setting sun
and the sun will beckon homeward,
hiding behind your one tree that was not felled."
1644,Uniforms,Barbara Schmitz,"It is very hot—92 today—to be wearing
a stocking cap, but the adolescent swaggering
through the grocery store automatic door
doesn’t seem to mind; does not even appear
to be perspiring. The tugged-down hat
is part of his carefully orchestrated outfit:
bagging pants, screaming t-shirt, high-topped
shoes. The young woman who yells to her friends
from an open pickup window is attired
for summer season in strapless stretch
tube top, slipping down toward bountiful
cleavage valley. She tugs it up in front
as she races toward the two who have
just passed a cigarette between them
like a baton on a relay team. Her white
chest gleams like burnished treasure
as they giggle loudly there in the corner
and I glance down to see what costume
I have selected to present myself to
the world today. I smile; it’s my sky blue
shirt with large deliberately faded Peace sign,
smack dab in the middle, plus grey suede
Birkenstocks—a message that “I lived through
the sixties and am so proud.” None of the
young look my way. I round the corner and
walk into Evening descending.﻿"
1645,The Atrophy of Private LIfe,Jennifer Moxley,"In the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word “money,” but you, assuming no one wants you anymore, mishear the message as “meaning.” Arousal follows. The lives of the rich are so fabulous! The destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands, as on their swollen notion that we are always watching. There is nothing behind the mask. Nothing suffocating under its pressure, no human essence trying to get out.


     Awareness, always awareness. Don’t you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie? The private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior. It is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line. Nobody, least of all the future, cares about the outcome of this quest.


      It is easy to lose, through meddling or neglect, an entire aspect of existence. And sometimes, to cultivate a single new thought, you need not only silence but an entirely new life."
1646,Aubade﻿,Tom Sleigh,"Lathe of the ocean. Perpetual
Motion machine of the waves. Everything still
Being turned and shaped to a shape nobody
Foresees: Ten years ago, was it, when we
 
Walked that shore, too earnest and sheepish
To hold hands? The wind cutting through our clothes
Cleansed and burned, the chill off the Atlantic
An ache we courted in our dumbstruck talk:
 
Callow, expectant, what wouldn’t love give?
Cavalcanti’s ray from Mars, Dante’s wheel that moves
The planets and the stars, how nervous
We were, awkward and shivering: “Like this,
 
Do you like it like this?” Up all night,
Then waking to the smell of flannel and sweat,
We lay grateful, winded, goosefleshed in the chill,
Our own atmosphere rich and breathable:
 
We drank round the clock, embracing extremes,
Too hurried and heartsore to think of time…
Out fishing after midnight, we watched schools of squid
Slide and shimmer, tentacles tight-wrapped
 
Around our gig’s hooks: Yanked from the water,
They spouted jets of ink, then pulsed and quivered
And faded to dead-white, their eyes, resigned and sober,
Opening wider and wider…Ten years more,
 
And will either of us remember
That ink sticky on our hands, the moon-glare
Rippling as we knelt underneath the pier
And scrubbed and scrubbed our hands in the dark water?

1647,The Bridge,Lisa Jarnot,"That there are things that can never be the same about
my face, the houses, or the sand, that I was born under the
sign of the sheep, that like Abraham Lincoln I am serious
but also lacking in courage,
 
That from this yard I have been composing a great speech,
that I write about myself, that it’s good to be a poet, that I look
like the drawing of a house that was pencilled by a child,
that curiously, I miss him and my mind is not upon the Pleaides,
that I love the ocean and its foam against the sky,
 
That I am sneezing like a lion in this garden that he knows
the lilies of his Nile, distant image, breakfast, a flock of birds
and sparrows from the sky,
 
That I am not the husband of Cassiopeia, that I am not
the southern fish, that I am not the last poet of civilization,
that if I want to go out for a walk and then to find myself
beneath a bank of trees, weary, that this is the life that I had,
 
That curiously I miss the sound of the rain pounding
on the roof and also all of Oakland, that I miss the sounds of
sparrows dropping from the sky, that there are sparks behind
my eyes, on the radio, and the distant sound of sand blasters,
and breakfast, and every second of it, geometric, smoke
from the chimney of the trees where I was small,
 
That in January, I met him in a bar, we went
home together, there was a lemon tree in the back yard,
and a coffee house where we stood outside and kissed,
 
That I have never been there, curiously, and that it never was
the same, the whole of the island, or the paintings of the stars,
fatherly, tied to sparrows as they drop down from the sky,
 
O rattling frame where I am, I am where there are still
these assignments in the night, to remember the texture
of the leaves on the locust trees in August, under the
moonlight, rounded, through a window in the hills,
 
That if I stay beneath the pole star in this harmony of
crickets that will sing, the bird sound on the screen,
the wide eyes of the owl form of him still in the dark,
blue, green, with shards of the Pacific,
 
That I do not know the dreams from which I have come,
sent into the world without the blessing of a kiss, behind the
willow trees, beside the darkened pansies on the deck beside
the ships, rocking, I have written this, across the back of the
sky, wearing a small and yellow shirt, near the reptile house,
mammalian, no bigger than the herd,
 
That I wrote the history of the war waged between the
Peloponnesians and the south, that I like to run through
shopping malls, that I’ve also learned to draw, having been
driven here, like the rain is driven into things, into the
ground, beside the broken barns, by the railroad tracks,
beside the sea, I, Thucydides, having written this, having
grown up near the ocean."
1648,Calling Him Back from Layoff,Bob Hicok,"I called a man today. After he said
hello and I said hello came a pause
during which it would have been
 
confusing to say hello again so I said
how are you doing and guess what, he said
fine and wondered aloud how I was
 
and it turns out I’m OK. He
was on the couch watching cars
painted with ads for Budweiser follow cars
 
painted with ads for Tide around an oval
that’s a metaphor for life because
most of us run out of gas and settle
 
for getting drunk in the stands
and shouting at someone in a t-shirt
we want kraut on our dog. I said
 
he could have his job back and during
the pause that followed his whiskers
scrubbed the mouthpiece clean
 
and his breath passed in and out
in the tidal fashion popular
with mammals until he broke through
 
with the words how soon thank you
 ohmyGod which crossed his lips and drove
through the wires on the backs of ions
 
as one long word as one hard prayer
of relief meant to be heard
by the sky. When he began to cry I tried
 
with the shape of my silence to say
I understood but each confession
of fear and poverty was more awkward
 
than what you learn in the shower.
After he hung up I went outside and sat
with one hand in the bower of the other
 
and thought if I turn my head to the left
it changes the song of the oriole
and if I give a job to one stomach other
 
forks are naked and if tonight a steak
sizzles in his kitchen do the seven
other people staring at their phones
 
hear?"
1649,Intelligence﻿,Tom Sleigh,"Wiretaps and tapes, concealed
bugs and mikes,
                           intercepted letters
full of passionate declarations, contradictory
intelligence—
                           how attached he’d grown
to the subject’s documents, revising and rearranging
the influx of intelligence
with a sentiment, he acknowledged, almost
                           like love: he felt
the cool gray eyes of his superiors
trained on him, rebuking him
                           for swerving, for letting
himself go—such tender obsession
occasioned by the file!
                           Not quite the professional style
he or the Agency expected…
 
But such official loyalties
                           seemed mere protocol to this!—
what was wrong with him,
                           he wondered, that he construed
the documents to make the subject
seem a hero,
                           a bastard whose sole patrimony
was a pair of shoes and a rusted sword
left by an unknown father beneath a stone?
 
And yet his exploits in the tabloids,
the headlines screaming,
 
SCOURGE OF MONSTERS STRIKES AGAIN!
HERO FOUNDS REPUBLIC
 
                           were these heroic
different in kind from the rumors,
unverified,
                           of a rape, a murder?
 
—But to have met undisguised the devouring monster!
To have escaped the twisting tunnels of the maze…
 
On balance, for such a life,
                           the hero’s reputation wasn’t bad:
think of the opportunities for evil
                           a man of such qualities must have had!
How well he knew him—an essential innocence
that followed impulse, blind
to protocol, not noticeably more kind
                           than he was cruel.
But to stamp Case Closed and cease
                           gathering intelligence,
to give the hero up, almost, he admitted,
like a lover…:
                           such limits the hero
unknowingly transgressed!
And the Agency, cold-blooded where
                           limits were concerned (“mere protocol”?—
more like a second backbone!), committed
                           to keeping order, could not afford
such sentiments—the Chief of Security
felt an awful pang: that the work of intelligence
                           should lead to this…
 
He leaned back in his chair and sighed:
                           a forged genealogy certifying
that the hero’s father was a king; a mutual
assistance pact
                           to aid in taking back the usurped crown:
he could see them now, the wind
blowing lightly, the two of them sweating
as they climbed the cliff, discussing
                           the terms, exchanging information,
intelligence—
                           how would his own face look
staring down across the sea
                           as he gestured earnestly toward
some island, saying,
                           “According to our sources,
the tax revenues…”
                           And then, edging
the hero closer to the cliff, pointing
                           out the harbor, he’d push.

1650,The Last Word﻿,Tom Sleigh,"for Lem ﻿

As if your half-witted tongue
Spoke with an eloquence
Death bestows, I heard your voice
Muffled through the dark
Layers of cemetery loam:
 
“They found me black-suited
In the shuttered half-dark, my eyes
Dug like claws into the clouds’
Soft feather-turnings. What kept me
Separate the broiling sun
 
Of intellect now shone on fiercely:
In the sheep-pens stinking
Of dung and lanolin,
I buried my face in the ewe’s
Swollen side and listened
 
For the lamb the way
The night sky listens
To the synapse-fire
Of meteors, the fibrillating
Heartbeat of the stars.
 
I heard the cells crackle
Into being, the embryonic
Brain begin to burn:
Hunger. Thirst. Beneath my ear
My own disastrous birthing,
 
The umbilicus strangling
Like a whip around my neck,
Shoved through the momentary
Breach memory tore open—
Dying revealed to me my birth,
 
How half my brain went dark,
One side of a universe
Pinched out like a candle:
Just smart enough to sense
My difference, yet not know why—
 
Even my death was the thrust
Of a bewildering punchline: On Thanksgiving
Morning mouthwatering
Pain shoved like a spit
From my bowels to my brain.”
﻿"
1651,The Wound﻿,Tom Sleigh,"When I woke the darkness was so thick,
So palpable and black that my eyes
Seemed blind as stone staring into stone.
 
The blade that I had dreamed, efficient and quick
As it cut into my thigh, cleaning a gangrened
Wound infected to the bone, seemed poised
 
Above my throat: Close-grained, impenetrable,
The blackness rose before me like a wall.
And then off in the next room, nervous, light,
 
A soft padding as of an animal
Raced like my heartbeat in my temples
Round and round, trapped, stealthily desperate
 
As if hunting its own track, terrified
And captivated by its own odor.
Skin cool in the night air, eyes drilling
 
Through the dark, who I was before I
Slept had burned off like a vapor
So that amnesiac and pure, witnessing
 
My terror that I no longer recognized
As my own, my mind floated beyond me
To confront that frantic, closing footfall
 
As Jacob dreaming met his dark angel—
Though in my wrestling nothing blessed me
Or promised any blessing; but was a mask whose eyes
 
Were all black pupil, blind as molten tar.
I strained to see what paced there, my eyes burning
Through the dark until a pair of eyes blazed
 
Back across the blackness, an insistent, glazed
Staring that shimmered and disappeared.
The shining blade plunged at my throat, my mind
 
Stretched and twisted, its wires tightening
And turning as the creature lunged back and forth
And with a deep-throated yowling, thrashing
 
And thrashing to fight clear of its own circling,
Cleanly leapt away. I reached for the knife
But gripped only air, my eyes pressing
 
Deeper and deeper into the night’s black stone,
Cutting the way the knife had cut into my wound,
Probing for the white shining of the bone:
 
What had I become? What darkness had my dream
Led me down into? Too frightened even
To move, I lay bound and sweating in
 
The sheets, the moon a warning-bell beating
On the glass, its light carving out the curtains
Like the shadow of a wing across the windowpane.
﻿"
1652,Animalistic Hymn,Edith Södergran,"The red sun rises
without intent
and shines the same on all of us.
We play like children under the sun.
One day, our ashes will scatter—
                                           it doesn’t matter when.
Now the sun finds our innermost hearts,
                                           fills us with oblivion
intense as the forest, winter and sea."
1653,The Bend,Claude Esteban,"Around the bend of a phrase
you return, it’s dawn in a book, it’s
a garden, one can
see everything, the dew, a moth
on a leaf and it’s you
who rises suddenly amid the pages
and the book grows more lovely
because it’s you
and you’ve not grown old, you walk
slowly to the door."
1654,A blind man was riding an unheated train,Arseny Tarkovsky,"A blind man was riding an unheated train,
From Bryansk he was traveling home with his fate.

Fate whispered to him so the whole car could hear:
And why should you care about blindness and war?

It’s good, she was saying, you’re sightless and poor.
If you were not blind, you’d never survive.

The Germans won’t kill you, you’re nothing to them.
Allow me to lift that bag on your shoulder—

The one with the holes, the empty torn one.
Let me just raise your eyelids wide open.

The blind man was traveling home with his fate,
Now thankful for blindness. Happy about it."
1655,The Burning Kite,Ouyang Jianghe,"What a thing it would be, if we all could fly.
But to rise on air does not make you a bird.

I’m sick of the hiss of champagne bubbles.
It’s spring, and everyone’s got something to puke.

The things we puke: flights of stairs,
a skyscraper soaring from the gut,

the bills blow by on the April breeze
followed by flurries of razor blades in May.

It’s true, a free life is made of words.
You can crumple it, toss it in the trash,

or fold it between the bodies of angels, attaining
a permanent address in the sky.

The postman hands you your flight of birds
persisting in the original shape of wind.

Whether they’re winging toward the scissors’ V
or printed and plastered on every wall

or bound and trussed, bamboo frames wound with wire
or sentenced to death by fire

you are, first
and always, ash.

Broken wire, a hurricane at each end.
Fire trucks scream across the earth.

But this blaze is a thing of the air.
Raise your glass higher, toss it up and away.

Few know this kind of dizzy glee:
an empty sky, a pair of burning wings."
1656,The Children,Eugénio de Andrade,"Children grow in secret. They hide themselves in the depths and darker reaches of the house to become wild cats, white birches.


One day when you’re only half-watching the herd as it straggles back in with the afternoon dust, one child, the prettiest of them all, comes close and rises up on tiptoe to whisper 
I love you
, 
I’ll be waiting for you in the hay
.


Shaking some, you go to find your shotgun; you spend what’s left of the day firing at rooks and jackdaws, uncountable at this hour, and crows."
1657,Doric,Angelos Sikelianos,"With her hair closely cropped up to the nape
Like Dorian Apollo’s, the girl lay on the narrow
Pallet, keeping her limbs stiffly frozen
Within a heavy cloud she could not escape...

Artemis emptied her quiver—every arrow
Shot through her body. And though very soon
She’d be no virgin, like cold honeycomb,
Her virgin thighs still kept her pleasure sealed...

As if to the arena, the youth came
Oiled with myrrh, and like a wrestler kneeled
To pin her down; and although he broke past

Her arms that she had thrust against his chest,
Only much later, with one cry, face to face,
Did they join lips, and out of their sweat, embrace..."
1658,Dream: The Night of December 23rd ﻿,Michael McClure,"for Jane ﻿

—ALL  HUGE LIKE GIANT FLIGHTLESS KIWIS TWICE THE
                                                                         SIZE OF OSTRICHES,
                          they turned and walked away from us
                 and you were there Jane and you were twenty-two
                        but this was the nineteen-forties,
                   in Wichita, near the edge of town, in a field
                  surrounded by a copse of cottonwoods. It was
                    getting dark and the trees around the bridge
                       almost glowed like a scene by Palmer.
           The two Giant Birds—Aepyorni—from Madagascar,
               extincted A.D. one thousand, turned and walked
           from us across the bridge. Even in the semi-darkness
                   the softness of their brown feathers made
                 curls pliant as a young mother’s hair. There
         was a sweet submission in the power of their enormous
                  legs (giant drumsticks). Their tiny heads
                  (in proportion to their bodies) were bent
          utterly submerged in their business and sweeping
         side to side as a salmon does—or as a wolf does—
             but with a Pleistocene, self-involved gentleness
                beyond our ken. My heart rose in my chest
                    (as the metaphysical poets say “with
                   purple wings of joy.”) to see them back
              in life again. We both looked, holding hands,
                     and I felt your wide-eyed drinking-in
 
of things.
                Then I turned and viewed across the darkening
             field and there was a huge flightless hunting fowl
                  (the kind that ate mammals in the Pliocene).
          He stood on one leg in the setting sun by the sparkling
               stream that cut across the meadow to the bridge.
 
            He had a hammer head and curled beak, and after my
                 initial surge of fear to see the field was dotted,
            populated, by his brethren, each standing in the setting
 
                        sun, I saw their stately nobility
 
                                                                              and again
 
the self-involvement.
 
                                   We followed the Aepyorni
 
                      across the old wooden bridge made of huge
                timbers. The bridge was dark from the shadows
                     of the poplars and the evergreens there.
               The stream was dimpled with flashing moonlight
 
                        —and I think it had a little song.
 
                                                                                  Then
 
              I found that on the bridge we were among
              a herd of black Wildebeests—Black Gnus.
           One was two feet away—turned toward me—
                looking me eye-into-eye. There was primal
                    wildness in the upstanding coarse (not
                        sleek as it really is in Africa) fur on
                the knobby, powerful-like-buffalo shoulders.
                 (Remember this is a dream.) I passed by him
           both afraid and unafraid of wildness as I had passed
     through the herd of zebras at the top of Ngorongoro Crater
        in front of the lodge, where from the cliff we could see
            a herd of elephants like ants, and the soda lake
                    looked pink because of flamingos there.
                        There is an essence in fear overcome
                and I overcame fright in passing those zebras
 
                     and this black Wildebeest.
 
                                                            Then we passed
 
                  over the heavy bridge and down a little trail
                  on the far side of the meadow, walking back
 
                  in the direction we had been.
 
                                                                   Soon we came
 
                       to a cottage of white clapboards
          behind a big white clapboard house and knocked
             on the door; it was answered by a young man
  with long hair who was from the Incredible String Band.
          He took us inside and he played an instrument
              like a guitar and he danced as he played it.
          The lyre-guitar was covered with square plastic
                buttons in rows of given sizes and shapes.
              The instrument would make any sound, play
                 any blues, make any creature sound, play
                             any melody…I wanted it
                     badly—it was a joy. My chest rose.
               I figured I’d have to, and would be glad to,
                  give twenty or thirty thousand for it…
                              Then the dream broke
              and I was standing somewhere with Joanna
                to the side of a crowd of people by a wall
                of masonry and I reached into my mouth
                  and took from my jaw (all the other
        persons vanished and I was the center of everything)
                        a piece which was eight teeth
                      fused together. I stared at them
               wondering how they could all be one piece.
                They were white…It was some new fossil.
        Down on the bone there were indentations like rivulets
                    like the flowing patterns of little rivers."
1659,Empty Space,Amrita Pritam,"There were two kingdoms only:
the first of them threw out both him and me.
The second we abandoned.

Under a bare sky
I for a long time soaked in the rain of my body,
he for a long time rotted in the rain of his.

Then like a poison he drank the fondness of the years.
He held my hand with a trembling hand.
“Come, let’s have a roof over our heads awhile.
Look, further on ahead, there
between truth and falsehood, a little empty space.”"

—they’ve come so far...the eggs are painted with colors corresponding to the days of the week you’re supposed to eat them: a different color for each opportunity. i felt dizzy, the gulf between myself and this place seemed insuperable. tears welled up in my eyes, i wanted desperately to flee, to get outside so i could breathe. i wanted to explain to Phillis, the North American who had invited me, what was happening to me. i tried, but she couldn’t understand: you have to have felt it yourself: the first time. for the first time my mind had crossed over five hundred years of development at jet speed and arrived in the future, a cold future, its display cases filled with artificial snow and artificial heat. there were a thousand things i never knew existed, a panoply of brand names and gadgets for every purpose. i felt like someone from the stone age, and realized most people on the planet never know the era they’re living in, any more than they could know the quantity of living matter in this galaxy that surrounds us, or the milky complexity of the molecules in their own brains, and what’s more they don’t know that they’ll die without ever knowing. i felt terror of that gloss, of the waxed fruit, of propaganda so refined it could dilute the existence of the strange things before my eyes, other sensations: everything wanting to be used up, immediately, licked, tasted, eaten, packaged, mastered. i knew i couldn’t stand this avalanche, this brilliant swarm, for long, these rows on rows of distant faces staring out at me from cardboard boxes. i’d seen nothing singular in the place, no unique thing i could separate out from the amorphous mass of texture and sensation. i began to move closer, imagining i walked with those who have never eaten meat or tasted cow’s milk, who have never nursed except from the teat of a goat. those who have had only wildflowers to chew when the winter hunger comes. i approached closer still, imagining i walked with the salty ones, who collect their water from the public pipe. my nose began to bleed and Phillis said it was the cold; i knew that wasn’t the problem. we were near the seafood display, i moved closer. fish have always aroused in me both horror and desire. i moved closer, like a lost child feeling her way through space toward something of hers that’s hidden. i brushed the shells with my fingertips, they were smooth and delicate, but obviously artificial, made to be used once and thrown away. at first touch they might seem real, pearly, perfect, but they’re actually plastic, and they’ve never even seen any sea."
1661,Fruit Don’t Fall Far,Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,"From Daddy sprung my inborn ribaldry.
His crudeness destined me to be the same.
A seedlet, flowered from a shitty heap,
I came, the crowning glory of his aim.

From Mother I inherited ennui,
The leg irons of the queendom I once rattled.
But I won’t let such chains imprison me.
And there is just no telling what this brat’ll...!

This marriage thing? We snub our nose at it.
What’s pearl turns piss, what’s classy breeds what’s smutty.
But like it? Lump it? Neither’s exigent.
And I’m the end result of all that fucking.

Do what you will! This world’s your oyster, Pet.
But be forewarned. The sea might drown you yet."
1662,Goats,Eugénio de Andrade,"Wherever the earth is crag and scrub, the goats are there—the black ones, girlishly skipping, leaping their little leaps from rock to rock. I’ve loved their nerve and frisk since I was small.


Once my grandfather gave me one of my own. He showed me how I could serve myself when I got hungry, from the full-feeling bags there like warmish wineskins, where I’d let my hands linger some before bringing my mouth close, so the milk wouldn’t go to waste on my face, my neck, even my naked chest, which did happen sometimes, who knows if on purpose, my mind dwelling all the while on the savory-smelling vulva
zinha
. I called her Maltesa; she was my horse; I could almost say she was my first woman."
1663,A Gray Day,Elena Shvarts,"I spoke in a hurry, in a nervous hush,
Because the time was short—
The lightning was shuddering,
Slowing down, running.

Or was that my blood,
The quiet diminishing of daily life?
It’s time for me to go forth
Into Your tiny mustard seed.

In the house of my Father, everything is fading,
In the house of the Father, all the angels are crying,
Because the anguish of a jaded, exhausted horse
Sometimes finds its way even unto them.

One gray day, I was alive on this earth,
And amid the mist of day—in triumph—
The Spirit may approach and look
So that you will see Him, without seeing.

And, so, celebrate the meager light,
Curse not the twilight.
If Christ is to visit us
It will be on such pitiful days as these."
1664,Hollywood Elegies,Bertolt Brecht,"﻿﻿1

Under the long green hair of pepper trees,
The writers and composers work the street.
Bach’s new score is crumpled in his pocket,
Dante sways his ass-cheeks to the beat.

                                     ﻿2

The city is named for the angels,
And its angels are easy to find.
They give off a lubricant odor,
Their eyes are mascara-lined;
At night you can see them inserting
Gold-plated diaphragms;
For breakfast they gather at poolside
Where screenwriters feed and swim.

                                     ﻿3

Every day, I go to earn my bread
In the exchange where lies are marketed,
Hoping my own lies will attract a bid.

                                     ﻿4

It’s Hell, it’s Heaven: the amount you earn
Determines if you play the harp or burn.

                                     ﻿5

Gold in their mountains,
Oil on their coast;
Dreaming in celluloid
Profits them most."
1665,Lament,Labid,"We wither, unlike stars;    die, unlike hills and cisterns.

 Ana shadowed my protector,    esteemed Arbad, who’s left us.

But ana do not grieve;    all sparrows exit the feast hall.

Novelties don’t excite me,    nor wyrdstaef affright me.

Men are like encampments    that soon become ruins.

They come with their kin,    leave only land behind when
        they go—

the last herdsman    rounding up the stragglers.

Man’s a shooting star:    light turned to ash.

Wealth and kin a stain    that soon wears away.

The work we do    inevitably gehrorene.

The wise grasp this;    the foolish fight it and lose.

If my wyrd holds off a while,    my fingers reach out for its stick.

 Ana can tell you stories,    bent over the more ana try to straighten.

 Ana am like a battered sword    that hasn’t gotten any less sharp.

Don’t leave me!    (The sparrow finds the exit suddenly—.)

Can your witchcraft tell us    who’ll return?

1667,Leaves Fell,Juhan Liiv,"A gust roused the waves,
leaves blew into the water,
the waves were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn.

It was good for my heart:
there my feelings were ash-gray,
the sky tin-gray,
ash-gray the autumn.

The breath of wind brought cooler air,
the waves of mourning brought separation:
autumn and autumn
befriend each other."
1668,A Letter,Amrita Pritam,"Me—a book in the attic.
Maybe some covenant or hymnal.
Or a chapter from the Kama Sutra,
or a spell for intimate afflictions.
But then it seems I am none of these.
(If I were, someone would have read me.)

Apparently at an assembly of revolutionaries
they passed a resolution,
and I am a longhand copy of it.
It has the police’s stamp on it
and was never successfully enforced.
It is preserved only for the sake of procedure.

And now only some sparrows come,
straw in their beaks,
and sit on my body
and worry about the next generation.
(How wonderful to worry about the next generation!)
Sparrows have wings on them,
but resolutions have no wings
(or resolutions have no second generation).

Sometimes I think to catch the scent—
what lies in my future?
Worry makes my binding come off.
Whenever I try to smell,
just some fumes of bird shit.
O my earth, your future!
Me—your current state."
1669,Me,Amrita Pritam,"Lots of contemporaries—
but “me” is not my contemporary.

My birth without “me”
was a blemished offering on the collection plate.
A moment of flesh, imprisoned in flesh.

And when to the tip of this tongue of flesh
some word comes, it kills itself.
If saved from killing itself,
it descends to the paper, where a murder happens.

Gunshot—
if it strikes me in Hanoi
it strikes again in Prague.

A little smoke floats up,
and my “me” dies like an eighth-month child.
Will my “me” one day be my contemporary?"
1670,memory of water,Reina María Rodríguez,"september is a month like any other and unlike any other. it seems in september everything awaited will arrive: in the calm air, in a particular scent, in the stillness of the quay. when september comes, i know i’m going to lose myself. the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so. the air comes and goes beneath my dress, pressing the warm cloth against me, pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea, that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos, thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications. the salty, sticky wall of the Malecón is covered with fish and forgotten hooks. i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky. in that moment the rest of the city can vanish, it’s just that sea and me, before all thought, all desire. then i undress and enter, knowing i’ll find something, and that the boats—which seem suspended on the horizon, seem to have slipped their limits, motionless and painted there—are also mine...when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after—though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks, shaping a sort of formless impression: something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you, but without making a human form, and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle’s spoked wheel...the bicycle moves on and i’m carried along, filled with dry branches and coral. in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together. the little house, one point amid the infinite, comes into view: already we can see the windows, like little black voids, and their curtains beating in the wind. i squeeze your waist, the bicycle moves on; even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on, rolls on against the spray. when you turn your head and see my hand, my hook snagged in a struggle of desire, the sun has turned immense in your eyes again. you make for the little house already in view, already at the edge of the curve...a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal: his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light. a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins, where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig. his body—your body—is an arc i want to tighten, to overcome, to conquer. hidden behind a tree, i can see your eyes again. the Mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. the arc tightens and closes. i throw an arm over you, a leg, a hand, a lip, hallucinations, an ear—as usual. my body moves on. the Mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. its water burns in my thighs, in the course of my dreams: the Mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the United States, it is born in Lake Itasca, passes through St. Paul, St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the Gulf of Mexico. i’m in geography class. i like this class. the world just barely fits in my head. the map hangs before me with its spokes and points. someone made that all up, just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there. all those castles and fortifications to toy with, the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality, but isn’t, because we’re not outside but inside the globe, that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency, and even far from the classroom nothing’s different: there’s just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world, always turning, imperfect and constant inside me. i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head. i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can’t measure. i also like the geography professor, whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself. he doesn’t know, he can’t imagine, that while he lectures, while he looks at me, i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river. the boy behind me won’t stop looking at me, and whatever one does the others all follow, watching from the corners of their eyes. that’s why i’m going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won’t find me, alone at my desk in the middle of the world...in the middle of the lake there’s a boat and we’re three—although the third may have already vanished for us—and i want to paddle and sit in the center. you’ve taken off your shirt: the landscape appears and disappears. when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge. you try to teach me: you take my hands—you’re behind and above me. my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat. i’m wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol. the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed. my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders. we try to steer but go nowhere. you explain the roundness of the earth; the sharpened tip of the compass needle, always precise, marking contours, lines, limits. the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape: appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances, the symmetry, forgetfulness, incarnation in other beings: animals, plants, and later, men once again. you taught me all this, but i’m not a map and i hold still. i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end: the oar descends toward the deep, it is september. we don’t move. i keep still to be different, that’s why..."
1671,"Mother, Kitchen",Ouyang Jianghe,"Where the immemorial and the instant meet, opening and distance appear.
Through the opening: a door, crack of light.
Behind the door, a kitchen.

Where the knife rises and falls, clouds gather, disperse.
A lightspeed joining of life and death, cut
in two: halves of a sun, of slowness.

Halves of a turnip.
A mother in the kitchen, a lifetime of cuts.
A cabbage cut into mountains and rivers,
a fish, cut along its leaping curves,
laid on the table
still yearning for the pond.

Summer’s tofu
cut into premonitions of snow.
A potato listens to the onion-counterpoint
of the knife, dropping petals at its strokes:
self and thing, halves of nothing
at the center of time.
Where gone and here meet, the knife rises, falls.

But this mother is not holding a knife.

What she has been given is not a knife
but a few fallen leaves.
The fish leaps over the blade from the sea
to the stars. The table is in the sky now,
the market has been crammed into the refrigerator,
and she cannot open cold time."
1672,Mozart in E-flat Major,Hsia Yü,"I turn around.
          I feel Monday’s well-shaven face lightly
          caress my left shoulder

          most cherished part
          most crucial here and now"
1673,Music,Juhan Liiv,"It must be somewhere, the original harmony,
somewhere in great nature, hidden.
Is it in the furious infinite,
in distant stars’ orbits,
is it in the sun’s scorn,
in a tiny flower, in treegossip,
in heartmusic’s mothersong
or in tears?
It must be somewhere, immortality,
somewhere the original harmony must be found:
how else could it infuse
the human soul,
that music?"
1674,from “Octonaires on the World’s Vanity and Inconstancy”,Antoine de Chandieu,"Ice glitters like it’s good.
The whole world glitters,

Fire, air, water, and earth

than earth, water, air, or fire.

It’s all echo—whatever world
keeps calling to you
in the woods, in a rock, a deep wave—
Just a lie that vanishes

as soon as it tricks you inside.
Shut up, go away, say to the world.
And it does—into the woods, a rock,
deep waves that keep calling you.

When the sky’s dark face
catches your eye again,
let memory write
of a darkness beyond this:

of searching untaught,
thinking your own thought,
light.

Wanting what you fear,
fearing your own desire:
icicles at the heart

of suffering he sings,
does the martyr begin
to suspect himself?"
1675,On the Term of Exile,Bertolt Brecht,"No need to drive a nail into the wall
To hang your hat on;
When you come in, just drop it on the chair
No guest has sat on.

Don’t worry about watering the flowers—
In fact, don’t plant them.
You will have gone back home before they bloom,
And who will want them?

If mastering the language is too hard,
Only be patient;
The telegram imploring your return
Won’t need translation.

Remember, when the ceiling sheds itself
In flakes of plaster,
The wall that keeps you out is crumbling too,
As fast or faster.

 Translated from the German by Adam Kirsch"
1676,Poem,Lucie Thésée,"Handsome, like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high, in little crystal globes.
Handsome, like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle. If tulle were life.
Handsome, like a frozen face, tear-tracked, when the sun hammers down.
Handsome. Like fire.
Handsome, like the bottomless sky, with that one proud penetrating star.

But handsome, too, like a sky that’s an arching ocean, and an earth prone as an ocean’s floor.
Handsome ocean-sky, and earth-sea floor.
            The big question is: where’s the man in a scene like this?

Handsome: the man asleep. And the night sky swarms, tropic and wide.
Handsome, in some ornamental, muggy midnight caught between cat’s paws. Sharp-nailed:
            they prick.
Handsome: the firefly swarms around you.
Handsome, like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress. Like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin.
Handsomeness a rainbow, a rainbow an arrow, an arrow in my chest.
Handsome, like shadows slow-rolling on a Japanese screen.
Handsome motion.
Handsome as life and poison.
Sun-blood handsome. Bleeding sun.

 Translated from the French by Robert Archambeau"
1677,The Portrait,Edith Södergran,"For my little ballads,
those strange, sunset-red laments,
spring paid me a gull’s egg.

I bade my lover paint my portrait
                                            on its thick shell.
He painted a new bulb in brown soil—
on the other side, a powdery mound of sand."

Nobles enjoy it on earth,      but not without end,
worldly ones.      ﻿ must fail

must travel so far      (no telling where!)
beyond this world      to a yet-unknown
place in the earth.      So must each person,
unless he is granted      God-sent grace.
            Let us call to God      again, more eager,
begging his blessing      in this bright creation:
may we be welcomed      to his warm halls,
his home on high.      There is holiest happiness,
there the king of angels      crowns the pure
with a perishless prize.      Now his praise endures
masterful and marvelous,      and his might extends
endless and ageless      over all creation.      finit.

1679,Sarabande,Lucie Thésée,"Look straight, and don’t tremble, wreckage of my hanged race:
a sarabande dancer, Japanese muslin tight on her live-wire hips
arrives with the moonlight, fast as the tam-tam drums.
She’ll take you to the grand esplanade where the gallows
tell your story, tell of your dim bronze halos
licked away by a pale man’s greed.

Leave your gallows tears behind,
the long-drawn vowels of the lost names of flowers,
the long-drawn cries of your burden of grain,
the long-drawn cries of your burden of seed-pods,
and the long-drawn cries of the seed-pods cut and hung.
Shipwreck of my race, twisted in the wind-rush,
fall from your broken gallows, wrack, wreck, and driftwood,
my bloodied race.
My bloodied race fearful, scab-dried, sterile, paralyzed,
the low-caste wallflowers trembling at a ball for mice—
no. Leave your gallows, there, those: the gallows of time-gone-by.
Lift your chestnut-dark and heavy limbs, up from out the shipwreck’s carnage,
and up through those long blue-green rolling waves.
Sing the wind’s songs, and collect what’s needed, drop by shivering drop,
in this, your Lenten fasting, in this, your sorcerer’s midnight, under this, the whip.
Leave the gallows, the sap of its cut-wood spits on your skin.
You’d hang there, yourself in effigy? No. Live sap runs in the driftwood branch.
You’ll play, gentle, a light wind in the shimmering green of a dancer’s beaded muslin skirt,
and your broken music will move in the foolish grass that still believes in death—
leave your gallows-bones there, in the fool’s green shroud . . .
Scratch with the rusted nail of melody, because you live, wreckage of my race,
the sky will not forget you, nor the graveyard’s earth, fertile and walled.
Your blood still dances, a wreckage of joy, joy soured,
obstinate joy, wild and unbroken,
shipwreck of my race, sarabande."
1680,"Someone, and no matter",Claude Esteban,"Someone, and no matter who, inhabits my head like it’s an empty house, he enters, he leaves, he bangs each door behind him, powerless I put up with this ruckus. Someone, and maybe it’s me, palms my most private thoughts, he crumples them, returns them to dust. Someone, and it’s much later now, slowly walks across the room and, not seeing me, stops to contemplate the havoc. Someone, and no matter where, collects the pieces of my shadow."
1681,Song of the Dwarf,Rainer Maria Rilke,"Maybe my soul is straight and good,
but she’s got to lug my heart, my blood,
which all hurts because it’s crooked;
its weight sends her staggering.
She has no bed, she has no home,
she merely hangs on my sharp bones,
flapping her terrible wings.

And my hands are completely shot,
shriveled, worn: here, take a look
at how they clammily, clumsily hop
like rain-crazed toads.
As for all the other stuff,
it’s all used up and sad and old—
why doesn’t God haul me out to the muck
and let me drop.

Is it because of my mug
with its frowning mouth?
So often I would itch
to be luminous and free of fog
but nothing would approach
except big dogs.
And the dogs got zilch."
1682,To Be Elsewhere,Hsia Yü,"We met in a coastal village
spent a lovely night without leaving an address
going separate ways. Three years later
we meet again by coincidence.
The whole
three years spun a novel
we abandoned:
They fail to recognize themselves
as though meeting in another story
for an encounter.
One asks: Who are you, so cold and weary
The other says: I only know a thread is loose on my sweater
            The more you pull it, the more it lengthens
            until I completely vanish."
1683,To Poems,Arseny Tarkovsky,"My poems: fledglings, heirs,
Plaintiffs and executors,
The silent ones, the loud,
The humble and the proud.

As soon as the shovel of time
Threw me onto the potter’s wheel—
Myself without kith or kin—
I grew beneath the hand, a miracle.

Something stretched out my long neck
And hollowed round my soul
And marked on my back
Legends of flowers and leaves.

I stoked the birch in the fire
As Daniel commanded
And blessed my red temper
Until I spoke as a prophet.

I had long been the earth—
Arid, ochre, forlorn since birth—
But you fell on my chest by chance
From beaks of birds, from eyes of grass."
1684,The Unfaithful Housewife,Federico García Lorca,"For Mary Peace﻿

Then I led her to the river
certain she was still a virgin
though she had a husband.
The fourth Friday in July,
as good as on a promise.
The street lights were vanishing
and the crickets flaring up.
Last bend out of town
I brushed her sleepy breasts.
They blossomed of a sudden
like the tips of hyacinths
and the starch of her petticoat
bustled in my ear like silk
slit by a dozen blades.
The pines, minus their halo
of silver, grew huger
and the horizon of dogs
howled a long way from the river.

Past the blackberry bushes,
the rushes and whitethorn,
beneath her thatch of hair,
I made a dip in the sand.
I took off my neckerchief.
She unstrapped her dress.
Me my gun and holster,
she her layers of slips...
Not tuberose, not shell,
has skin as half as smooth
nor does mirror glass
have half the shimmer.
Her hips flitted from me
like a pair of startled tench:
the one full of fire,
the other full of cold.
That night I might
as well have ridden
the pick of the roads
on a mother-of-pearl mare
without bridle or stirrups.
Gentleman that I am,
I won’t say back the scraps
she whispered to me.
It dawned out there
to leave my lip bitten.
Filthy with soil and kisses,
I led her from the river
and the spears of lilies
battled in the air.

I behaved only the way
a blackguard like me behaves.
I offered her a big creel
of hay-colored satins.
I had no wish to fall for her.
She has a husband after all,
though she was still a virgin
when I led her to the river."
1685,Yannis Keats,Angelos Sikelianos,"A branch, the hand of Apollo,
The plane tree’s polished, broad bough,
Spread above you, may it bring you
The universe’s immortal peace.

You’d meet me on the broad and shining shore
            Of Pylos, so I’d planned,
With Mentor’s tall ship pulled up on the beach
            Snug in the sand.

We would be bound, as those who sailed with the gods,
            In the winged friendship of youth,
And would take our seats in the stone thrones that Time
            And custom had made smooth

And meet that man who still in the third generation
            Reigned serene, a sage
Whose tales of travels and holy decrees had ripened
            In his mind with age—

At dawn, we’d attend the sacrifice to the gods,
            The ritual slaughters
Of the three-year-old heifers, and hear the single cry
            That rose from his three daughters

When the axe thwacked, and the black-fringed, slow-rolling eye
            Drowned in a swoon
Of darkness, and the gilt horns were rendered idle,
            A hazy half moon.

My love imagined you, as a sister her brother,
            In your virginal bath,
How Polycaste rinsed your naked body and dressed you
            In a robe of fine cloth.

I thought to prod you a little with my foot
            As dawn was about to break:
 The gleaming chariot’s yoked for us and ready.
            No time to lose! Awake!

And to spend all day in the talk that comes and goes,
            Or silence, when no one spoke,
While we drove the horses who were always leaning one way
            Or another against the yoke,

But most of all I wanted to see your eyes,
            Your deer-like eyes, behold
The palace of Menelaus, and forget themselves
            In bronze and the gleam of gold,

Unwavering gaze, sinking the sight so deep,
            You’d never remember
The figured silver, the ivory, gilded or white,
            The heavy amber,

And I thought that I would say in a hushed voice
            Leaning close to your ear,
 Watch out, my friend, because in a moment, soon,
            Helen will appear

 Before our very eyes, the one and only
            Daughter of the Swan,
 And then we will sink our eyelids in the river
            Of Oblivion.

                                             •

So brightly I saw you; but what grassy roads
            Have led me to your tomb!
And the blazing roses with which I strew your grave
            And make all Rome abloom,

Light the way unto your golden songs
            As though they were the brave,
Armed bodies that turn to dust before one’s eyes
            In an ancient, new-breached grave,

And all the worthy treasure of Mycenae,
            The golden plunder
I thought to lay before you—goblet, sword,
            And diadem—past wonder,

A mask on your dead beauty like the mask
            That covered the face
Of the king of the Achaeans—all gold, all artifice,
            Hammered upon Death’s trace."
1686,One’s Ship Comes In,Joe Paddock,"I swear
my way now will be
to continue without
plan or hope, to accept
the drift of things, to shift
from endless effort
to joy in, say,
that robin, plunging
into the mossy shallows
of my bird bath and
splashing madly till
the air shines with spray.
Joy it will be, say,
in Nancy, pretty in pink
and rumpled T-shirt,
rubbing sleep from her eyes, or
joy even in
just this breathing, free
of fright and clutch, knowing
how one’s ship comes in
with each such breath."

1688,The Visible World,Jorie Graham,"I dig my hands into the absolute. The surface

into shingled, grassed clusters; lifts.
If I press, pick-in with fingers, pluck,
I can unfold the loam. It is tender. It is a tender
maneuver, hands making and unmaking promises.
Diggers, forgetters. . . . A series of successive single instances . . .
Frames of reference moving . . .
The speed of light, down here, upthrown, in my hands:
bacteria, milky roots, pilgrimages of spores, deranged
                                                                 and rippling

that would thaw time, making bits of instance

taken? . . . If I look carefully, there in my hand, if I
                                                     break it apart without
crumbling: husks, mossy beginnings and endings, ruffled

 Erasure. Tell me something and then take it back.
Bring this pellucid moment—here on this page now
                                                       as on this patch
of soil, my property—bring it up to the top and out
                                                                               of

making meaning. Parch it. It isn’t hard: just take this

from its plot. Upthrown like this, I think you can
                                                             eventually
abstract it. Do you wish to?
Disentangled, it grows very very clear.
Even the mud, the sticky lemon-colored clay
hardens and then yields, crumbs.
I can’t say what it is then, but the golden-headed
                                                   hallucination,
mating, forgetting, speckling, inter-
                                           locking,
will begin to be gone from it and then its glamorous
                                                                            veil of
echoes and muddy nostalgias will
be gone. If I touch the slender new rootings they show me
                                                                            how large I
am, look at these fingers—what a pilot—I touch, I press

electricity. . . . What speed is it at?
What speed am I at here, on my knees, as the sun traverses now
                                                                                 and just begins
to touch my back. What speed where my fingers, under the
                                                                              dark oaks,
are suddenly touched, lit up—so white as they move, the ray for
                                                                                         a moment
on them alone in the small wood.
White hands in the black-green glade,
opening the muddy cartoon of the present, taking the tiny roots
                                                                                        of the moss
apart, hired hands, curiosity’s small army, so white
                                                        in these greens—
make your revolution in the invisible temple,
make your temple in the invisible
revolution—I can’t see the errands you run, hands gleaming
                                                            for this instant longer
like tinfoil at the bottom here of the tall
                                      whispering oaks . . .
Listen, Boccioni the futurist says a galloping horse
                                                               has not four
legs (it has twenty)—and “at C there is no sequence
because there is no time”—and since
at lightspeed, etc. (everything is simultaneous): my hands
serrated with desires, shoved into these excavated
                                                                           fates
—mauve, maroons, gutters of flecking golds—
my hands are living in myriad manifestations
                                                       of light. . . .
“All forms of imitation are to be despised.”
“All subjects previously used must be discarded.”
“At last we shall rush rapidly past objectiveness” . . .
Oh enslavement, will you take these hands
                                       and hold them in
for a time longer? Tops of the oaks, do you see my tiny
                                                                      golden hands
pushed, up to the wrists,
into the present? Star I can’t see in daylight, young, light
                                                                     and airy star—
I put the seed in. The beam moves on."
1689,"Act III, Sc. 2",Jorie Graham,"Look she said this is not the distance
we wanted to stay at—We wanted to get
close, very close. But what
is the way in again? And is it
 
too late? She could hear the actions
rushing past—but they are on
another track. And in the silence,
or whatever it is that follows,
 
there was still the buzzing: motes, spores,
aftereffects and whatnot recalled the morning after.
Then the thickness you can’t get past called waiting.
 
Then the you, whoever you are, peering down to see if it’s
                                                                      done yet.
Then just the look on things being looked-at.
Then just the look of things being seen."
1690,After Love,Maxine Kumin,"Afterward, the compromise.
Bodies resume their boundaries.
 
These legs, for instance, mine.
Your arms take you back in.
 
Spoons of our fingers, lips
admit their ownership.
 
The bedding yawns, a door
blows aimlessly ajar
 
and overhead, a plane
singsongs coming down.
 
Nothing is changed, except
there was a moment when
 
the wolf, the mongering wolf
who stands outside the self
 
lay lightly down, and slept."
1691,American Smooth,Rita Dove,"We were dancing—it must have
been a foxtrot or a waltz,
something romantic but
requiring restraint,
rise and fall, precise
execution as we moved
into the next song without
stopping, two chests heaving
above a seven-league
stride—such perfect agony,
one learns to smile through,
ecstatic mimicry
being the sine qua non
of American Smooth.
And because I was distracted
by the effort of
keeping my frame
(the leftward lean, head turned
just enough to gaze out
past your ear and always
smiling, smiling),
I didn’t notice
how still you’d become until
we had done it
(for two measures?
four?)—achieved flight,
that swift and serene
magnificence,
before the earth
remembered who we were
and brought us down."
1692,Eve Revisited,Alison Hawthorne Deming,"Pomegranates fell from the trees
in our sleep. If we stayed
in the sun too long
there were aloes
to cool the burn.
Henbane for predators
and succulents when the rain was scarce.
 
There was no glorified past
to point the way
true and natural
for the sexes to meet.
He kept looking to the heavens
as if the answer were anywhere
but here. I was so bored
with our goodness
I couldn’t suck the juice
from one more pear.
 
It’s here, I kept telling him,
 here, rooted in the soil
like every other tree
you know. And I wove us
a bed of its uppermost branches."
1693,First Encounter Beach,Alison Hawthorne Deming,"Eastham, Massachusetts

One of the spectators is disappointed
there isn’t a guide to explain
the beaching, the scientists busy
cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
stranded on the salt grass.
No one knows why and, try as the rescue team
might, not one whale will go back to water.
So they’re injected to speed up the dying,
 
lined up like lumber and sawed into,
except when the black skin splits
we can’t stop staring, their meat is so red.
I don’t want to know why this happens—
what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
finished their love of motion. Why should
anything have to leave this world
when water can cycle from atmosphere
down to land, the ocean and back
to forgiving sky.
 
                                      I’m on my way to Connecticut
where my father has a little vegetation
on his heart valve—that’s how the intern
describes it, trying to minimize
the danger of him slipping
into a haze so cold, some nights,
bone-cold, his hand can’t get from
his plate to his mouth.
 
                                                  Rain slicks the highway
slowing me down. The same water
fattened into snow in the woods
of my childhood, the whiteness
unbroken except where my father
cut trails and taught me to ski,
laying down the herringbone behind him
as he broke up hills that left me
with legs made of slush. He wanted me strong,
no patience for pain. No choice
but to find the muscle to follow. Even now
when he boasts how I zigzagged
the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
there’s no hint of my knee-chattering fear,
slats skittering out of control,
each run a victory of luck more than will,
each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
I wonder how it is for him now
there in the ward where whiteness can’t hide
the cold blank that’s ahead. When the whales
beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
each new arrival scanning the faces
of those heading back to their cars
to see how it changed them
to survey so much death. Nothing showed.
Their eyes followed the asphalt,
heads bent in private devotion.
 
                                                    There in a room
where others have died, my father
keeps a record of each test and drug.
He watches medicine drip into his arm
and circle in the dark of his blood.
I believe it will heal him, as I believe
in the strength of my blood
to protect me from failures of will. Once
when my grandmother at ninety-six
lay delirious with pneumonia,
pitching on her high horsehair bed,
she saw three crows perched on the dresser.
 
              They smell so awful, she said.
 Please, open the window. Let them out.
It was my father who did what she asked.
And the crows flew out, carrying her fever
over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
and she lived. Whatever she saw,
by love, luck or dumb Yankee will,
it was true. That’s what I mean by medicine."
1694,Himself,Thomas P. Lynch,"He’ll have been the last of his kind here then.
The flagstones, dry-stone walls, the slumping thatch,
out-offices and cow cabins, the patch
of haggard he sowed spuds and onions in—
all of it a century out of fashion—
all giving way to the quiet rising damp
of hush and vacancy once he is gone.
Those long contemplations at the fire, cats
curling at the door, the dog’s lame waltzing,
the kettle, the candle and the lamp—
all still, all quenched, all darkened—
the votives and rosaries and novenas,
the pope and Kennedy and Sacred Heart,
the bucket, the basket, the latch and lock,
the tractor that took him into town and back
for the pension cheque and messages and pub,
the chair, the bedstead and the chamber pot,
everything will amount to nothing much.
Everything will slowly disappear.
And some grandniece, a sister’s daughter’s daughter,
one blue August in ten or fifteen years
will marry well and will inherit it:
the cottage ruins, the brown abandoned land.
They’ll come to see it in a hired car.
The kindly Liverpudlian she’s wed,
in concert with a local auctioneer,
will post a sign to offer Site for Sale.
The acres that he labored in will merge
with a neighbor’s growing pasturage
and all the decades of him will begin to blur,
easing, as the far fields of his holding did,
up the hill, over the cliff, into the sea."
1695,Horse Horse Hyphen Hyphen,Marilyn Chin,"Border Ghazals

I.
 
I hate, I love, I don’t know how
I’m biracial, I’m torn in two
 
Tonight, he will lock me in fear
In the metal detector of love
 
Rapeflowers, rapeseeds, rapiers
A soldier’s wry offerings
 
He will press his tongue
Into my neighing throat
 
I can speak three dialects badly
I want you now behind the blue door
 
In a slow hovercraft of dreams
I saw Nanking from a bilge
 
Some ashes fell on his lap
I’m afraid it’s my mother
 
The protocol is never to mention her
While we are fucking

The bad conceit, the bad conceit police will arrest you
Twin compasses, twin compasses cannot come
 
Your father is not a car, not a compass and not God
Though he vanished in his sky-blue convertible Galaxy with a blonde
 
He kept crawling back to us, back to us
Each time with a fresh foot mangled
 
One emperor was named Lickety, the other named Split
Suddenly, the soup of chaos makes sense
 
Refugees roaming from tent to tent to tent, looking for love
The banknote is a half note, an octave above God
 
O the great conjugator of curses: shit, shat, have shut!
I have loved you both bowl-cut and shagged
 
There are days when the sun is a great gash
Nights, the moon smokes hashish and falls asleep on your lap
 
Sorry, but your morphing was not satisfactory
Shapeshifter, you choked on your magic scarf
 
 
III.
 
I heard this joke at the bar
An agnostic dyslexic insomniac stayed up all night searching for doG
 
The prosperity sign flips right side up again
The Almanac says this Ox Year we’ll toil like good immigrants
 
Horse is frigid. Mule can’t love
Salmon dead at the redd
 
One leg is stationary, the other must tread, must tread, must tread
The Triads riddled him, then us
 
What is the heart’s past participle?
She would have loved not to have loved
 
I bought you at the corner of Agave and Revolucíon
You wrapped yourself thrice around my green arm and shat!
 
A childless woman can feel the end of all existence
 Look, on that bloody spot, Chrysanthemum!
 
Shamanka, fetch your grandmother at the bus stop
Changeling, you are the one I love"
1696,Hymn,A. R. Ammons,"I know if I find you I will have to leave the earth
and go on out
     over the sea marshes and the brant in bays
and over the hills of tall hickory
and over the crater lakes and canyons
and on up through the spheres of diminishing air
past the blackset noctilucent clouds
           where one wants to stop and look
way past all the light diffusions and bombardments
up farther than the loss of sight
    into the unseasonal undifferentiated empty stark
 
And I know if I find you I will have to stay with the earth
inspecting with thin tools and ground eyes
trusting the microvilli sporangia and simplest
     coelenterates
and praying for a nerve cell
with all the soul of my chemical reactions
and going right on down where the eye sees only traces
 
You are everywhere partial and entire
You are on the inside of everything and on the outside
 
I walk down the path down the hill where the sweetgum
has begun to ooze spring sap at the cut
and I see how the bark cracks and winds like no other bark
chasmal to my ant-soul running up and down
and if I find you I must go out deep into your
    far resolutions
and if I find you I must stay here with the separate leaves"
1697,Intensive Care Unit,Adrien Stoutenburg,"In one corner of the ward
somebody was eating a raw chicken.
The cheerful nurses did not see.
With the tube down my throat
I could not tell them.
Nor did they notice the horror show
on the TV set suspended over my windowless bed.
The screen was dead
but a torn face was clear.
 
   I did not see my own
in a mirror for weeks.
When it happened,
when I dared to face my face
after the ravaging,
it was not mine
but something whittled, honed down
to a sly resemblance.
It, even the mirror, the pale room,
the oxygen tank
neat and black as a bomb
in its portable crate—
all was hallucination.
 
   But the bloody rooster,
the stray pieces of bodies
slung into dreamless nooks,
the white-haired doll whimpering
on a gift counter—
those were real.
 
   I keep living there.
Foolish. I am home. Half safe."
1698,Mechanism,A. R. Ammons,"Honor a going thing, goldfinch, corporation, tree,
          morality: any working order,
       animate or inanimate: it
 
has managed directed balance,
          the incoming and outgoing energies are working right,
       some energy left to the mechanism,
 
some ash, enough energy held
          to maintain the order in repair,
       assure further consumption of entropy,
 
expending energy to strengthen order:
          honor the persisting reactor,
       the container of change, the moderator: the yellow
 
bird flashes black wing-bars
          in the new-leaving wild cherry bushes by the bay,
       startles the hawk with beauty,
 
flitting to a branch where
          flash vanishes into stillness,
       hawk addled by the sudden loss of sight:
 
honor the chemistries, platelets, hemoglobin kinetics,
          the light-sensitive iris, the enzymic intricacies
       of control,
 
the gastric transformations, seed
          dissolved to acrid liquors, synthesized into
       chirp, vitreous humor, knowledge,
 
blood compulsion, instinct: honor the
          unique genes,
       molecules that reproduce themselves, divide into
 
sets, the nucleic grain transmitted
          in slow change through ages of rising and falling form,
       some cells set aside for the special work, mind
 
or perception rising into orders of courtship,
          territorial rights, mind rising
       from the physical chemistries
 
to guarantee that genes will be exchanged, male
          and female met, the satisfactions cloaking a deeper
       racial satisfaction:
 
heat kept by a feathered skin:
          the living alembic, body heat maintained (bunsen
       burner under the flask)
 
so the chemistries can proceed, reaction rates
          interdependent, self-adjusting, with optimum
       efficiency—the vessel firm, the flame
 
staying: isolated, contained reactions! the precise and
          necessary worked out of random, reproducible,
       the handiwork redeemed from chance, while the
 
goldfinch, unconscious of the billion operations
          that stay its form, flashes, chirping (not a
       great songster) in the bay cherry bushes wild of leaf."

Black swollen fruit dangling on a limb
Red forgotten flesh sprayed across the prairie
Parched brown vines creeping over the wall
Yellow winged pollen, invisible enemies
 
Boluses without homesteads, grubs without a voice
Burrowed deeply into this land’s dark, dark heart
Someday, our pods and pupae shall turn in the earth
And burgeon into our motherlode’s bold beauty
 
 
II.
 
We’re a seed on the manure, on the sole of your shoe
We’re the louse trapped in your hank of golden hair
We’re the sliver that haunts beneath your thumbnail
We're the church mouse you scorched with a match but lived
 
We’re the package wrapped, return address unknown
We’re the arm lowered again, again, a bloodied reverie
We’ve arrived shoeless, crutchless, tousle-haired, swollen-bellied
We shall inherit this earth’s meek glory, as foretold
 
 
III. (For Leah, my niece)
 
They gave you a title, but you were too proud to wear it
They gave you the paterland, but you were too lazy to farm it
 
Your condo is leaking, but you’re too angry to repair it
Your dress has moth holes, but you’re too sentimental to toss it
 
You’re too bored to play the lute, it hangs on the wall like an ornament
The piano bites you, it’s an eight-legged unfaithful dog
 
Love grows in the garden, but you’re too impudent to tend it
A nice Hakka boy from Ogden, so hardworking, so kind
 
The prayer mat is for prayer, not for catamite nipple-piercing
The Goddess wags her finger at your beautiful wasteland
 
A dream deferred, well, is a dream deferred
 
 
IV. (Janie’s retort, on her fortieth birthday)
 
The same stars come around and around and around
The same sun pecks her heat at the horizon
The same housing tract, the same shopping center
The same blunt haircut: Chinese, Parisian, Babylonion
The same lipstick: red and it comes off on your coffeecup
The same stars come around and around and around
The same sun tarries in the late noon sky
The same word for mom: Ah ma, madre, mere, majka
The same birthbabe: bald, purplish, you slap to make cry
The same stench: mother’s milk, shit and vomit
The same argument between a man and a woman
The same dog, hit by a car, the same escaped canary
The same turkey for Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year
The same three-tiered freeway: Istanbul, Tokyo, San Diego
The same hill, the same shanty town, the same lean-to
The same skyscraper: Hong Kong, Singapore, Toledo
The same soup: chicken, though the veggies may vary
The same rice for supper: white, brown or wild
The same stars come around and around and around
The same sun dips her head into the ocean
The same tree in the same poem by the same poet
The same old husband: saggy breasts, baggy thighs
The same blackness whether we sleep or die

Whoever abandoned her grandmother at the bus stop
Whoever ran in and out the door like a blind wind

Whoever lost her virtue    in darkly paneled rooms    with white boys
Whoever prayed for round eyes
   and taped her eyelids in waiting
Whoever wore platform shoes
   blustering taller than her own kind
Whoever sold her yellow gold for Jehovah
Whoever discarded her jade Buddha for Christ

Why are you proud, father, entombed with the other woman?
Why are you proud, mother, knitting my shroud in heaven?
Why are you proud, fish, you feed the greedy mourners?
Why are you proud, peonies, your heads are bowed and weighty?
Why are you proud, millennium, the dialect will die with you?
Why are you proud, psalm, hammering yourself into light?"
1700,Still Burning,Gerald Stern,"Me trying to understand say whence
say whither, say what, say me with a pencil walking,
say reading the dictionary, say learning medieval

William James I loved him, swimming breaststroke
and thinking for an hour, how did I get here?
Or thinking in line, say the 69 streetcar
or 68 or 67 Swissvale,
that would take me elsewhere, me with a textbook
reading the pre-Socratics, so badly written,
whoever the author was, me on the floor of
the lighted stacks sitting cross-legged,
walking afterwards through the park or sometimes
running across the bridges and up the hills,
sitting down in our tiny diningroom,
burning in a certain way, still burning."
1701,The Beak of the Pelican,J. Patrick Lewis,"She looks for wiggly fishes,
At least so it appears,
To stuff inside the suitcase
That's swinging from her ears.

How does she get that faceful
Of luggage off the ground?"

1703,First Girls in Little League Baseball,J. Patrick Lewis,"December 26, 1974
Title IX of the 1972 Education Act is signed, providing for equal opportunity in athletics for girls as well as boys.

The year was 1974
When Little Leaguers learned the score.
President Ford took out his pen,
And signed a law that said from then
On women too would have the chance
To wear the stripes and wear the pants.
Now what you hear, as flags unfurl,
Is ""Atta boy!"" and ""Atta girl!"""
1704,First Men on the Moon,J. Patrick Lewis,"""The Eagle has landed!"" —Apollo II Commander Neil A. Armstrong
""A magnificent desolation!"" — Air Force Colonel Edwin E. ""Buzz"" Aldrin, Jr.
July 20, 1969
 

That afternoon in mid-July,
Two pilgrims watched from distant space
The moon ballooning in the sky.
They rose to meet it face-to-face.

Their spidery spaceship, Eagle, dropped
Down gently on the lunar sand.
And when the module's engines stopped,
Rapt silence fell across the land.

The first man down the ladder, Neil,
Spoke words that we remember now—
“One small step...” It made us feel
As if we were there too, somehow.

When Neil planted the flag and Buzz
Collected lunar rocks and dust,
They hopped like kangaroos because
Of gravity. Or wanderlust?

A quarter million miles away,
One small blue planet watched in awe.
And no one who was there that day
Will soon forget the sight they saw."
1705,Mosquito,J. Patrick Lewis,"I was climbing up the sliding board
When suddenly I felt
A mosquito bite my bottom
And it raised a big red welt.

So I said to that mosquito,
“I'm sure you wouldn't mind
If I took a pair of tweezers
And I tweezered your behind!”

He shriveled up his body
And he shuffled to his feet,
And he said, “I'm awfully sorry
But a skeeter's got to eat!
Still, there are mosquito manners,
And I must have just forgot 'em.
And I swear I'll never never never
Bite another bottom.”

But a minute later Archie Hill
And Buck and Theo Brown
Were horsing on the monkey bars,
Hanging upside down.
They must have looked delicious
From a skeeter's point of view
'Cause he bit 'em on the bottoms,
Archie, Buck and Theo too!

You could hear 'em goin' HOLY!
You could hear 'em goin' WHACK!
You could hear 'em cuss and holler,
Goin' smack, smack, smack.

A mosquito's awful sneaky,
A mosquito's mighty sly,
But I never never never
Thought a skeeter'd tell a lie."
1706,"One Cow, Two Moos",J. Patrick Lewis,"We used to have a single cow,
We called her Mrs. Rupple.
But she got struck by a lightning bolt,
And now we have a couple.

She's walking sort of funny now,
Oh pity her poor calf.
Old Mrs. Rupple gives no milk,
She gives us half-and-half."
1707,Said the Toad,J. Patrick Lewis,"I was really in a muddle
looking over a mud puddle
'cause I didn't have a paddle
or a twig to ride the reef.
But I said, Oh, fiddle-faddle,
this is just a little piddle
of a second fiddle puddle
so I saddled up a leaf.
I set sail on the puddle,
but I reached the muddy middle
and I rocked the leaf a little,
then I gave it all I had.
And I solved the mighty riddle
of the whole caboodle puddle
when I hopped up on the middle
of a beetle launching pad."
1708,Snake Song,J. Patrick Lewis,"Toad gots measles
Frog gots mumps
Both gots such
Disgusting bumps.

They so ugly
It's a sin.
They be jumpin'
Out that skin.

Pay no mind
These creepy items
Close my eyes
I bite 'ems, bite 'ems."
1709,Tom Tigercat,J. Patrick Lewis,"Tom Tigercat is noted
for his manners and his wit.
He wouldn't think of lion,
No, he doesn't cheetah bit.
Tom never pretended
to be something that he's not.
I guess that's why we like him
and why he likes ocelot."
1710,Vinegar,J. Patrick Lewis,"It was such a lovely day
Till I stumbled in the way
Of a van that carries vinegar to stores.
When I glared up at the man—
Operator of the van—
He said, “Vinegar, it never rains but pours!”

Now a skunk was standing by.
And I thought that I would cry
From the vinegar that sprayed and soaked my clothes,
When the driver kindly yells,
“Watch that animal. It smells!”—
And the skunk ran off, a hankie to her nose."
1711,What to Wear Where,J. Patrick Lewis,"When I was a boy
In Looziana,
We wore blue jeans
And a red bandanna.
 
My folks moved up
To the state of Maine,
We wore duck shoes
In slicker-suit rain.
 
My folks moved down
To the state of Texas,
We wore brand names
Like Lazy X’s.
 
Now that we’re living
It up in Vermont,
We wear pretty much
Whatever we want."
1712,Peace Lilies,Cathy Smith Bowers,"I collect them now, it seems. Like
sea-shells or old
thimbles. One for
Father. One for

Mother. Two for my sweet brothers.
Odd how little
they require of
me. Unlike the

ones they were sent in memory
of. No sudden
shrilling of the
phone. No harried

midnight flights. Only a little
water now and
then. Scant food and
light. See how I’ve

brought them all together here in
this shaded space
beyond the stairs.
Even when they

thirst, they summon me with nothing
more than a soft,
indifferent furl-
ing of their leaves.﻿"

IN LIGHT ROOM IN DARK HELL IN UMBER IN CHROME,
     I sit feeling the swell of the cloud made about by movement
 
                 of arm leg and tongue. In reflections of gold
           light. Tints and flashes of gold and amber spearing
                     and glinting. Blur glass…blue Glass,
 
             black telephone. Matchflame of violet and flesh
                 seen in the clear bright light. It is not night
 
                and night too. In Hell, there are stars outside.
            And long sounds of cars. Brown shadows on walls
                                       in the light
                           of the room. I sit or stand
 
                 wanting the huge reality of touch and love.
            In the turned room. Remember the long-ago dream
 
          of stuffed animals (owl, fox) in a dark shop. Wanting
             only the purity of clean colors and new shapes
                                     and feelings.
                 I WOULD CRY FOR THEM USELESSLY

      The telephone in cataleptic light. Marchflames of blue and red seen in the
                                                                                                                            clear grain.
I see myself—ourselves—in Hell without radiance. Reflections that we are.
 
              The long cars make sounds and brown shadows over the wall.
 
                               I am real as you are real whom I speak to.
                   I raise my head, see over the edge of my nose. Look up
 
                    and see that nothing is changed. There is no flash
                            to my eyes. No change to the room.
 
                        Vita Nuova—No! The dead, dead world.
                     The strain of desire is only a heroic gesture.
                       An agony to be so in pain without release
 
                             when love is a word or kiss."
1716,Five Psalms,Mark Jarman,"1.
Let us think of God as a lover
       Who never calls,
Whose pleasure in us is aroused
       In unrepeatable ways,
God as a body we cannot
       Separate from desire,
Saying to us, “Your love
       Is only physical.”
Let us think of God as a bronze
       With green skin
Or a plane that draws the eye close
       To the texture of paint.
Let us think of God as life,
       A bacillus or virus,
As death, an igneous rock
       In a quartz garden.
Then, let us think of kissing
       God with the kisses
Of our mouths, of lying with God,
       As sea worms lie,
Snugly petrifying
       In their coral shirts.
Let us think of ourselves
       As part of God,
Neither alive nor dead,
       But like Alpha, Omega,
Glyphs and hieroglyphs,
       Numbers, data.

First forgive the silence
       That answers prayer,
Then forgive the prayer
       That stains the silence.
 
Excuse the absence
       That feels like presence,
Then excuse the feeling
       That insists on presence.
 
Pardon the delay
       Of revelation,
Then ask pardon for revealing
       Your impatience.
 
Forgive God
       For being only a word,
Then ask God to forgive
       The betrayal of language.

The new day cancels dread
       And dawn forgives all sins,
All the judgments of insomnia,
       As if they were only dreams.
 
The ugly confrontation
       After midnight, with the mirror,
Turns white around the edges
       And burns away like frost.
 
Daylight undoes gravity
       And lightness responds to the light.
The new day lifts all weight,
       Like stepping off into space.
 
Where is that room you woke to,
       By clock-light, at 3 a.m.?
Nightmare’s many mansions,
       Falling, have taken it with them.
 
The new day, the day’s newness,
       And the wretchedness that, you thought,
Would never, never depart,
       Meet—and there is goodbye.
 
A bad night lies ahead
       And a new day beyond that—
A simple sequence, but hard
       To remember in the right order.

Lord of dimensions and the dimensionless,
Wave and particle, all and none,
 
Who lets us measure the wounded atom,
Who lets us doubt all measurement,
 
When in this world we betray you
Let us be faithful in another."
1717,How You Know,Joe Mills,"How do you know if it’s love? she asks, 
and I think if you have to ask, it’s not, 
but I know this won’t help. I want to say 
you’re too young to worry about it,
as if she has questions about Medicare 
or social security, but this won’t help either. 
“You’ll just know” is a lie, and one truth, 
“when you still want to be with them 
the next morning,” would involve too 
many follow-up questions. The difficulty 
with love, I want to say, is sometimes 
you only know afterwards that it’s arrived 
or left. Love is the elephant and we 
are the blind mice unable to understand 
the whole. I want to say love is this 
desire to help even when I know I can’t, 
just as I couldn’t explain electricity, stars, 
the color of the sky, baldness, tornadoes, 
fingernails, coconuts, or the other things 
she has asked about over the years, all 
those phenomena whose daily existence 
seems miraculous. Instead I shake my head. 
I don’t even know how to match my socks. 
Go ask your mother. She laughs and says, 
I did. Mom told me to come and ask you."
1718,Interesting Times,Mark Jarman,"Everything’s happening on the cusp of tragedy, the tip of comedy, the pivot of event.
You want a placid life, find another planet. This one is occupied with the story’s arc:
About to happen, on the verge, horizontal. You want another planet, try the moon.
Try any of the eight, try Planet X. It’s out there somewhere, black with serenity.
How interesting will our times become? How much more interesting can they become?
 
A crow with something dangling from its beak flaps onto a telephone pole top, daintily,
And croaks its victory to other crows and tries to keep its morsel to itself.
A limp shape, leggy, stunned, drops from the black beak’s scissors like a rag.
We drive past, commenting, and looking upward. A sunny morning, too cold to be nesting,
Unless that is a nest the crow has seized, against the coming spring.
 
We’ve been at this historical site before, but not in any history we remember.
The present has been cloaked in cloud before, and not on any holy mountaintop.
To know the stars will one day fly apart so far they can’t be seen
Is almost a relief. For the future flies in one direction—toward us.
And the only way to sidestep it—the only way—is headed this way, too.
 
So, look. That woman’s got a child by the hand. She’s dragging him across the street.
He’s crying and she’s shouting, but we see only dumbshow. Their breath is smoke.
Will she give in and comfort him? Will he concede at last? We do not know.
Their words are smoke. In a minute they’ll be somewhere else entirely.
Everyone in a minute will be somewhere else entirely. As the crow flies."
1719,Mexico Seen from the Moving Car ﻿,Michael McClure,"THERE ARE HILLS LIKE SHARKFINS
                                  and clods of mud.
The mind drifts through
in the shape of a museum,
in the guise of a museum
dreaming dead friends:
Jim, Tom, Emmet, Bill.
—Like billboards their huge faces droop
and stretch on the walls,
on the walls of the cliffs out there,
where trees with white trunks
          makes plumes on rock ridges.
 
My mind is fingers holding a pen.
 
Trees with white trunks
             make plumes on rock ridges.
Rivers of sand are memories.
Memories make movies
             on the dust of the desert.
Hawks with pale bellies
             perch on the cactus,
their bodies are portholes
             to other dimensions.
 
This might go on forever.
 
I am a snake and a tiptoe feather
at opposite ends of the scales
as they balance themselves
against each other.
This might go on forever."
1720,The Truly Great,Stephen Spender,"I think continually of those who were truly great.
Who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history
Through corridors of light, where the hours are suns,
Endless and singing. Whose lovely ambition
Was that their lips, still touched with fire,
Should tell of the Spirit, clothed from head to foot in song.
And who hoarded from the Spring branches
The desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.
 
What is precious, is never to forget
The essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs
Breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth.
Never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light
Nor its grave evening demand for love.
Never to allow gradually the traffic to smother
With noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.
 
Near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields,
See how these names are fêted by the waving grass
And by the streamers of white cloud
And whispers of wind in the listening sky.
The names of those who in their lives fought for life,
Who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre.
Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun
And left the vivid air signed with their honour."
1721,At the Altar,Eleanor Ross Taylor,"That bag you packed me
when you sent me
to the universe—
camp after camp I’ve opened it
debating whether to unpack—
        Not yet, not yet—
Why did I feel so much in it
was dangerous on the playground,
too good for everyday,
feel those splendid fireworks
hazardous to institutions,
unmannerly to etiquette,
so that, time after time,
I found myself saying
       Not yet?
 
At each new place I faced it,
it suggested,
Here spread out your things,
put on this coat,
open this bottle—
       No, not yet . . .
sometimes throwing something out,
giving things away,
lightening my load. . . .
 
The more I pull out,
the more it seems, some days,
is left inside,
the heavier it is.
 
Sometimes I think this package
is almost a door
the opening of which
careening across heaven
could be fatal.
 
Some days now I wonder if I’ll ever
dare face my given garments—
permanently wrinkled,
surely out of date—
your travel-thought
wasting in its tissue, flesh-corrupt—
till I’ve absorbed it,
like those stitches that dissolve
in an incision
where something’s been removed."
1722,Beech Forest,Stephen Sandy,"Light from the ugliest lamp I ever saw, here
on the table that triples for reading, eating (can’t say
dining), business on the phone; ugliest except
a few around the corner in that guest house at windows
 
—plaster driftwood; cylinders like rockets or sanitary
napkins propping shades; thin torso of a youth;
red globe on orange globe, the works, somebody’s
collection. Wouldn’t she love this one, lump of lamp base
 
intending landscape, two donkeys in mustard glaze,
heads ruefully down, one carrying two rush panniers
large enough to hold your pens or salts and peppers; on
the other a shifty man with droopy moustache rides,
 
**
 
grumping under his sombrero; right leg broken
off at the knee, left leg clipped at ankle. They make
no progress, this mold-made work—the joins, arthritic
ridges where dabs of grayish green suggest
 
a wizened bush from which a brass post rises
to hold a shade that doesn’t fit and twice
has tried to burn, as crusty sores at the rim show.
Still, it lights my work. Why hate it? Do I care?
 
These indecorous furnishings stand for failure, are
a clutter that weighs down, defeats the purpose,
like dumbbells taken along on vacations; the pen jar;
lamp base, sextant, portable folding triptych.
 
**
 
The writing table fills with clutter. Specials
coax me to nudge buying into play. A checkout
coupon lets me get some brand of lunch meats
fifty-five cents off if I spend two dollars
 
but I just can’t find it when I’m shopping, the ticket—
with its rubric of good news and inscrutable forest
of bar code, black on red—to lead me on; back home
there it is, on the table, laying waste my power to spend.
 
What I have wanted (with Larkin) to do must be
“essentially undoable, it belongs to the imagination.”
Rather, the demolition has begun, piss and shit
and blood mix in the snow-white bowl; and yet
 
**
 
I find the Beech Forest (behind the beach
dunes) that Allen recommended “without
reservation.” The man was right—it more
than satisfies, these beech ponds and their dune
 
forest. I sat on a pitch pine that had blown
over and then turned round and risen again,
and bowed part making a seat something like
a saddle; the tree was growing while I sat on it
 
as were the other pitch pines round the pond ruddy
in afternoon, late light of day, rough trunks
with tufts of twisted branches green with needles,
it was idyllic, wind speaking through the pines,
 
**
 
solitude:—O, yes, two high-breasted girls
came striding by, I heard them coming, I
heard them going, yammering at full volume
not looking left or right, they passed me, were
 
out of sight and soon of earshot, Doppler effect
caused by exuberant youth in oblivious chitchat.
And people are smoking in these dry woods too,
not policing their butts is how I know,
 
the butts will surface from the heavier, sifting sand,
sand spilling, surfing down hills, crashing in waves
over the path here. But call it solitude,
when a thought—but wait! I thought—I should not be
 
**
 
having a thought here, this moment: yet a vision
of a Chinese poet in his study overlooking
such a pond as this arrives out of the silence
like the yellow water lilies on the water, pads
 
spreading out in files like a design on the broadloom
of a lobby. The sage is working on a poem, brushing it
on silk, inspired by a blend of Tao and
Confucius. Doubtless he would not forget
 
allusions to Sung poets, if he were not
a Sung poet himself, in which case he would have to
echo Han or T’ang; and he would be writing
of solitude; time passing; absent friends
 
**
 
(enlightenment would have to be inferred).
No matter, I didn’t bring a pen today.
However, over there are inkberry bushes, so
with a reed I just might make a start. . . . Farther
 
on the path I listen to a bird, a warbler perhaps,
I do not know the song or see the bird.
There with the pines and sand and birdsong, and no
prayer- or guide- or selfhelp-book, no
 
serious commune, the mind must yearn to be
led on; it wants a deity, an altar to approach;
an altar at least to take steps toward; occasion
to rise to—with nothing planned for the mind,
 
**
 
it’s like a person suddenly blind, not blind
for a long time and knowing the ropes, but just
now, rope-stung, blind—and groping, feeling around
for the way, any way, or, closer to home,
 
when the power goes at night just getting from
here to there even though you know the drill,
—you never find the batteries when you need them,
groping down cellar for the circuit breaker then
 
you flip it; nothing, it’s a bigger failure you are part of—
know the layout in general yet without ceremony
the mind leans forward, over an edge, hoping for,
needing a little ritual, like a guide rail to keep it
 
**
 
from falling, going down. Even then the mind
finds need of other news, keeps on desiring
alterity somewhere at hand. For example,
walking the streets of Provincetown, nothing to see
 
but lots to look at, all that fluff and buff,
the Michelin-man day-trippers aching along;
suddenly I want a prayer book, maybe not
 Bottles and Stools or The Little Red Book but still . . .
 
even a pocket copy of A Shropshire Lad,
such as I find soon after all the buff and fluff
at Tim’s, the only bookstore on the street,
handy for quick reads. Thin as a shortbread biscuit,
 
**
 
THE RICHARDS PRESS LONDON 1915, no doubt
with its khaki cover, intended for some Tommy’s
backpack, a backward solace for off-duty hours
in the trenches: admittedly not very much
 
on the other hand just the thing I’m talking after;
a talisman perhaps is all, an amulet
with words that say, buck up, come on, you’ll make it,
 there’s something on after all this, no matter
 
what the words say. Housman’s “vision,” his drear
anguish of love for someone, something, lad
and landscape that never were, that might shoot threads
of gold among the bloody muslins and the mud;
 
**
 
mind wants other news than what the ruffled senses
bring data of—smoke or flesh or birdsong.
It saw there was a space within, reserved
for turning toward another; other; that
 
no bullet, arrowwood or beach plum might
fill, though these could occupy that space
a moment.
                    Again I heard the casual chirping
of that bird, off in that tupelo, the song
 
I did not know, below the cries of gull
and jay I did. The unknown I saw was not
enough to satisfy; or—satisfied when it
was framed, complement of what is known for sure.
 
**
 
It’s—like—when you go someplace strange, new,
the seashore, any boundary, you want to learn the names
of plants. Start looking at the edges of leaves. It gives
a grip on where you are, and who, or seems to,
 
to know bullbrier, bearberry, blueberry. You get a GUIDE
or a local to tell. On the dune path I found one, a gnarled
bush alone, hollylike but succulent leaf; nothing
like it in the book. But why feel helped in nature
 
by a name? When a horde of flower children wanted
to know what they should do to be saved (back when)
Snyder told them, “learn the names of plants;
of animals; learn to do something with your hands.”
 
**
 
Well I went out to that dune again: to cop a copy
of the leaf I took and lost: so it’s only bayberry
after all; dioecious, two-sexed: some leaves different
from others, that’s OK only one got pictured
 
in my book; but the waxiness, bayberry for sure, set
to be rendered into candles for a gifte shoppe,
nauseating noose of “scents.” Its nutlets twinkle
near the oily leaves aglow above the sand,
 
bone white. Doesn’t make me feel better to know now
about that scrawny straggler. Sanctimonious
pilgrim know-alls, Bradford & Co.! Forest
into desert, just like that. No time flat, considering."
1723,Field Effect,Joshua Clover,"For 8 months he lay in bed over the
 
difference between “the bell rings” & “he rings
 
the bell.” Did those 2 “rings” SOUND
 
DIFFERENT? The invisible disturbance which
 
is the bell’s vibration beating at the air—a
 
FIELD EFFECT—does it shift with the
 
ringer’s will? This, he thought, was the
 
smallest difference between things which the
 
human mind could hold (or almost hold, the
 
 thought-of-it falling away from the thinking,
 
a penny rolling to the horizon & so to
 
sleep . . .). He couldn’t get up. It became clear
 
that he was the murderer. Everyone knows. A
 
man standing at a podium reads from notes.
 
In the audience people nod in immaculate
 
suits, women & men. When I am done
  
 someone will transcribe what I say into speech.
  
 It will not resemble my notes. He is just THE
 
THING between his notes & his speech. This is
 
only fair, that he be the air. Some of the
 
women wear hats with feathers in them, wild,
 
candescent. In the audience is a boy named B,
 
not the letter, not the note. Another sound,
 
neither letter nor note—"
1724,Orchid & Eurydice,Joshua Clover,"In one version you must convince every living thing one by one
to weep until he climbs back into the marriage-house,
that earth about which it is said that bread is the glue of the earth.
Certainly glue is money, the phrase “the tears of things” is money,
the revelation of the Woman Clothed in the Sun is money.
The lake is a disc of bright money buying a few plain birds down,
they climb back nervously as you hurry through, plain birds like a
                                                                                                   plain song,
that moment when four or five are around your knees
like Zeno’s arrow, rising by halves, like Eurydice’s bread,
& still the possibility they might intersect,
you would be the one who was struck by a flying bird,
somewhere between a blesséd fool & village idiot,
the only one to persist outside the local economy,
drooling at travelers, holding yourself, slinging incomprehensible
                                                                                                   advice,
you would learn the trick with museum wire
where you snap the heads off quiet animals in front of the store,
tempted equally by science & dirty work. . . .
 
I am trying to invent a way for you to buy me back—"
1725,Royal,Joshua Clover,"They moved across the screen like a computer simulation.
They moved across the screen like complex models & we learned

Animals but set in gray shades for video capture with a lighter area for

Almost white they moved across the screen like a compressed

But the song was never familiar.
Because this was the only room this was the only room where we
     undressed—:

They moved across the screen across the room but it was not happening
     to us.
The image burning in.
Coated with hair & then a lighter area for the face meaning exposed
     skin.
We have learned to wear the architecture despite the sky’s numerous
     advances.
All these things—the speed & the music & the room—happened but
     not enough.
We undressed in the room we could not take off where I handcuffed
     you to the story.

They moved across the screen howling but the sound turned down.
This happened over & over again—the blue light leaking into the

Burning into the brain in a finery of filamental fire.

1726,Value Added,Stephen Sandy,"No one knew what the stones like squatting frogs
signified. There they were, fuming in rows, out
of the ground; every critic had his explanation
or hers. But—we had to remember—they
 
came to nothing, every one; those large stones
out of the earth served the systems
of those who considered them, as explaining
something about the past it was important
 
for the explainer to explain. And yet
no one had any idea truly; there was no
basis in fact for any view of them, and
they remained like their origins—or like
 
smiling Olmec babies, sweet but ominous figures
come from the earth to reproach us, almost
cheerfully, for our ignorance—a mystery, just
as the probe of our feelings came up with nothing."
1727,Bardo,Tsering Wangmo Dhompa,"A hundred and one butter lamps are offered to my uncle who
is no more.

Distraction proves fatal in death. A curtain of butter imprints
in air.

After the burning of bones, ashes are sent on pilgrimage. You are
dead, go into life, we pray. My uncle was a man given to giggles
in solemn moments.

Memory springs like crocuses in bloom. Self conscious and
precise.

Without blurring the cornea, details are resuscitated. Dried yak
meat between teeth. Semblance of what is.

Do not be distracted, Uncle who is no more.

He does not see his reflection in the river. The arching of speech
over “s” as he is becoming.

Curvature of spine as it cracked on a misty morning. A shadow
evades the wall.

You are no more, Uncle who is no more.

Every seven days he must relive his moment of expiration.
The living pray frequently amid burning juniper.

Communication efforts require the right initiative.

Somewhere along the line matters of motion and rest are resolved.

Crows pick the last offerings. You are someone else, uncle no
more."
1728,Dust,Dorianne Laux,"Someone spoke to me last night,
told me the truth. Just a few words,
but I recognized it.
I knew I should make myself get up,
write it down, but it was late,
and I was exhausted from working
all day in the garden, moving rocks.
Now, I remember only the flavor —
not like food, sweet or sharp.
More like a fine powder, like dust.
And I wasn’﻿t elated or frightened,
but simply rapt, aware.
That’﻿s how it is sometimes —
God comes to your window,
all bright light and black wings,
and you’﻿re just too tired to open it."

1730,In between,Tsering Wangmo Dhompa,"Late for the feast. Let me guess, she said, everything worked


against you.


Some pulverize experiences at the pool. When the air slaps, they


flip into the water and speak of the excitations of distress. The


stratagems of delivering an annulled emotion. And how is one to


read a nod? Is a nod an exclamation?


Does one kiss after a nod?


A woman mutters something about the tea being too weak.


The walls threaten to expose us, shadows pinch as we mutter


jouissance, jouissance, while the university teacher said the use of


the word was a considerable error. A most lamentable error, given


half of us are illiterate and unattached. Think of words in their


system of birth. Now do you see, the teacher said. Ah, see.


Dogs were barking for no reason.


Some of us went to the ghats and watched the dead burn. Woman


in white wailed, her hair a dumb struck line against her rocking


spine. We look for other distractions in a place of death.


In the afternoon meanings are extolled.


We are asked to name our loves. I will not, he said, use common


language to talk of love. I will not jump into the substance


without reinforcement. He took his body to the breeze and


swayed till we begged him to stop. The rain subsided but we were


still wet.


Thousands have died in a nod."
1731,In the Event of Change,Tsering Wangmo Dhompa,"I am saying primroses lined the pathway of toothless hedges.

I am saying the ocean shimmered like corrugated steel in the
morning sun.

The context of my story changes when you enter. Then I am dung
on the wall of the nomad’﻿s field. Then the everyday waking person.

I am nodding in your direction like fissures between dandelion fur.
Seeing in your manner.

I am speaking your pace. Slippage of silk slippers.

I say you are losing sight. I say your breasts are dry shells.

I am afraid of what I am capable of doing.

This is all a manner of stating how I prepare myself to be loved."
1732,She Is,Tsering Wangmo Dhompa,"Her voice is a roundness. On full moon days, she talks about


renouncing meat but the butcher has his routine. And blood.


M’﻿s wisdom. Still reliable.


There are sounds we cannot hear but understand in motion.


Slicing of air with hips. Crushing grass, saying these are my feet.


I want my feet in my shadow. Suffice to meet desires halfway.


Quiet. We say her chakras are in place.


When the thermos shatters, she knows the direction of its spill.


She knows how to lead and follow. Know her from this.


Sounds we cannot hear. The wind blows and we say it is cool.


Night slips under the door. We are tucked into bed and kissed


a fleeting one. Through the curtains, her voice loosens like thread


from an old blanket, row upon row. We watch her teeth in the


dark and read her words. She speaks in perfect order, facing where


the breeze can tug it towards canals stretching for sound.


Her faith abides by the cycle of the moon. See how perfect she is."
1733,Two Paintings by Gustav Klimt,Jorie Graham,"Although what glitters
         on the trees,
row after perfect row,
        is merely
the injustice
        of the world,

the chips on the bark of each
        beech tree
catching the light, the sum
        of these delays
is the beautiful, the human
        beautiful,

body of flaws.
        The dead
would give anything
        I’﻿m sure,
to step again onto
        the leafrot,

into the avenue of mottled shadows,
        the speckled
broken skins. The dead
        in their sheer
open parenthesis, what they
        wouldn’﻿t give

for something to lean on
        that won’﻿t
give way. I think I
        would weep
for the moral nature
        of this world,

for right and wrong like pools
        of shadow
and light you can step in
        and out of
crossing this yellow beech forest,
        this buchen-wald,

one autumn afternoon, late
        in the twentieth
century, in hollow light,
        in gaseous light. . . .
To receive the light
        and return it

and stand in rows, anonymous,
        is a sweet secret
even the air wishes
        it could unlock.
See how it pokes at them
        in little hooks,

the blue air, the yellow trees.
        Why be afraid?
They say when Klimt
        died suddenly
a painting, still
        incomplete,

was found in his studio,
        a woman’﻿s body
open at its point of
        entry,
rendered in graphic,
        pornographic,

detail—something like
        a scream
between her legs. Slowly,
        feathery,
he had begun to paint
        a delicate

garment (his trademark)
        over this mouth
of her body. The mouth
        of her face
is genteel, bored, feigning a need
        for sleep. The fabric

defines the surface,
        the story,
so we are drawn to it,
        its blues
and yellows glittering
        like a stand

of beech trees late
        one afternoon
in Germany, in fall.
        It is called
Buchenwald, it is
        1890. In

the finished painting
        the argument
has something to do
        with pleasure."
1734,Afternoon Happiness,Carolyn Kizer,"for John

At a party I spy a handsome psychiatrist,
And wish, as we all do, to get her advice for free.
Doctor, I’ll say, I’m supposed to be a poet.
All life’s awfulness has been grist to me.
We learn that happiness is a Chinese meal,
While sorrow is a nourishment forever.
My new environment is California Dreamer.
I’m fearful I’m forgetting how to brood.
And, Doctor, another thing has got me worried:
I’m not drinking as much as I should . . .
 
At home, I want to write a happy poem
On love, or a love poem of happiness.
But they won’t do, the tensions of every day,
The rub, the minor abrasions of any two
Who share one space. Ah, there’s no substitute for tragedy!
But in this chapter, tragedy belongs
To that other life, the old life before us.
Here is my aphorism of the day:
Happy people are monogamous.
Even in California. So how does the poem play
 
Without the paraphernalia of betrayal and loss?
I don’t have a jealous eye or fear
And neither do you. In truth, I’m fond
Of your ex-mate, whom I name “my wife-in-law.”
My former husband, that old disaster, is now just funny,
So laugh we do, in what Cyril Connolly
Has called the endless, nocturnal conversation
Of marriage. Which may be the best part.
Darling, must I love you in light verse
Without the tribute of profoundest art?
 
Of course it won’t last. You will break my heart
Or I yours, by dying. I could weep over that.
But now it seems forced, here in these heaven hills,
The mourning doves mourning, the squirrels mating,
My old cat warm in my lap, here on our terrace
As from below comes a musical cursing
As you mend my favorite plate. Later of course
I could pick a fight; there is always material in that.
But we don’t come from fighting people, those
Who scream out red-hot iambs in their hate.
 
No, love, the heavy poem will have to come
From temps perdu, fertile with pain, or perhaps
Detonated by terrors far beyond this place
Where the world rends itself, and its tainted waters
Rise in the east to erode our safety here.
Much as I want to gather a lifetime thrift
And craft, my cunning skills tied in a knot for you,
There is only this useless happiness as gift.﻿"
1735,"Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon, and the Brown Boy’﻿s Mother",Ronaldo V. Wilson,"When he wakes up out of sleep, the brown boy remembers two things: his white man calls and breaks the groans of Kevin Bacon, naked and writhing in pain on a hard and wet black street. Bacon has been beaten with broken bottles and has had his chest smashed in with a large flaming couch section. A mob of whites poured gasoline all over his chiseled stomach and then lit him afire. Brad Pitt lay next to him, his stomach breathless and glistening in the flame’s light.


     The brown boy knows this is somewhere between movie and dream, staring at each stomach; but more importantly, he knows that despite the fire, the bodies did not burn. They did not char or turn black. They simply shined in sweat.


     The brown boy will commit to his memory, most, Brad Pitt’s dying, and how he eventually turned over on his stomach, his penis turned down and scrape fucking the street—Brad Pitt ejaculating and on fire, the liquid shooting out of him as he looked up, staggered to his feet to let out something between groaning and laughter out to the black sky. Though Pitt had been beaten with bottles and wood, it was not clear where he was hurt, only that he was a screaming surface, dripping with lit gasoline and semen.


     As the brown boy ponders this surface, the white man has chosen to phone his brown boy. Their first conversation of the day is bound by this scene—and dutifully, for the white man, he wants to start from the beginning:


 

Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon are in a boxing ring in the middle of a football field. They are both wearing white boxer shorts, no gloves, and about to perform a dance routine. I am standing next to them, looking at Brad Pitt’s hair flop down over his face. He smiles at me before the music starts. From everywhere, broken glass bottles hurl at their bodies, and they are splashed with gasoline. We are also in a dark alley lit by fire. The two are still standing, looking over at me, though I can’t tell who is smiling. I only know Brad Pitt winks at me while Kevin Bacon is on the street, writhing as a large white flaming couch section is smashed onto his chest.

 

My mother was dead in the dream. I was looking through a dense stash of clothes in a cabinet. All of them were soiled, and none of the clothes were hers. I remember holding a pair of purple and green Speedos that were woven to a pair of matching polyester tennis shorts. These shorts were my father’s. I remember my mother making all of his tennis shorts. I also remember pulling out a pair of long sweatpants that were much too large for my mother and holding them up as crumbs fell from the legs. I tried to smell them, wanting to think of her alive.


 


      What the brown boy doesn’t say is that he wondered, in the dream, how his father was getting through this—living alone with only her smell left behind. Or how he pulled the sweatpants up to his nose and mouth, absorbing the whole of her scent through his body. Without revealing his father’s grief or his own, the brown boy breathes in the smell of Giorgio mixed with eleven years of shifts at the convalescent home, and gives the white man what he thought he wanted. He quickly shot to the end, where Brad Pitt grinds his fat cock in the pavement, the curve of it pushing down bent and spewing semen into the street.


 

Kevin Bacon stands up and groans, laughing as his bowels leak from his stomach. I was thinking about that before you called.


 


      The brown boy knows the white man wants to hear the brown boy rise from sleep, hear the spill from his head in the morning without saying a word. Though this morning, to this dream, the white man has two responses: He calls the dream 
bizarre
 and says nothing about the brown boy’s mother, only 
I feel sorry for Brad Pitt."
1736,Chernobyl Year﻿,Jehanne Dubrow,"We dreamed of glowing children,
their throats alive and cancerous,
their eyes like lightning in the dark.

We were uneasy in our skins,
sixth grade, a year for blowing up,
for learning that nothing contains

that heat which comes from growing,
the way our parents seemed at once
both tall as cooling towers and crushed

beneath the pressure of small things—
family dinners, the evening news,
the dead voice of the dial tone.

Even the ground was ticking.
The parts that grew grew poison.
Whatever we ate became a stone.

Whatever we said was love became
plutonium, became a spark
of panic in the buried world.﻿"
1737,Food of Love,Carolyn Kizer,"Eating is touch carried to the bitter end.                                             
                                             Samuel Butler II ﻿

I’m going to murder you with love;
I’m going to suffocate you with embraces;
I’m going to hug you, bone by bone,
Till you’re dead all over.
Then I will dine on your delectable marrow.
 
You will become my personal Sahara;
I’ll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
Drain your remaining brackish well.
With my female blade I’ll carve my name
In your most aspiring palm
Before I chop it down.
Then I’ll inhale your last oasis whole.
 
But in the total desert you become
You’ll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
Opulent mirage!
Wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.
Vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.
 
So you will summon each dry grain of sand
And move toward me in undulating dunes
Till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:
A Mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;
Obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes
Your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,
Surprising life! And I will be that green.
 
When you are fed and watered, flourishing
With shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,
Till you are resurrected field in bloom,
I will devour you, my natural food,
My host, my final supper on the earth,
And you’ll begin to die again.﻿"
1738,Into These Knots,Ashley Anna McHugh,"Tell us how the soul is bound and bentinto these knots, and whether any ever
frees itself from such imprisonment.
—Canto XII, Inferno ﻿
 

I say, Without a God there is no hell.
 There’s only this—. She rustles for her keys.
The apple tree sheds petal after petal.
 
She says, Let’s take you to the hospital.
The petals spin like sparks. I close my eyes
and say, Without a God there is no hell,
 
 and there is only this. It’s just as well.
The lawn is red and white. She asks, Who says?
 How do you know? The wind fells every petal.
 
She says, Let’s take you to the hospital.
I cannot breathe. I cannot tell her, Yes—.
Because without a God there is no hell,
 
as she whispers, Talk to me, I know I will
clamber—but not toward heaven, toward the sky,
eyes winking behind petal after petal.
 
The rope-burnt bark will flake away and fall.
Knot on my neck, the rest would be so easy:
I’ll pray, Without a God there is no hell,
then slip through petals—through petal after petal."
1739,"Les É﻿ventails, Portraits of Passion",Nathalie Handal,"The shadows of birds fading on a fighter’s back
 
The undressing of words on an unstamped postcard
 
The wet swings in the distant park
 
The jealousy of raindrops on the umbrella of lovers
 
The laughter of a boy before a bird
 
The song of two flutes, two swords, two bracelets, two fingers
 
The stare of a wave before a pearl
 
The yearning between the legs of a farmer’s wife
 
The opening of doors             closing midday
 
The sudden howling of our muse—and
 
 les éventails—disturbing the guest inside of us"
1740,Love and Strange Horses—Intima’﻿,Nathalie Handal,"—
 
One hundred breaths split the air
as I lean
on the only pine tree I find.
It’s early or late, it’s breezy or hot.
The fields are dry. Summer is near.
The horses are everywhere,
strangely galloping a dream,
but I can’t remember
how to call them,
so I stand back, watch them pass.
 
 
—
 
The first time I rode a horse
my body found the music of fire,
crackling the wind. An unbearable pleasure
that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg.
 A sign, the horsekeeper told me, of longing.
 A need to return—to belong.
After all, departure is like
pushing the weight of our heart
against the village
whose name has kept us awake.
 
 
—
 
Rafael came from somewhere in Eurasia.
I passed my hands through his mane—
saw a history of conquests and battles,
a field of hay, a mount of truth,
heard a silent ring,
his eyes asking me to go with him,
to confess something sacred,
to name something lustful.
Nothing of where he came from,
or who I was, disturbed us.
 
 
—
 
I knew he was different by the way he ran—
without pause,
without grace,
without distraction,
without ease.
He was told how to move in the world
and resented it.
He knew he would never own anything.
 
 
—
 
He came toward me.
It was a quiet afternoon.
I stood unmoving.
And we listened to the untitled music
circling the earth like an anthem
free of its nation.
 
 
—
 
He was unfamiliar to me,
approaching as if he possessed the land.
Every morning he stopped five feet
from the river."
1741,Semele Recycled,Carolyn Kizer,"After you left me forever,
I was broken into pieces,
and all the pieces flung into the river.
Then the legs crawled ashore
and aimlessly wandered the dusty cow-track.
They became, for a while, a simple roadside shrine:
A tiny table set up between the thighs
held a dusty candle, weed-and-fieldflower chains
placed reverently there by children and old women.
My knees were hung with tin triangular medals
to cure all forms of hysterical disease.
 
After I died forever in the river,
my torso floated, bloated in the stream,
catching on logs or stones among the eddies.
White water foamed around it, then dislodged it;
after a whirlwind trip, it bumped ashore.
A grizzled old man who scavenged along the banks
had already rescued my arms and put them by,
knowing everything has its uses, sooner or later.
 
When he found my torso, he called it his canoe,
and, using my arms as paddles,
he rowed me up and down the scummy river.
When catfish nibbled my fingers he scooped them up
and blessed his reusable bait.
Clumsy but serviceable, that canoe!
The trail of blood that was its wake
attracted the carp and eels, and the river turtle,
easily landed, dazed by my tasty red.
 
A young lad found my head among the rushes
and placed it on a dry stone.
He carefully combed my hair with a bit of shell
and set small offerings before it
which the birds and rats obligingly stole at night,
so it seemed I ate.
And the breeze wound through my mouth and empty sockets
so my lungs would sigh, and my dead tongue mutter.
Attached to my throat like a sacred necklace
was a circlet of small snails.
Soon the villagers came to consult my oracular head
with its waterweed crown.
Seers found occupation, interpreting sighs,
and their papyrus rolls accumulated.
 
Meanwhile, young boys retrieved my eyes
they used for marbles in a simple game
till somebody’s pretty sister snatched at them
and set them, for luck, in her bridal diadem.
Poor girl! When her future groom caught sight of her,
all eyes, he crossed himself in horror,
and stumbled away in haste
through her dowered meadows.
 
What then of my heart and organs,
my sacred slit
which loved you best of all?
They were caught in a fisherman’s net
and tossed at night into a pen for swine.
But they shone so by moonlight that the sows stampeded,
trampled one another in fear, to get away.
And the fisherman’s wife, who had thirteen living children
and was contemptuous of holy love,
raked the rest of me onto the compost heap.
 
Then in their various places and helpful functions,
the altar, oracle, offal, canoe and oars
learned the wild rumor of your return.
The altar leapt up, and ran to the canoe,
scattering candle grease and wilted grasses.
Arms sprang to their sockets, blind hands with nibbled nails
groped their way, aided by loud lamentation,
to the bed of the bride, snatched up those unlucky eyes
from her discarded veil and diadem,
and rammed them home. Oh, what a bright day it was!
This empty body danced on the riverbank.
Hollow, it called and searched among the fields
for those parts that steamed and simmered in the sun,
and never would have found them.
 
But then your great voice rang out under the skies
my name!—and all those private names
for the parts and places that had loved you best.
And they stirred in their nest of hay and dung.
The distraught old ladies chasing their lost altar,
and the seers pursuing my skull, their lost employment,
and the tumbling boys, who wanted the magic marbles,
and the runaway groom, and the fisherman’s thirteen children
set up such a clamor, with their cries of “Miracle!”
that our two bodies met like a thunderclap
in midday—right at the corner of that wretched field
with its broken fenceposts and startled, skinny cattle.
We fell in a heap on the compost heap
and all our loving parts made love at once,
while the bystanders cheered and prayed and hid their eyes
and then went decently about their business.
 
And here it is, moonlight again; we’ve bathed in the river
and are sweet and wholesome once more.
We kneel side by side in the sand;
we worship each other in whispers.
But the inner parts remember fermenting hay,
the comfortable odor of dung, the animal incense,
and passion, its bloody labor,
its birth and rebirth and decay."
1742,The Unnatural Apologie of Shadows,Nathalie Handal,"We say lightning has no wings
when it slides down our houses
 
We say loss is just a condition
we acquire to bury our pity further
 
We say the bleeding hands
on the table filled with red wine
imported products and passports
are just reminders of
who we have become
 
We have no titles no birthright
no groves or Shakespeare
to return to
 
We apologize for the fear
growing out of our ribs
 
Apologize for the numbers
still etched on our tongues"
1743,The Unquarried Blue of Those Depths Is All But Blinding,Ashley Anna McHugh,"for John Fogleman

There are some things we just don’t talk about—
Not even in the morning, when we’re waking,
When your calloused fingers tentatively walk
The slope of my waist:
                                         How love’s a rust-worn boat,
Abandoned at the dock—and who could doubt
Waves lick their teeth, eyeing its hull? We’re taking
Our wreckage as a promise, so we don’t talk.
We wet the tired oars, tide drawing us out.
 
We understand there’s nothing to be said.
Both of us know the dangers of this sea,
Warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts—.
But we’ve already strayed from the harbor. We thread
A slow wake though the water—then silently,
We start to row, and will for as long as this lasts."
1744,Charley,Stephen Sandy,"Minnesota, May 1945

In Tokyo our gallant boys
dance rock-and-roll, squint eyes
wary at standing easy. They leer and reel
on a springboard tip and then
jackknife toward the electronic noise . . .
 
And Charley, when Time Inc. said he said
the President had his head
wedged about Vietnam
                   burning for honor or—who knows?
the Action he had said—
                   married the Marines.
He showered for vows on those
 
who took his word who taught him
shoot it out and shout “Yes Sir Yes Sir!”
                   and sent him out like napalm
obedient to any itchy finger.
 
I hope the fields of Minnesota gave perspective
when he moved out
                                     as to the starting line
on the command, survive, survive.

last and it
 
“after the leeches and the food”
on a break

Mouthing the big cigar
like a gangster at the wheel . . .
 
                   cigarette between thumb and finger
                   the way we all even in junior high
                   learned not to

                   that smoke:     and all was dark
                          except what sparks
                   he scattered there, stubbing it out
 
What could we do for you

your arm around the shoulder of the friend who ran faster
no more the long hours pad in hand composing
                  reasons for your belief
a belief in fathers has no reason
 
no more the simple passion of going first
your hatless straightness, the struggle, the deep worry,
                  the dark Africa of being alive in a country
                  run by chiefs without tribes
no more of all that, only your
                  brief beauty in many hearts
in a time when fathers bury their sons, and you
                  surrounded, cut down
in a war you were fated never to see,
                  blinded by love for all men."
1745,Earth Day Story,Stephen Sandy,"I remember the dusty floorboards of wood in the streetcar
Of the Minneapolis Street Railway Company
And the varnished yellow banquettes of tight-knit rattan
Worn smooth by decades of passengers
The worn gleaming brass grips at the corners of the seats
And the motorman’s little bell
Windows trembling in their casings as we crossed the avenue
Liberty dimes falling softly into the steel-rimmed hour glass
The gnarled hand of the motorman near.
My grandmother arranged herself against the seat
Her back as straight as a soldier’s beside me
Her navy hat with velvet band
And net veil down making her head seem distant,
Her dreaming smile and the patient Roman nose,
A repose so deep; from my place
I watched her when we rode like princes
Rattling past traffic stopped on the granite cobbles
Riding downtown together, my hands in hers;
All that so much
That I love yet but feel no sadness for, that
Time crossed out like the trolley tracks taken up
Or entombed under the pliant blacktop of the modernized."
1746,Gulf Memo,Stephen Sandy,"Tell me the way to the wedding
Tell me the way to the war,
Tell me the needle you’re threading
I won’t raise my voice anymore.
 
And tell me what axe you are grinding
Where the boy on the bivouac believes,
What reel you are unwinding
For the girl in her bed who grieves.
 
While behind a derrick’s girder
He watches the sinking sun,
He asks what he’ll do for murder
And what he will do for fun.
 
Will you read him the ways of war
His Miranda rights in sin,
Will you tell him what to ignore
When he studies your discipline?
 
He dozes off—but he shakes
In a dream that he is the one
Death finds abed and wakes
Just as the night is done.
 
Tell me what boats go ashore
Riding the oil-dimmed tide,
Red streamers and black in store
For the boy with a pain in his side.
 
And tell me where they are heading
Tonight; now tell me the score.
Tell me the way to their wedding
I won’t raise my own voice anymore."
1747,New England Graveyard,Stephen Sandy,"Back of the church the busy forsythias bow
and scrape to May and all these blessed stones
stiff in their careful finery of words;
the mess of markers makes me go and browse.
 
Somehow the blocks of slate and marble hate
to be cut and carved to the dimensions
of Mary Monday’s age and her virtues.
At heart they hurt to be made literate
and they are rebelling, fast as they can,
shedding an edge, a letter, as they go
—a year, a part of a skull, a bone—
it hurts them to stand so long for this
kind of death not theirs. Fast as they can
they are leaning away from their duty
and look down longing for the warm sod.
The prides and fears they stand witness to,
the ladies and gents, are only whimsy now.
They cease to reflect that wary pride
the flesh beneath them took in lying down.
To the last date line and death’s-head-stare,
the legend reads, “There! I’ve done it!”
But these are only beginning,
the blocks of shale forget their lines
letting the sunlight and rain divide
and subdivide their veins and bone.
They do not care, they only feel
an unnatural heaviness, tottering so
in the hot light. They long to be off and away,
they toss and jibe in the sun;
a whole regatta of black sails, they are sailing away
over the lumpy green yard of time, and never
coming about for home until they capsize
turned turtle by boys from Central Square.
 
Tired of holding—they are tired of holding up;
their always-leaning makes me hold my tongue
and sit with them awhile. We heave
our shoulders, or our shadows, on the mounds,
while under the hills, memorials more fine
lie lip to paper lip
                                 and keep their impossible word."
1748,"Photo of Melville; Back Room, Old Bookstore",Stephen Sandy,"I passed him by at first. From the photograph
Peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased
From a lair of brows and beard: one not amazed
At anything, as if to have looked enough
Then turned aside worked best for him—as if
Night vision was the discipline that eased
The weight of what he saw. A man’s gaze posed
Too long in the sun goes blank; comes to grief.
That face could be a focus for this back room,
For pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,
Fond notes unread: each wary eye a phial
Unstopped to let huge Melville out, to calm
The sea of pages; Melville in older age:
The grown man’s sleepy defiance of denial."
1749,Roofs,Stephen Sandy,"Sewn straw, exact pattern. Fields of rice-sprigs
evenly set, a mile of herringbone tweed.
The town, a sea of gunmetal, fish-scale tiles.
 
By morning each floor a casserole of pillows,
coverlets, comforters, towels:    flown nests. Imprint
of bodies, fading. They fold the beds away,
the room waits empty all day.
                                                       All day the bodies
circle, leaving no impression on each
other. Tooled in the foundry of the streets.
School-caps, factory-packed subway, miracle train:
one territorial imperative,
an emperor’s.
                          On his platform one yard square
perched on a roof that slopes in waves of tiles
up toward other tiled cascades, the karate student
for  hours does running in place, deep knee bends
on his surfboard perch. All his free time to make
his body efficient, tight, exact, rising
and falling, mint piston pumping in its shaft."
1750,Student Letter,Stephen Sandy,"After the declaration by emperor
to stop the war
many people in Tokyo killed themselves,
for instance, in front of the imperial palace.
But few people knows those facts.
 
Hence you must teach me
where you got the news or what sort of book
gave you the fact that quite few people knows.
To know the fact of our nation’s subjection
is not so comfortable
but the fact of many people’s spontaneous death
gives me more complicated feelings.
 
In the matter of what William Gass said
I must describe my feelings. I went
to Nagasaki
on an educational trip four years ago.
I can recollect those serious moment
which was given by the beamed materials
in the memorial hall.
 
But most youth after the war
are indifferent to those
nightmares
because of our no experience. Surely,
I think, those barbarious conducts
shouldn’t be forgiven or forgotten at all
and we must not close our eyes
to the rebombing
at any place
in this world.
 
In conclusion I may say that most people
except sufferers
or the like
will not have ill feelings toward your country
but they will reproach
the suffocative fact
in history.
 
Where were you when the World War II was over.
Please share your experience of the war with me.
I’m now interested in the wars concerned with Japan
for the past 100 years. If you tell me your reflections
I can suspect more seriously.
You have abandoned such cursed things as useless?
In that war 3 million people were killed
on the side of our nation, especially
three hundred thousand people by the A-bomb.
Over the war between the imperialism
and militarism America won a victory.
What does this word mean?"
1751,All You Did,Kay Ryan,"There doesn’t seem
to be a crack. A
higher pin cannot
be set. Nor can 
you go back. You
hadn’t even known
the face was vertical.
All you did was 
walk into a room.
The tipping up
from flat was
gradual, you
must assume."
1752,Asylum,Sasha Dugdale,"For Marina﻿

You say the old masters never got it wrong,
But when Goya painted the death of the imagination
It was a lost dog against a usurious yellow sky
And the dog, a hapless creature who had drawn itself
Ten miles on two legs, stared in amazement
To see the man who once fed him from his plate
Reduced to this.

So I felt this week, the vile soil and everything upon it—
The beggar guest kicked from the table
Before his own dog, and even the honest unpicking
Of art performed nightly and in seclusion.
Like any Penelope my armor is resignation
Although I thought I would lift the bow myself
And draw.

By the morning he is gone
And what to make of this?
The prostitutes hang from a beam like mice
The suitors are piled unburied in the yard.
And some say that it is now much better
And others, that it is worse.
So order was restored
I stared in amazement

Perhaps Akhmatova was right
When she wrote who knows what shit
What tip, what pile of waste
Brings forth the tender verse
Like hogweed, like the fat hen under the fence
Like the unbearable present tense
Who knows what ill, what strife
What crude shack of a life
And how it twists sweetly about the broken sill:
 Pressingness, another word for honeysuckle
But housewives? Has poetry
Ever deepened in the pail
Was it ever found in the sink, under the table
Did it rise in the oven, quietly able
To outhowl the hoover?
Does it press more than the children’s supper
The sudden sleepless wail?
Did it ever?
It lives. It takes seed
Like the most unforgiving weed
Grows wilder as the child grows older
And spits on dreams, did I say
How it thrives in the ashen family nest
Or how iambs are measured best
Where it hurts:
With the heel of an iron
On the reluctant breast
Of a shirt?

                               MICHAEL BLANN

There was a hush, then Michael Blann
Stepped out onto the stage. Michael
Blann, with his pipe and his jukebox head
Oh, he’s your man.

He has a song for all weathers, a pipe
And a voice, and he sings and he roams
He sings to the wind and a dog of how
The trees are all bare and Jack’s come home.

He’s a thin voice, like a spider thread
On days when the sun is late and fine
Live and let live, sings Michael Blann
The wind yields not, but the hills is mine.

He’s no call for fate passing over
His sheep are all angels, the stars are his Lords
He’ll play any part the clouds should fancy
To humble tunes and hand-me-down words

The acts are written in briar strands
And the Pharisees are leaves in the air
I likes a drop pipes Michael Blann
Sing follow hark forward the innocent hare.

He wore to his end a clutch of sheep’s wool
To show the gods that Michael Blann
Went alone, alone for most of his years
But crossed the hills a singing man."
1753,Bird Left Behind,Sophie Cabot Black,"As for her, the circumstances must be ordinary
And so the return. Door unlocked. The path mowed 
Right to the oiled gate; the pasture 

Cleared of stone and alder. All untouched
Enough to enter. The man or woman 
Off down the valley or working above

Treeline. No other sound but a few strays 
Hurrying through the dusk as if the end
Will begin, certain and with nothing

More to say. She does not know she does not know. 
Having come back to find her kind
And none being left she took herself up 

Into a tree unclear what to do next save only
Sing the song she wanted sung back to her."
1754,Dawn Chorus,Sasha Dugdale,"March 29, 2010

Every morning since the time changed
I have woken to the dawn chorus
And even before it sounded, I dreamed of it
Loud, unbelievably loud, shameless, raucous

And once I rose and twitched the curtains apart
Expecting the birds to be pressing in fright
Against the pane like passengers
But the garden was empty and it was night

Not a slither of light at the horizon
Still the birds were bawling through the mists
Terrible, invisible
A million small evangelists

How they sing: as if each had pecked up a smoldering coal
Their throats singed and swollen with song
In dissonance as befits the dark world
Where only travelers and the sleepless belong"
1755,Dominion Over the Larger Animal,Sophie Cabot Black,"How many times I have provided
For your death; the apple turned one way
Then the other, an arrangement made, 

The softer ground. To hold your head 
As if this mattered, to say what I think
Essential into your ear,

To watch the eye look everywhere to find
What it does not know it looks for.
To fasten you down in the one place

Where no one can say anything more,
Being nothing else but breath leaving,
While the man with the needle stands by

Until the signal of how it is time. To believe
I know what will happen next; to leave the hill 
As the body stiffens; to pass each blossom

Of blood in the snow as if I understood 
All I was capable of."
1756,Elk at Tomales Bay,Tess Taylor,"Nimble, preserved together, 
milkweed-white rears upturned,

female tule elk 
bowed into rustling foxtails.

Males muscled over the slopes,
jostling mantles, marking terrain. 

Their antlers clambered wide,
steep as the gorges.  

As they fed, those branches twitched,
sensory, delicate,

yet when one buck reared
squaring to look at us

his antlers and his gaze 
held suddenly motionless.

               Further out, the skeleton.

The tar paper it seemed to lie on
was hide. 

               Vertebrae like redwood stumps—
an uneven heart-shaped cavern    

               where a coccyx curled to its tip. 
Ribs fanned open

hollow, emptied of organs.
In the bushes its skull. 

Sockets and sinuses, mandible,
its few small teeth.  

All bare now except  
that fur the red-brown color 

of a young boy’s head and also 
of wild iris stalks in winter

still clung to the drying scalp. 
Below the eye’s rim sagged

               flat as a bicycle tire.

The form was sinking away.

The skin loosened, becoming other,
shedding the mask that hides

but must also reveal a creature.
Off amid cliffs and hills

some unfleshed force roamed free. 
In the wind, I felt 

the half-life I watched watch me. 
Elk, I said, I see 

               you abandon this life, this earth—

I stood for a time with the bones."
1757,Hollow Boom Soft Chime: The Thai Elephant Orchestra,Sarah Lindsay,"A sound of far-off thunder from instruments 
ten feet away: drums, a log, 
a gong of salvage metal. Chimes 
of little Issan bells, pipes in a row, sometimes 
a querulous harmonica. 
Inside the elephant orchestra’s audience, 
bubbles form, of shame and joy, and burst. 
Did elephants look so sad and wise, 
a tourist thinks, her camera cold in her pocket, 
before we came to say they look sad and wise? 
Did mastodons have merry, unwrinkled faces? 
Hollow boom soft chime, stamp of a padded foot, 
tingle of renaat, rattle of angklung. 
This music pauses sometimes, but does not end. 

Prathida gently strokes the bells with a mallet. 
Poong and his mahout regard the gong. 
Paitoon sways before two drums, 
bumping them, keeping time with her switching tail. 
Sales of recordings help pay for their thin enclosure 
of trampled grass. They have never lived free. 
Beside a dry African river 
their wild brother lies, a punctured balloon, 
torn nerves trailing from the stumps of his tusks. 
Hollow boom soft chime, scuff of a broad foot, 
sometimes, rarely, a blatting elephant voice. 
They seldom attend the instruments 
without being led to them, but, once they’ve begun, 
often refuse to stop playing."
1758,Hurt Hawks,Robinson Jeffers,"I

The broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,
The wing trails like a banner in defeat,
No more to use the sky forever but live with famine
And pain a few days: cat nor coyote
Will shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.
He stands under the oak-bush and waits
The lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom
And flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it.
He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.
The curs of the day come and torment him   
At distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head,
The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes.
The wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to those
That ask mercy, not often to the arrogant.
You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him;
Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;
Beautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.

         II

I’d sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; but the great redtail
Had nothing left but unable misery
From the bones too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons when he moved.
We had fed him for six weeks, I gave him freedom,
He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death,
Not like a beggar, still eyed with the old
Implacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was relaxed,
Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what
Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising
Before it was quite unsheathed from reality."
1759,I am,Ava Schicke,"I am a daughter and a sister.
I wonder when I will die.
I hear the warm weather coming.
I see stars in the day.
I want to learn my whole ballet dance.
I am a daughter and a sister.

I pretend to be a teacher at home.
I feel like I am a teacher.
I touch hands that are growing.
I worry that I will never change.
I cry when something or someone dies.
I am a daughter and a sister.

I understand that teachers work hard for students.
I say that I don’t like bullies.
I dream about me not moving while trying really hard to run.
I try to become a good friend.
I hope that there is no more dying or killing.
I am a daughter and a sister."
1760,The Land of Nod,James Arthur,"Growing up, I barely knew the Bible, but read
and reread the part when Cain drifted east
or was drawn that way, into a place of desolation, 
the land of Nod, there to begin, with a wife 

of unknown origin, another race of men,
under the mark of God. As a boy, I thought Nod 
would be a place where the blue scillas 
would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw, 

the serrated sword, where the very serving cups 
were bone. As a grown man, I’ve heard that Nod 
never was a nation—of Cain’s offspring, or anyone—
but a mistranslation of “wander,” so Cain 

could go wherever, and be in Nod. Far more 
than in God, I believe in Cain, who destroyed 
his own brother, and therefore in any city
could have his wish, and be alone."
1761,Linens,Kay Ryan,"There are charms
that forestall harm.
The house bristles
with opportunities
for stasis: refolding
the linens along 
their creases, keeping
the spoons and chairs

Nobody needs to
witness one’s exquisite
care with the napkins
for the napkins 
to have been the act
that made the fact
unhappen."
1762,The Obsoletion of a Language,Kay Ryan,"We knew it

sudden. Words

action of the jaws 
and mouth, unheard
by the only other
citizen there was
on earth."
1763,The One Turn That Makes the New World,Sophie Cabot Black,"Maybe the light from a small window 
Tucked at the utmost eave of the barn
Could be misunderstood; if only I had pulled  

In by the other way or not looked up
Against such darkness. The animal I brought 
Into this no longer mine, the task

Each day was to confine enough, from harm
Or from each other as night loosens
Over the assemblage. But in the pasture

One wrong step was taken. And those who remain
Are weary, heads low, torment nowhere   
To be seen, not even in the illumination

Of men who have come to help,
Who behind the double doors keep watch
By the body so it does not become

Anything for those who scavenge, to follow back
The acts of blood right up to the locked stall 
And light where each shaft lands precisely again 

Through the again. The horse was in the snow,
The rock was underfoot; all the unknowables
Made whole and apparent by one who stumbled."
1764,Our Conversation,Franz Wright,"Pure gaze, you are lightning beyond the last trees
and you are the last trees’
past, branching 
green lightning 
of terminal brain branches 
numened densely with summer’s
hunter color, as night comes on, 
the ocean they conceal
gone berserk, wind still rising.
Pure seeing, dual vortex doors 
to the blue fire where
sex is burned away, and all 
is as it was and I am being offered
in your eyes, as in cupped hands,
the water of to never thirst again.
Again I turn away, 
and the future comes, all at once 
towering around me 
on every side, and I am lost.
Pure looking, past pain 
(this is promised):
we must have wed on poverty’s most hair-raising day 
delighting, flashing risk, risk
unfailingly lighting the way, 
anything possible 
in that dissolving of seam 
between minds, 
no more golden time—
each step I took
the right step, words 
came to me finally and finding the place 
you had set for them,
once again 
wrote themselves down.
Till true word’s anvil ring, and 
solid tap of winged blind cane come,
I wish you 
all the aloneness you hunger for.
That big kitchen table where you sit laughing 
with friends, I see it happening.
And I wish that I could not be 
so much with you
when I’m suddenly not; that
inwardly you might switch 
time, to sleep
and winter while you went about 
your life, until you woke up 
well,
our conversation resumed.
Ceaseless blue lightning, this 
love passing through me: 
I know somehow it will go on
reaching you, reaching you
instantly
when I’m not in the way; 
when it is no longer deflected 
by all the dark bents, all
I tried to overcome but I could not—
so much light pulled off course 
as it passed within reach, so much
lost, lost in me, 
but no more.

1765,Pity the Beautiful,Dana Gioia,"Pity the beautiful,
the dolls, and the dishes, 
the babes with big daddies 
granting their wishes.

Pity the pretty boys, 
the hunks, and Apollos, 
the golden lads whom 
success always follows.

The hotties, the knock-outs,
the tens out of ten, 
the drop-dead gorgeous, 
the great leading men.

Pity the faded, 
the bloated, the blowsy, 
the paunchy Adonis 
whose luck’s gone lousy.

Pity the gods, 
no longer divine.
Pity the night 
the stars lose their shine."
1766,Poem Beginning with a Line by Milosz,Mark Irwin,"“The most beautiful bodies are like transparent glass.”
They are bodies of the selfless or of those newly
dead. What appears transparent is really flame
burning so brightly it appears like glass. What
you’re looking through is the act of giving: One
thing in life needed desperately, given to another,
or perhaps life itself. The most beautiful bodies
are not transparent, but sometimes the color
of lead, like the elephant whom a child with some
peanuts lifts by the trunk in his hand in the swirling
dust, so that it appears he has lifted a monument
or a city with all its pain. The bodies that seem
transparent are made of an ice so pure it appears
to be glass sweating, where you, desiring another,
glimpse your own face that weighs nothing and is burning."

Through her cotton nightie
Small, tense nipples.

O Lord, to heap
Up by still waters
Of words a cairn
But hopes to attend

Of tamarisk
Whose leaves salty
Yet feathery
Will shed light over
A thickened plot.

One wants at last
To cede the field
To tamarisk
And mastic tree,
To olive and stone,
Stones in the fruit,
Seed in the stones."

Somehow I am sturdier, more shore
than sea-spray as I thicken through
the bedroom door. I gleam of sickness.
You give me morning, Lord, as you
give earthquake to all architecture.
I can forget.
                           You put that sugar
in the melon’s breath, and it is wet
with what you are. (I, too, ferment.)
You rub the hum and simple warmth
of summer from afar into the hips
of insects and of everything.
I can forget.
                           And like the sea,
one more machine without a memory,
I don’t believe that you made me.

                          PRIME

I don’t believe that you made me
into this tremolo of hands,
this fever, this flat-footed dance
of tendons and the drapery

of skin along a skeleton.
I am that I am: a brittle
rib cage and the hummingbird
of breath that flickers in it.

Incrementally, I stand:
in me are eons and the cramp
of endless ancestry.

Sun is in the leaves again.

but then I think I see the wind."
1770,Self-Portrait after Paul Morphy’s Stroke,Josh Wild,"Paul lost his footing, turned out a spectacular corkscrew.
It looked like he was acting out a series of renga 

in the air. The general theme was prevenient grace.
But the white rim broke his form, and he hit 

the bathtub water like a big charred bough of a tree.
A semicircle of his shoes—Oxfords, monk straps,

bluchers, a lone boot—crowded in to get a look.
After that, Morphy was only surface. You can look

into anything and see what you want. For example,
Pierre swore he could read stock returns

in the little channels of Morphy’s pruned thumbs.
He even called in Schiaparelli’s niece. She entered

with a shoe on her head, I swear. There are pictures,
look it up. My uncle, my unfortunate uncle,

says the whole event—Morphy in the tub—looked
floral, with shoe petals. Just to be difficult, I said

“saucer of milk”: a teacup on a dish, alone in the
quiet, waiting for a cougar to come by. I

always bank on something parched and ambling
to make my point. Or else something with a

broken heel, covered in wet newspaper and
huddled up next to the highway. All thumbs."
1771,Special Treatments Ward,Dana Gioia,"﻿I

So this is where the children come to die,
hidden on the hospital’s highest floor.
They wear their bandages like uniforms
and pull their iv rigs along the hall 
with slow and careful steps. Or bald and pale,
they lie in bright pajamas on their beds,
watching another world on a screen.

The mothers spend their nights inside the ward,
sleeping on chairs that fold out into beds,
too small to lie in comfort. Soon they slip
beside their children, as if they might mesh
those small bruised bodies back into their flesh.
Instinctively they feel that love so strong
protects a child. Each morning proves them wrong.

No one chooses to be here. We play the parts
that we are given—horrible as they are.
We try to play them well, whatever that means.
We need to talk, though talking breaks our hearts.
The doctors come and go like oracles,
their manner cool, omniscient, and oblique.
There is a word that no one ever speaks.

                                        II

I put this poem aside twelve years ago
because I could not bear remembering 
the faces it evoked, and every line
seemed—still seems—so inadequate and grim.

What right had I, whose son had walked away, 
to speak for those who died? And I’ll admit
I wanted to forget. I’d lost one child
and couldn’t bear to watch another die.

Not just the silent boy who shared our room,
but even the bird-thin figures dimly glimpsed
shuffling deliberately, disjointedly
like ancient soldiers after a parade.

Whatever strength the task required I lacked. 
No well-stitched words could suture shut these wounds. 
And so I stopped...
But there are poems we do not choose to write.

The children visit me, not just in dream,
appearing suddenly, silently—
insistent, unprovoked, unwelcome.

They’ve taken off their milky bandages
to show the raw, red lesions they still bear.
Risen they are healed but not made whole.

A few I recognize, untouched by years.
I cannot name them—their faces pale and gray
like ashes fallen from a distant fire.

What use am I to them, almost a stranger?
I cannot wake them from their satin beds.
Why do they seek me? They never speak.

And vagrant sorrow cannot bless the dead."
1772,What Did You See?,Fanny Howe,"For Peter S.﻿

I saw the shrouds of prisoners
like baptismal gowns
buried outside the cemetery.

On the canvas frills exhaled
singed wool and cardboard.

The angels arrived as lace.

Took notes, then stuck. Awful residue
from a small cut.

                                 •

The veil has been ripped from the skin
where it was burned in.

The skin is the veil, the baby-material,
imprinted on, as if
one dropped the handkerchief
and it was one’s wrist.

The cuff is frightening.  
Stuffed onto oil.
Water-stains might fence its ghost in.

                                 ﻿•

“The barbed wire complex”
I understand.  
Winged and flattened
at the same time, poor things!

Some leftover specters of blood.

Remember Blake’s figures like columns
with heads

looking around for God?
When events are not as random
as they seem.

                                 ﻿•

The article of clothing
is only half there, it’s not full,
but when it falls forward, it is.

Terrible emptiness of the spread
neckline and little sleeve.
Half-cooked squares.

Was this religious fire
and is this where it passed?

Maybe they are floating on water
of paint, pool-sized, 
blue and ridged like foam.

You would have to fly
to see them flat as a map.

The rib and hem. Rained on
for eons. Noah’s children’s
floating forms.

                                 ﻿•

Angels die?
It’s a frightening-miracle 
because here they are.
The Upper God

has let them drop
like centuries into space.

And I recognize them!"
1773,Wichita Triptych,Stephen Yenser,"Sometimes the rain shines
Just when the sun reigns,
And that was the way it is
Beyond those French doors
That late afternoon here
In this mind’s early evening
Where they still fade in
That cool color Polaroid,
Pastel shades of her prom dress,
A bowl of double peonies,
Promising, precocious,
Trying, trying to open.

                           •

Their friend and he were tight
Tight-rope walkers, self-taught
Taut-trope-talkers, stalking
Jamb-up, arm-in-arm
And caroling to lucky stars
Their bars and rebars,
The night a carousel
Of tryst and troth, 
Of casual carousals,
Cocky arousals,
Pitching the dark to the dark.
(Streetlight and moth,
Reader, she married both.)

                           ﻿•

But then there he was,
In the morning’s mourning,
Soi-disant
Proustian mignon,
Aesthetic ascetic
And Kansas rube
Reducing his thought
To a bouillon cube
That no one hot 
Ought ever pore over."
1774,Without Warning,Sarah Lindsay,"Elizabeth Bishop leaned on a table, it cracked, 
both fell to the floor. A gesture 
gone sadly awry. This was close to fact 
and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur 
in Florida, where she was surrounded 
by rotting abundance and greedy insects. 
One moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand 
alighting on solid furniture, 
a casual shift of weight, 
the next, undignified splayed legs. 
The shell of the table 
proved to be stuffed with termite eggs. 
True, it was a fall from no great height—
merely the height of herself, 
and although the hollowed-out table failed, 
at least the floor held, 
though probably infested by termites as well, 
and possibly built on a latent sinkhole, 
how can you tell? 
And how could she, smiling and easy, 
arm moving without forethought and permission, 
have forgotten fear, apparently 
let go of a hard-learned lesson? 
Enter a room as though it is strange. 
What you recognize may have changed, 
or may change without warning. 
Trees fall in hurricanes 
and on windless mornings, 
breaching houses where people you knew 
have vanished or died or stopped loving you. 
She regained her feet, already composed, 
brushing dust from an elbow. There would be a bruise, 
but it would remind her that words are full of holes; 
flung hard, like paper they fly sideways. 
And a call to joy—a landscape, a face—
may, though scarcely moving, perhaps by not moving, go 
in one breath from heartening to ominous, 
proving to children who need more proof 
that we don’t know what we know."
1775,The woman with a tumor in her neck,Wendy Videlock,"has a moth in her palm,
a river on her tongue,
a scalpel in her boat,
a lump in her throat,
a gamble in her shoe,
a fire in her den,
a shadow in her flesh,
a flutter in her breast,
like everybody else."
1776,"Jerusalem [""And did those feet in ancient time""]",William Blake,"And did those feet in ancient time
 Walk upon Englands mountains green:
 And was the holy Lamb of God,
 On Englands pleasant pastures seen!
  
 And did the Countenance Divine,
 Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
 And was Jerusalem builded here,
 Among these dark Satanic Mills?
  
 Bring me my Bow of burning gold:
 Bring me my arrows of desire:
 Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!
 Bring me my Chariot of fire!
  
 I will not cease from Mental Fight,
 Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand:
 Till we have built Jerusalem,
 In Englands green & pleasant Land."
1777,"You Also, Nightingale",Reginald Shepherd,"Petrarch dreams of pebbles
on the tongue, he loves me
at a distance, black polished stone
skipping the lake that swallows

worn-down words, a kind of drown
and drench and quench and very kind
to what I would've said. Light marries
water and what else (unfit

for drinking purposes), light lavishes
my skin on intermittent sun. (I am weather
and unreasonable, out of all
season.  Petrarch loves my lies

of laurel leaves, ripped sprigs of
deciduous evergreen.) A creek is lying
in my cement-walled bed, slurring
through the center of small

town; the current's brown and
turbid (muddy, turbulent
with recent torrents), silt rushing
toward the reservoir. A Sonata

passes by too close (I have to jump)
and yes I do hear music here. It's blue, or
turquoise, aquamarine, some synonym
on wheels, note down that note. It's Petrarch

singing with his back to me (delivering
himself to voice), his fingers
filled with jonquil, daffodils, mistaken
narcissus. (I surprised him

between the pages of a book,
looked up the flowers I misnamed.)
Forsythia and magnolia bring me
spring, when he walks into the house

he has wings. Song is a temporary thing
(attempt), he wants to own his music."
1778,Birthday Lights,Calef Brown,"Light bulbs on a birthday cake.
What a difference that would make!
     Plug it in and make a wish,
     then relax and flip a switch!
No more smoke
      or waxy mess
      to bother any birthday guests.
But Grampa says, “it’s not the same!
      Where’s the magic?
       Where’s the flame?
To get your wish without a doubt,
You need to blow some candles out!”

1780,Earth Day,Jane Yolen,"I am the Earth
And the Earth is me.
Each blade of grass,
Each honey tree,
Each bit of mud,
And stick and stone
Is blood and muscle,
Skin and bone.

And just as I
Need every bit
Of me to make
My body fit,
So Earth needs
Grass and stone and tree
And things that grow here
Naturally.

That’s why we
Celebrate this day.
That’s why across
The world we say:
As long as life,
As dear, as free,
I am the Earth
And the Earth is me. ﻿"

 I run.
  
 I see, I sprout,
 I grow, I creep,
  
 and in the ice
 and snow, I sleep.
  
 On steppe or veld

I spread.

 of light and down I go, into the mud. Every
 year, here, I sink and settle, shuttered like a

 to its winter rhythm.  Goodbye, good-
 bye! Remember the warmth. 
 Remember the quickness.
 Remember me.

almost anything!

1792,Window Washer,Christopher Todd Matthews,"One hand slops suds on, one 
hustles them down like a blind. 
Brusque noon glare, filtered thus, 
loosens and glows. For five or 
six minutes he owns the place, 
dismal coffee bar, and us, its 
huddled underemployed. A blade, 
black line against the topmost glass, 

begins, slices off the outer lather, 
flings it away, works inward, 
corrals the frothy middle, and carves, 
with quick cuts, the stuff down, 
not looking for anything, beneath 
or inside. Homes to the last, 
cleans its edges, grooms it for 
the end, then shaves it off 

and flings it away. Which is 
splendid, and merciless. And all 
in the wrist. Then, he looks at us. 
We makers of filth, we splashers 
and spitters. We sitters and watchers. 
Who like to see him work. 
Who love it when he leaves 
and gives it back: our grim hideout, 
half spoiled by clarity."
1793,Allegory,Rafael Campo,"Outside somewhere, beneath an atmosphere
So pure and new each breath is musical
And silent, mouth-watering, without taste,
So full of butterflies one can’t imagine
Because it hurts to be so free, out there
 
There was a hospital where AIDS was cured
With Chinese cucumbers and royal jelly,
With herbal medicines, vaccines, colostrum.
I went there in a submarine, through space
It seemed, and I was armed with nuclear
 
ICBMs. I read The New York Times,
That’s how relaxed and skeptical I was;
I sat upon the floor, my back against
The gleaming missiles. Strangely , no one else
But me was on the submarine, except
 
The President, whom I’d confined beneath
The lowest deck, inside somewhere where air
Was scarce and hardly breathable. One can’t
Imagine what it’s like to see a world
Like theirs from such a distance for the first
 
Time: God, was it beautiful, butterflies
And silent musical wind, the hospital
Where no one paid. I tried to give them small
Pox, missiles, blankets; they looked at me
Like I was crazy, and they asked me why
 
The President had been incarcerated.
There’s no explaining of morality
To savages, I thought. And though it hurt
To leave, to conquer them and take with me
The royal jelly and colostrum, when I aimed
 
My missiles at their hospital I felt
Much better. Munching on a cucumber,
The light of the explosion brightening
My face, I couldn’t help the tears, I was
So sad and happy, all at once, again."
1794,Beginning with 1914,Lisel Mueller,"Since it always begins
in the unlikeliest place
we start in an obsolete country
on no current map. The camera
glides over flower beds,
for this is a southern climate.
We focus on medals, a horse,
on a white uniform,
for this is June. The young man
waves to the people lining the road,
he lifts a child, he catches
a rose from a wrinkled woman
in a blue kerchief. Then we hear shots
and close in on a casket
draped in the Austrian flag.
Thirty-one days torn off a calendar.
Bombs on Belgrade; then Europe explodes.
We watch the trenches fill with men,
the air with live ammunition.
A close-up of a five-year-old
living on turnips. Her older sister,
my not-yet-mother, already
wearing my daughter’s eyes,
is reading a letter as we cut
to a young man with thick glasses
who lies in a trench and writes
a study of Ibsen. I recognize him,
he is going to be my father,
and this is his way of keeping alive.
Snow. Blood. Lice. Frostbite.
Grenades. Stretchers. Coffins. Snow.
Telegrams with black borders.
On the wide screen my father returns
bringing his brother’s body;
my mother’s father brings back his son’s
from the opposite edge. They come together
under the oaks of the cemetery.
All who will be my family
are here, except my sister,
who is not yet imagined.
Neither am I, who imagine
this picture, who now jump
to my snowy birthday in the year
of the million-mark loaf of bread.
My early years are played
by a blue-eyed child who grows up
quickly, for this is a film
of highlights, like all documentaries
false to the life—the work
 of selective memory, all I can bear
of a painful childhood. The swastika
appears and remains as the huge
backdrop against which we’re seen.
The sound track of a hysterical voice
is threatening us. We’re heard as whispers.
Shortly before my city
bursts into flames, my stand-in
disappears from the film, which continues
with scenes of terror and death
I can’t bear to watch. I pick up
a new reel, a strange sequel
set in a different location
and made in another language,
in which I am back. The colors are bright,
the sound track is filled with music,
the focus gentle. A man is beside me.
Time-lapse photography picks up
the inchmeal growth of daughters
toward the sky, the slow subversion
of dark by gray hair. Little happens.
The camera sums up the even flow
of many years in a shot of a river.
The principals from part one
are missing, except for me
who am the connection. The time is now,
and I am playing myself."
1795,Eating Fried Chicken,Linh Dinh,"I hate to admit this, brother, but there are times
When I’m eating fried chicken
When I think about nothing else but eating fried chicken,
When I utterly forget about my family, honor and country,
The various blood debts you owe me,
My past humiliations and my future crimes—
Everything, in short, but the crispy skin on my fried chicken.
 
But I’m not altogether evil, there are also times
When I will refuse to lick or swallow anything
That’s not generally available to mankind.
 
(Which is, when you think about it, absolutely nothing at all.)
 
And no doubt that’s why apples can cause riots,
And meat brings humiliation,
And each gasp of air
Will fill one’s lungs with gun powder and smoke."
1796,Lonely Eagles,Marilyn Nelson,"for Daniel “Chappie” James, General USAF            
and for the 332d Fighter Group

Being black in America
was the Original Catch,
so no one was surprised
by 22:
The segregated airstrips,
separate camps.
They did the jobs
they’d been trained to do.
 
Black ground crews kept them in the air;
black flight surgeons kept them alive;
the whole Group removed their headgear
when another pilot died.
 
They were known by their names:
“Ace” and “Lucky,”
“Sky-hawk Johnny,” “Mr. Death.”
And by their positions and planes.
 Red Leader to Yellow Wing-man,
 do you copy?
 
If you could find a fresh egg
you bought it and hid it
in your dopp-kit or your boot
until you could eat it alone.
On the night before a mission
you gave a buddy
your hiding-places
as solemnly
as a man dictating
his will.
 There’s a chocolate bar
 in my Bible;
 my whiskey bottle
 is inside my bedroll.
 
In beat-up Flying Tigers
that had seen action in Burma,
they shot down three German jets.
They were the only outfit
in the American Air Corps
to sink a destroyer
with fighter planes.
Fighter planes with names
like “By Request.”
Sometimes the radios
didn’t even work.
 
They called themselves
“Hell from Heaven.”
This Spookwaffe.
My father’s old friends.
 
It was always
maximum effort:
A whole squadron
of brother-men
raced across the tarmac
and mounted their planes.
 
            My tent-mate was a guy named Starks.
            The funny thing about me and Starks
            was that my air mattress leaked,
            and Starks’ didn’t.
            Every time we went up,
            I gave my mattress to Starks
            and put his on my cot.
 
            One day we were strafing a train.
            Strafing’s bad news:
            you have to fly so low and slow
            you’re a pretty clear target.
            My other wing-man and I
            exhausted our ammunition and got out.
            I recognized Starks
            by his red tail
            and his rudder’s trim-tabs.
            He couldn’t pull up his nose.
            He dived into the train
            and bought the farm.
 
            I found his chocolate,
            three eggs, and a full fifth
            of his hoarded-up whiskey.
            I used his mattress
            for the rest of my tour.
 
            It still bothers me, sometimes:
            I was sleeping
            on his breath."
1797,The Lonesome Dream,Lisel Mueller,"In the America of the dream
the first rise of the moon
swings free of the ocean,
and she reigns in her shining flesh
over a good, great valley
of plumped, untrampled grasses
and beasts with solemn eyes,
of lovers infallibly pitched
in their ascendant phase.
 
In this America, death
is virginal also, roaming
the good, great valley
in his huge boots, his shadow
steady and lean, his pistol
silver, his greeting clear
and courteous as a stranger’s
who looks for another, a mind
to share his peaceable evenings.
 
Dreaming, we are another
race than the one which wakes
in the cold sweat of fear,
fires wild shots at death.,
builds slippery towers of glass
to head him off, waylays him
with alcohol traps, rides him down
in canyons of sex, and hides
in teetering ghost towns.
 
Dreaming, we are the mad
who swear by the blood of trees
and speak with the tongues of streams
through props of steel and sawdust,
a colony of souls
ravaged by visions, bound
to some wild, secret cove
not yet possessed, a place
still innocent of us."
1798,Palindrome,Lisel Mueller,"There is less difficulty—indeed, no logical difficulty at all—in
imagining two portions of the universe, say two galaxies, in which
time goes one way in one galaxy and the opposite way in the
other. . . . Intelligent beings in each galaxy would regard their own
time as “forward” and time in the other galaxy as “backward.”

Somewhere now she takes off the dress I am
putting on. It is evening in the antiworld
where she lives. She is forty-five years away
from her death, the hole which spit her out
into pain, impossible at first, later easing,
going, gone. She has unlearned much by now.
Her skin is firming, her memory sharpens,
her hair has grown glossy. She sees without glasses,
she falls in love easily. Her husband has lost his
shuffle, they laugh together. Their money shrinks,
but their ardor increases. Soon her second child
will be young enough to fight its way into her
body and change its life to monkey to frog to
tadpole to cluster of cells to tiny island to
nothing. She is making a list:
            Things I will need in the past
                        lipstick
                        shampoo
                        transistor radio
                        Sergeant Pepper
                        acne cream
                        five-year diary with a lock
She is eager, having heard about adolescent love
and the freedom of children. She wants to read
 Crime and Punishment and ride on a roller coaster
without getting sick. I think of her as she will
be at fifteen, awkward, too serious. In the
mirror I see she uses her left hand to write,
her other to open a jar. By now our lives should
have crossed. Somewhere sometime we must have
passed one another like going and coming trains,
with both of us looking the other way."
1799,Romantics,Lisel Mueller,"Johannes Brahms and                                 
        Clara Schumann

The modern biographers worry
“how far it went,” their tender friendship.
They wonder just what it means
when he writes he thinks of her constantly,
his guardian angel, beloved friend.
The modern biographers ask
the rude, irrelevant question
of our age, as if the event
of two bodies meshing together
establishes the degree of love,
forgetting how softly Eros walked
in the nineteenth-century, how a hand
held overlong or a gaze anchored
in someone’s eyes could unseat a heart,
and nuances of address not known
in our egalitarian language
could make the redolent air
tremble and shimmer with the heat
of possibility. Each time I hear
the Intermezzi, sad
and lavish in their tenderness,
I imagine the two of them
sitting in a garden
among late-blooming roses
and dark cascades of leaves,
letting the landscape speak for them,
leaving us nothing to overhear."
1800,Virtuosi,Lisel Mueller,"In memory of my parents 

People whose lives have been shaped
by history—and it is always tragic—
do not want to talk about it,
would rather dance, give parties
on thrift-shop china. You feel
wonderful in their homes,
two leaky rooms, nests
they stowed inside their hearts
on the road into exile.
They know how to fix potato peelings
and apple cores so you smack your lips.
 
The words start over again
hold no terror for them.
Obediently they rise
and go with only a rucksack
or tote bag. If they weep,
it’s when you’re not looking.
 
To tame their nightmares, they choose
the most dazzling occupations,
swallow the flames in the sunset sky,
jump through burning hoops
in their elegant tiger suits.
Cover your eyes: there’s one
walking on a thread
thirty feet above us—
shivering points of light
leap across her body,
and she works without a net."
1801,The Honey Bear,Eileen Myles,"Billie Holiday was on the radio
I was standing in the kitchen
smoking my cigarette of this
pack I plan to finish tonight
last night of smoking youth.
I made a cup of this funny
kind of tea I’ve had hanging
around. A little too sweet
an odd mix. My only impulse
was to make it sweeter.
Ivy Anderson was singing
pretty late tonight
in my very bright kitchen.
I’m standing by the tub
feeling a little older
nearly thirty in my very
bright kitchen tonight.
I’m not a bad looking woman
I suppose     O it’s very quiet
in my kitchen tonight        I’m squeezing
this plastic honey bear      a noodle
of honey dripping into the odd sweet
tea. It’s pretty late
Honey bear’s cover was loose
and somehow honey      dripping down
the bear’s face   catching
in the crevices beneath
the bear’s eyes    O very sad and sweet
I’m standing in my kitchen     O honey
I’m staring at the honey bear’s face."
1802,Peanut Butter,Eileen Myles,"I am always hungry
& wanting to have
sex. This is a fact.
If you get right
down to it the new
unprocessed peanut
butter is no damn
good & you should
buy it in a jar as
always in the
largest supermarket
you know. And
I am an enemy
of change, as
you know. All
the things I
embrace as new
are in
fact old things,
re-released: swimming,
the sensation of
being dirty in
body and mind
summer as a
time to do
nothing and make
no money. Prayer
as a last re-
sort. Pleasure
as a means,
and then a
means again
with no ends
in sight. I am
absolutely in opposition
to all kinds of
goals. I have
no desire to know           
where this, anything
is getting me.
When the water
boils I get
a cup of tea.
Accidentally I
read all the
works of Proust.
It was summer
I was there
so was he. I
write because
I would like
to be used for
years after
my death. Not
only my body
will be compost
but the thoughts
I left during
my life. During
my life I was
a woman with
hazel eyes. Out
the window
is a crooked
silo. Parts
of your
body I think
of as stripes
which I have
learned to
love along. We
swim naked
in ponds &
I write be-
hind your
back. My thoughts
about you are
not exactly
forbidden, but
exalted because
they are useless,
not intended
to get you
because I have
you & you love
me. It’s more
like a playground
where I play
with my reflection
of you until
you come back
and into the
real you I
get to sink
my teeth. With
you I know how
to relax. &
so I work
behind your
back. Which
is lovely.
Nature
is out of control
you tell me &
that’s what’s so
good about
it. I’m immoderately
in love with you,
knocked out by
all your new
white hair
 
why shouldn’t
something
I have always
known be the
very best there
is. I love
you from my
childhood,
starting back
there when
one day was
just like the
rest, random
growth and
breezes, constant
love, a sand-
wich in the
middle of
day,
a tiny step
in the vastly
conventional
path of
the Sun. I
squint. I
wink. I
take the
ride."
1803,Snakes,Eileen Myles,"for Kathe Izzo

I was 6 and
I lost my snake.
 
The table shook
I can do better
than this
and shambled
to the kitchen
to the scene
of the crime
 
I was green
I put my sneaker
down, little shoe
 
I felt the cold
metal tap
my calf
 
moo and everything
began to change.
I am 6
turned into lightning
wrote on the night
 
At 6, I was feathers
scales, I fell into
the slime of it, lit
 
You think you are six,
it yelled. I am face
to face with a frog
a woman alone
in bed. The square
of the window
persists. I am 6.
 
The phone rings
It’s my sister
blamm I dropped
a plate. Sorry.
 
Now the clouds slide           
by afraid, awake
my feet are cold
but I’m fearless
 
I am 6.
 
Under here
with bottle caps
and stars
adults and low
moans, busses
 
slamming on brakes
I am 6
 
the cake is lit
it’s round
the children
sing. I will never
return. We are
so small.
 
My husband turns
his fevered
face. I put
the medicine
down. Click.
I am 6.
 
The movie rolls on.
Tramping feet,
music blaring
at the end of
the war. I
am frightened
hold my hand
 
The round face
of the woman
upstairs, moving
the faucets, strips
of vegetable
 
slithering down,
her reptile child
will never
return. The telephone
 rings. It’s me.
I’m six."

      This is a slight stiff dance to a waking baby whose arms have been lying curled back above his head upon the pillow, making a flower—the eyes closed. Dead to the world! Waking is a little hand brushing away dreams. Eyes open. Here’﻿﻿﻿s a new world.

     Security, solidity—we laugh at them in our clique. It is tobacco to us, this side of her leg. We put it in our samovar and make tea of it. You see the stuff has possibilities. You think you are opposing the rich but the truth is you’﻿﻿﻿re turning toward authority yourself, to say nothing of religion. No, I do not say it means nothing. Why everything is nicely adjusted to our moods. But I would rather describe to you what I saw in the kitchen last night—overlook the girl a moment: there over the sink (1) this saucepan holds all, (2) this colander holds most, (3) this wire sieve lets most go and (4) this funnel holds nothing. You appreciate the progression. What need then to be always laughing? Quit phrase making—that is, not of course—but you will understand me or if not—why—come to breakfast sometime around evening on the fourth of January any year you please; always be punctual where eating is concerned.

     My little son’﻿﻿﻿s improvisations exceed min: a round stone
 to him’﻿﻿﻿s a loaf of bread or “this hen could lay a dozen
 golden eggs.” Birds fly about his bedstead; giants lean over
 him with hungry jaws; bears roam the farm by summer
 and are killed and quartered at a thought. There are in
terminable stories at eating time full of bizarre imagery,
 true grotesques, pigs that change to dogs in the telling,
 cows that sing, roosters that become mountains and oceans
 that fill a soup plate. There are groans and growls, dun
 clouds and sunshine mixed in a huge phantasmagoria that
 never rests, never ceased to unfold into—the day’﻿﻿﻿s poor
 little happenings. Not that alone. He has music which I
 have not. His tunes follow no scale, no rhythm—alone the
 mood in odd ramblings up and down, over and over with
 a rigor of invention that rises beyond the power to follow
 except in some more obvious flight. Never have I heard so 
crushing a critique as those desolate inventions, involved
 half-hymns, after his first visit to a Christian Sunday school.

      This particular thing, whether it be four pinches of four divers white powders cleverly compounded to cure surely, safely, pleasantly a painful twitching of the eyelids or say a pencil sharpened at one end, dwarfs the imagination, makes logic a butterfly, offers a finality that sends us spinning through space, a fixity the mind could climb forever, a revolving mountain, a complexity with a surface of glass; the gist of poetry. D.C.

      There is no thing that with a twist of the imagination cannot be something else. Porpoises risen in a green sea, the wind at nightfall bending the rose-red grasses and you—in your apron running to catch—say it seems to you to be your son. How ridiculous! You will pass up into a cloud and look back at me, not count the scribbling foolish that puts wings to your heels, at your knees.

      Sooner or later as with the leaves forgotten the swinging branch long since and summer: they scurry before a wind on the frost-baked ground—have no place to rest—somehow invoke a burst of warm days not of the past nothing decayed: crisp summer!—neither a copse for resurrected frost eaters but a summer removed   undestroyed a summer of dried leaves scurrying with a screech, to and fro in the half dark—twittering, chattering, scraping. Hagh!

  

________________

 

     Seeing the leaves dropping from the high and low branches the thought rise: this day of all others is the one chosen, all other days fall away from it on either side and only itself remains in perfect fullness. It is its own summer, of its leaves as they scrape on the smooth ground it must build its perfection. The gross summer of the year is only a halting counterpart of those fiery days of secret triumph which in reality themselves paint the year as if upon a parchment, giving each season a mockery of the warmth or frozenness which is within ourselves. The true seasons blossom or wilt not in fixed order but so that many of them may pass in a few weeks or hours whereas sometimes a whole life passes and the season remains of a piece from one end to the other.

And goes is gone
cause for mourning head
in hands in tears gonna be a long long wait for the resurrection
of the dead.
 
There are birds there is birdsong
unmourning and unmournful at sunrise in the white light
there is a garden with high walls around it
jardin de plaisir
of mint and lavender of hyssop in hedges glassy beads of water on velvet leaves
purple-flaked lupin spikes above velvet pulmonaria
there is a gardener la belle jardinière bare-breasted and bare-footed
bouquets
of all flowers in her arms and woven in her hair.
 
     2
And it hurts not good but
bad
to see a man head in hands in tears it breaks you up
to see a man come down in tears.
 
There are birds there is birdsong
having come through hunger and danger
there is free song
a free weaving of many songs
song against song and other songs clustered/spun out in a blending of wavy pitches
tant
doucement the phrase means what the songs mean
freshness
that meaning so sweetly and freely as a gardener weaves flowers in her hair.
 
     3
Can we stay in the weave of
that meaning can we/should we attempt to stay to linger
in a pleasure garden everlasting dream of
love tomorrow its unseen/secret structure when our time remains a
bad time and what time wasn’﻿﻿t
bad
wasn’﻿﻿t and isn’﻿﻿t a time of hunger and danger of young men and older men
in tears our time a time
of terror and counterterror can
we/should
we our
time remaining a really bad time a really down and dirty time
of terror what
walls do not fall and who says they have no fear.
 
     4
And boo-hoo-hoo
like dolls
hurts breaks you up like dolls get broken the visible human
the visibly spastic plastic.
 
There are birds there is birdsong
unmourning and unmournful having come through
there is a garden with swept gravel paths
dream designed/bel et bon designed connecting and interconnecting
non brisé﻿
where men and women are in contemplation in conversation in
one another’﻿﻿s eyes
there is a gardener holding her bouquets and holding her skirts like the light like
so sweetly woven song like love never for sale."

Here, shooting stars linger
They give out
A sparkling trail like a cauterized incision
 
Silver, or amber
If the moon is low and rising red

Can rupture a spleen
Or oust a kidney stone
 
As for the heart
It needs a beginning
The narrative
Burden of events

One of the drivers ran over the neighbor’﻿s ducks
The neighbor demanded compensation
For the post-traumatic stress disorder he accurately anticipates
 
Do you know what it’﻿s like
To drive on roads occupied
By animal farms: you cannot tell
Who killed who or how
Many ducks were there to begin with

In the morning, elephant grass moves the way
Mist is visible in the breeze but doesn’﻿t dampen the skin

Today, I yelled at three old women
Who wouldn’﻿t stop bargaining for pills they didn’﻿t need
One wanted extra
For her grandson who came along for the ride
 
 
9.
Like lip sores
The asphalt blisters in the rain
 
And the boys
Fill the holes with dirt and gravel
And broken green branches
Then wait:
 
No windex. No flowers or newspapers
And gratuity is appreciated
 
 
10.
“I have ants in my leg”
And “My leg went to sleep”
Are not the same thing!
 
The French argue
There is no sleep in a tingling numbness
The symptom of sluggish blood:
 
I agree. Me too my leg has been anted
And we are learning to reconcile
The dark with the electric
 
 
11.
Four days the river runs to the border
Nine days to learn it wasn’﻿t the shape
Of your nose that gave you away
And debts are paid off in a-shelter-for-a-day
 
A pile of wood plus change in your pocket
Is a sack of potatoes and change in another’﻿s
 
 
12.
No more running long or short distance
The old women
Snicker at me when I pass them by
 
 
13.
She was comatose post-partum
And the beekeeper
Bathed her in love everyday
 
When she recovered I gave up
What he’﻿d promised me for the woman
Who took up nursing their newborn
Since as coincidence would have it
Her name was Om Assel — Mother of Honey
 
 
14.
The translation of a medical interview
Is not a poem to be written
 
Come recite a verse from childhood with me
 I see you’﻿re unable to weep, does love
 Have no command over you?
  
 The sea’﻿s like the desert
 Neither quenches the thirst
 
 
15.
Here, dry grass burns the moon
Here, a clearing of grass is a clearing of snakes
 
 
16.
And the rain has already been cleansed from the sky
The clinic is empty, soon
The earth will unseal like a jar
Harvest is the season that fills the belly
 
 
17.
Here, I ride my bicycle invisible
Except for a crescent shadow and the Milky Way
Is already past
 
 
18.
And a mirror gives the moon back to the moon
Home is an epilogue:
 
Which came first
Memory or words?"
1810,Nocturnal Admissions,Chip Livingston,"I went to my mother’s room at 13
past midnight, and told her I was dying.
I’d wet the bed, I’d had this crazy dream,
about a sexy neighbor I’d been spying
on. Well, I didn’t tell her that. I mean,
the day before she asked who I was eyeing
when I didn’t want to go outside
for ice cream. The truck was parked out front,
and she was buying, but I couldn’t join
the other screaming kids —
not with Lance applying suntan lotion
to his muscled teenage skin.
Stretched out on a beach towel
in his front yard, his body mystified me,
while mine seemed happy to defy me.
My dick would tent my cut-offs
at the sight of him.
I wore two pair of underwear,
but even then I thought I’d burst
right through the seams.
So I didn’t dare tell mother what I’d dreamed,
though she did think to ask me.
I’d have been a fool to tell her that.
She thought my blush was any boy’s,
puzzling out his sexuality, but I swear it was
as much because the fantasies
were always other boys.
some from my baseball team,
some the roughnecks at school,
but usually Lance. He was flying
naked in the dream I had that night,
the one that made me think that God
was mad and killing me. I was lying
(also naked — and hard as cinder block)
on the beach towel I’d seen him lay
across the grass the day before.
I tried to understand the signs implying
I might turn into some kind of freaky thing.
But it would have been cruel to tell my mother that,
especially when she was already crying,
and trying not to laugh at the same time,
when I showed her what came out of me.
She apologized for throwing such a scene,
said I was growing up to be a man, that’s all it meant,
said it was normal for a boy my age’s thing
to start uprising like a metal beam.
She apologized again
that I didn’t have my dad around to train
an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty.
I was as stupefied as I’ve ever been.
She never mentioned him.
And I have never turned a deeper red
than I did then, at 26 past midnight,
when my mother helped me change my sheets,
and said the next day she’d teach me to wash them.
And then she said she’d ask the man across the street
to talk to me. Would that be okay?
Or would I feel more comfortable
with someone younger, like his son?"

It wasn’﻿t over a woman that war began, but it’﻿s better
To see it this way, my myth professor loved to say, a man
From the South rumored to extort the bodies of college girls
Into higher grades. My girlfriend of the time told me so —
 
He was a creep, she
Got an A in the class and liked his joke about religion
As self-mutilation, it was Ramadan then and, O Helen,
I was fasting. I lie awake in a desert night east
 
Of the Atlantic on the verge of rain, the catapulted grains
Of sand on hot zinc roof, the rustle of leaves, the flap
Of peeling bark on trees whose names I do not know, and where
Would I find a botany guide here. Water flowed
 
Like a river from the Jabal once.
There were elephant pools, alligator
Streams, and a pond for the devil to speak in human tongues.
All desiccant names now after an earthquake
 
Shuffled the ground decades ago. It will rain soon,
I’﻿m assured, since nothing has stopped
The birds from migration. All the look-alikes
Are already here: the stork, the heron.
 
The white flying flowers, the ibis, and the one
That aesthetizes you more."
1813,Scarecrow,Fady Joudah,"The rice field birds are too clever for scarecrows,
They know what they love, milk in the grain.
 
When it happens, there will be no time to look for anyone.
Husband, children, nine brothers and sisters.
 
You will drop your sugarcane-stick-beating of plastic bucket,
Stop shouting at birds and run.
 
They will load you in trucks and herd you for a hundred miles.
Old men will teach you trade with soldiers at checkpoints.
 
You will give them your spoon, blanket and beans,
They’﻿﻿﻿﻿ll let you keep your life. And if you jump off the truck,
 
The army jeep trailing it will run you over.
Later, they will accuse you of giving up your land.
 
Later, you will stand in distribution lines and won’﻿﻿﻿t receive enough to eat.
Your mother will weave you new underwear from flour sacks.
 
And they’﻿﻿﻿ll give you plastic tents, cooking pots,
Vaccine cards, white pills, and wool blankets.
 
And you will keep your cool.
Standing with eyes shut tight like you’﻿﻿﻿ve got soap in them.
 
Arms stretched wide like you’﻿﻿﻿re catching rain."
1814,Sleeping Trees,Fady Joudah,"Between what should and what should not be
Everything is liable to explode. Many times
I was told who has no land has no sea. My father
Learned to fly in a dream. This is the story
Of a sycamore tree he used to climb
When he was young to watch the rain.
 
Sometimes it rained so hard it hurt. Like being
Beaten with sticks. Then the mud would run red.
 
My brother believed bad dreams could kill
A man in his sleep, he insisted
We wake my father from his muffled screams
On the night of the day he took us to see his village.
No longer his village he found his tree amputated.
Between one falling and the next
 
There’﻿s a weightless state. There was a woman
Who loved me. Asked me how to say tree
In Arabic. I didn’﻿t tell her. She was sad. I didn’﻿t understand.
When she left. I saw a man in my sleep three times. A man I knew
Could turn anyone into one-half reptile.
I was immune. I thought I was. I was terrified of being
 
The only one left. When we woke my father
He was running away from soldiers. Now
He doesn’﻿t remember that night. He laughs
About another sleep, he raised his arms to strike a king
And tried not to stop. He flew
But mother woke him and held him for an hour,
 
Or half an hour, or as long as it takes a migration inward.
Maybe if I had just said it.
 Shejerah, she would’﻿ve remembered me longer. Maybe
I don’﻿t know much about dreams
But my mother taught me the law of omen. The dead
Know about the dying and sometimes
Catch them in sleep like the sycamore tree
My father used to climb
 
When he was young to watch the rain stream,
And he would gently swing."
1815,The Tea and Sage Poem,Fady Joudah,"At a desk made of glass,
In a glass walled-room
With red airport carpet,
 
An officer asked
My father for fingerprints,
And my father refused,
 
So another offered him tea
And he sipped it. The teacup
Template for fingerprints.
 
My father says, it was just
Hot water with a bag.
My father says, in his country,
 
Because the earth knows
The scent of history,
It gave the people sage.
 
I like my tea with sage
From my mother’﻿s garden,
Next to the snapdragons
 
She calls fishmouths
Coming out for air. A remedy
For stomach pains she keeps
 
In the kitchen where
She always sings.
First, she is Hagar
 
Boiling water
Where tea is loosened.
Then she drops
 
In it a pinch of sage
And lets it sit a while.
She tells a story:
 
The groom arrives late
To his wedding
Wearing only one shoe.
 
The bride asks him
About the shoe. He tells her
He lost it while jumping
 
Over a house-wall.
Breaking away from soldiers.
She asks:
 
Tea with sage
Or tea with mint?
 
With sage, he says,
Sweet scent, bitter tongue.
She makes it, he drinks."
1816,Winter,Timothy Liu,"How long will the bed that we made together
hold us there? ﻿Your stubbled cheeks grazed my skin﻿
from evening to dawn, a cloud of scattered
particles now, islands of shaving foam
slowly spiraling down the drain, blood drops
stippling the water pink as I kiss
the back of your neck, our faces framed inside
a medicine cabinet mirror. The blade
of your hand carves a portal out of steam,
the two of us like boys behind frosted glass
who wave goodbye while a car shoves off
into winter. All that went unnoticed
till now — empty cups of coffee stacked up
in the sink, the neighborhood kids
up to their necks in mounds of autumn leaves.
How months on a kitchen calendar drop
like frozen flies, the flu season at its peak
followed by a train of magic-markered
xxx’﻿﻿﻿s — nights we’﻿﻿﻿d spend apart. Death must work
that way, a string of long distance calls
that only gets through to the sound of your voice
on our machine, my heart’﻿﻿﻿s mute confession
screened out. How long before we turn away
from flowers altogether, your blind hand
reaching past our bedridden shoulders
to hit that digital alarm at delayed
intervals — till you shut it off completely."
1817,End of Market Day,Judith Harris,"At five, the market is closing. 
Burdock roots, parsley, and rutabagas 
are poured back into the trucks. 
The antique dealer breaks down his tables. 

Light dappled, in winter parkas 
shoppers hunt for bargains: 
a teapot, or costume jewelry, 
a grab bag of rubbishy vegetables for stew. 

Now twilight, the farmer’s wife 
bundled in her tweed coat and pocket apron 
counts out her cash from a metal box, 
and nods to her grown-up son 

back from a tour in Iraq, 
as he waits in the station wagon 
with the country music turned way up, 
his prosthetic leg gunning the engine."
1818,Exercise 8 (12/4/00 AM),Catherine Wagner,"Raise up your back like an insect on the face of the nation
He took Miss Mousie on his knee, O say
little mouse will you marry me?
Getting hair cut this morning illegally
I can’﻿t afford it
Fourteen fifteen I depend on you and roiling unlap this morn
The mind refrigerated all night
Now to clarify the broth skim off the oil & swallow it is your oil
I must have it shorter so it grows longer in unison
A glory and stern grandeur, which men silently gazed on with wonder
    and tears"
1819,Gallimaufry,Ange Mlinko,"Reaching for the vinegar over the range hood 
(still dashing grass wisps on the gas flames 
from the exhaust vent where we booted 
                     that brooding sparrow) 

I remember the rabbit in the Tiergarten 
that perched on its spatula feet where the grass 
had just started to green. The German clouds 
                     were unibrow. 

It's not the stretching, slightly weaving, that recalls it, 
it's the tang of vinegar, Easter egg dye solvent. 
And my gallimaufry gets going, guests for dinner, 
                     the requisite foofaraw. 

In the soffits of the staircase a rag and a featherduster.

1820,Hunting the Cotaco Creek,Charles Ghigna,"His hand in hold so trigger-tight its blood
believes in ghosts. It clings with finger set
on steel and waits inside a dream of ducks.
The twilight burns into a rising arc
of eastern sky as sun reveals herself
too proud and instantly receives full-face
a splash of mallard flock. A shotgun blasts
the yellow into streaming pinks and gives
the creek its new-day taste of echoed blood.
Two green head ghosts fly through the pulse of dawn
upon a trigger’﻿s touch. The creek empties
of sound. In silence human fingers find
wet feet of web and carry in each hand
a bird whose only cry comes in color."
1821,A Hymn for Berryman,Charles Ghigna,"You marched into the gray eyes of dawn
feeling older than the bones
that held their ground
like grazing, aged cattle
waiting, eyes closed to the wind,
on a winter, slaughter morning.
You searched through the fog for a sign,
but there was no sun to burn the way,
no burst of rainbow bridge
to keep you from the cattle call."

and paid for the house. I felt
house on my heel then instep and toe.
I had a bad foot and I paid
to get it fixed so I could walk here.
I paid for the house and I paid for the
foot that touches it. I paid to be
directed rectangularly and down a hall.
I curved my body to direct
my waste through a hole. I am helped
and paying for it.
 
all of me exchanged,
housing exchange.
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                   I saw us standing
   up in the world.
And we sank into

      Why go further? One might conceivably rectify the rhythm, study all out and arrive at the perfection of a tiger lily or a china doorknob. One might lift all out of the ruck, be a worthy successor to—the man in the moon. Instead of breaking the back of a willing phrase why not  try to follow the wheel through—approach death at a walk, take in all the scenery. There﻿’﻿s as much reason one way as the other and then—one never knows—perhaps we’﻿ll bring back Eurydice—this time!

     Between two contending forces there may at all time
s arrive that moment when the stress is equal on both sides
 so that with a great pushing a great stability results giving
 a picture of perfect rest. And so it may be that once upon
 the way the end drives back upon the beginning and a stop
page will occur. At such a time the poet shrinks from the
 doom that is calling him forgetting the delicate rhythms of
 perfect beauty, preferring in his mind the gross buffetings
 of good and evil fortune.

Ay dio! 
I would say so much were it not for the tunes changing, changing, darting so many ways. One step and the cart’﻿s left you sprawling. Here’﻿s the way! and—you’﻿re hip bogged. And there’﻿s blame of the light too: when eyes are humming birds who’﻿ll tie them with a lead string? But it’﻿s the tunes they want most,—send them skipping out at the tree tops. Whistle then! who’﻿d stop the leaves swarming; curving down the east in their braided jackets? Well enough—but there’﻿s small comfort in naked branches when the heart’﻿s not set that way.

________________  

     A man’﻿s desire is to win his way to some hilltop. But 
against him seem to swarm a hundred jumping devils. These 
are his constant companions, these are the friendly images
 which he has invented out of his mind and which are in
viting him to rest and to disport himself according to hidden
 reasons. The man being half a poet is cast down and longs
 to rid himself of his torment and his tormentors.

      When you hang your clothes on the line you do not expect to see the line broken and them trailing in the mud. Nor would you expect to keep your hands clean by putting them in a dirty pocket. However and of course if you are a market man, fish, cheeses and the like going under your fingers every minute in the hour you would not leave off the business and expect to handle a basket of fine laces without at least mopping yourself on a towel, soiled as it may be. Then how will you expect a fine trickle of words to follow you through the intimacies of this dance without—oh, come let us walk together into the air awhile first. One must be watchman to much secret arrogance before his ways are tuned to these measures. You see there is a dip of the ground between us. You think you can leap up from your gross caresses of these creatures and at a gesture fling it all off and step out in silver to my finger tips. Ah, it is not that I do not wait for you, always! But my sweet fellow—you have broken yourself without purpose, you are—Hark! it is the music! Whence does it come? What! Out of the ground? Is it this that you have been preparing for me? Ha, goodbye, I have a rendezvous in the tips of three birch sisters. 
Encouragez vos musiciens!
 Ask them to play faster. I will return—later. Ah you are kind.—and I? must dance with the wind, make my own snow flakes, whistle a contrapuntal melody to my own fugue! Huzza then, this is the dance of the blue moss bank! Huzza then, this is the mazurka of the hollow log! Huzza then, this is the dance of rain in the cold trees."

1825,Orange Berries Dark Green Leaves,John Taggart,"Darkened not completely dark let us walk in the darkened field
trees in the field outlined against that which is less dark
under the trees are bushes with orange berries dark green leaves
not poetry’﻿﻿s mixing of yellow light blue sky darker than that
darkness of the leaves a modulation of the accumulated darkness
orange of the berries another modulation spreading out toward us
it is like the reverberation of a bell rung three times
like the call of a voice the call of a voice that is not there.
 
We will not look up how they got their name in a book of names
we will not trace the name’﻿﻿s root conjecture its first murmuring

1826,Poem for Haruko,June Jordan,"I never thought I’d keep a record of my pain
or happiness
like candles lighting the entire soft lace
of the air
around the full length of your hair/a shower
organized by God
in brown and auburn
undulations luminous like particles
of flame
 
But now I do
retrieve an afternoon of apricots
and water interspersed with cigarettes
and sand and rocks
we walked across:
                        How easily you held
my hand
beside the low tide
of the world
 
Now I do
relive an evening of retreat
a bridge I left behind
where all the solid heat
of lust and tender trembling
lay as cruel and as kind
as passion spins its infinite
tergiversations in between the bitter
and the sweet
 
Alone and longing for you
now I do"
1828,Pride Diary,Jenny Factor,"1

Who knew it’﻿﻿﻿s quite all right that I downed three
gin-and-tonics (can’﻿﻿﻿t fit male inside
female part on fanny pack) at four
o’﻿﻿﻿clock the Dyke March day of NY Pride?
Who knew Manhattan streets would liquefy
and lurch with dames sans bras, sans hair, sans shirt
in step with beer-can band led by a skirt-
ed trans in green brassiere, led by the cops
whose sentries are staid as posts with glasses on,
lined up beside the march like S/M tops?
(They seem to think Gay Pride’﻿﻿﻿s this weekend’﻿﻿﻿s yawn.)
(Pit stop at McD’﻿﻿﻿s, can’﻿﻿﻿t clip pack back on.)
Who knew she’﻿﻿﻿d march beside me hand-in-hand
and who’﻿﻿﻿d expect me to remember names
when Liz’﻿﻿﻿s girlfriend saw us and waved “Hi.
It’﻿﻿﻿s . . . Anna”? (CNN shot feed, then frames.)
Booze-stymied by the glare of girls and sky,
how could I choose? Should I grip hand, or pray
wondering: Is today today the day
she’﻿﻿﻿ll let me turn the key, lead her inside?

 
     2

Okay, I’﻿﻿﻿m sober now. Today is just
the kind of day she talks but feels no lust.

 
     3

Beside her isn’﻿﻿﻿t bad. Fan-stirred, the air
is humid and the theater is packed.
An ear-cuffed thespian tries to fix the cold,
our leading ladies sweat it out in back.
A prim man to my right begins to sneeze.
My nose is in agreement. The perfume
from Queen Mother there could clear the room.
This shadow play across her face is fine.
Her arm’﻿﻿﻿s near mine, which means exactly nothing.
Hope’﻿﻿﻿s hope hums on through separate listening.
That skull, opaque to me as Midland’﻿﻿﻿s vault,
her silky crop, its pepper dabbed with salt —
I chuckle at an apt sardonic line.
Her suede complexion, lifts up, checks the time.

 
     4. Les Nouvceaux from La Nouvelle Justine

I don’﻿﻿﻿t love her. She doesn’﻿﻿﻿t love me. Neither
does this waiter who may think it strange
when young girls dine with staid dames twice their age
on salade de Bastille and pain de Sade.
I don’﻿﻿﻿t like sitting by her like wet cloth.
I don’﻿﻿﻿t like restaurants whose queers pawn sex
to the bachelor bunch who want a thrill.
I don’﻿﻿﻿t like dining with my, well, not-ex,
both measuring the humid air for signs
of sparks I see by parts will not ignite.
I’﻿﻿﻿d rather have a knock-down, drag-out fight
that cleared the joint than watch another guy
get spanked by Corset Kris, who’﻿﻿﻿d like to grab
a tit, not spend hip humping hairy thighs.
I’﻿﻿﻿d rather I were twice her age and wise.
I’﻿﻿﻿d spin cruel stories of past day of bliss
then give my own hands covert exercise
and send her home to bed without a kiss.
 

     5. L’﻿﻿﻿Addition
 
30 for the play and 10 for gins,
10 for two cabs and 40 for the eats,
at least the metro home was freezer-cold,
at least the Broadway Local still had seats
at 96th, the local went express.
I blistered home ten sockless humid blocks
back to my solo digs for solo sex.
I got this poem for my 90 bucks."
1829,The Rain,Robert Creeley,"All night the sound had
come back again,
and again falls
this quiet, persistent rain.
 
What am I to myself
that must be remembered,
insisted upon
so often? Is it
 
that never the ease,
even the hardness,
of rain falling
will have for me
 
something other than this,
something not so insistent—
am I to be locked in this
final uneasiness.
 
Love, if you love me,
lie next to me.
Be for me, like rain,
the getting out
 
of the tiredness, the fatuousness, the semi-
lust of intentional indifference.
Be wet
with a decent happiness."
1830,Southern Bred,Charles Ghigna,"In the backyard
of my father’﻿s house
a hen’﻿s warm neck
once filled the center
of my pale fist.

Her place on the stump
still wears my shadow
like a stain."
1831,The Tunnel,Robert Creeley,"Tonight, nothing is long enough—
time isn’﻿t.
Were there a fire,
it would burn now.
 
Were there a heaven,
I would have gone long ago.
I think that light
is the final image.
 
But time reoccurs,
love—and an echo.
A time passes
love in the dark."
1832,The Whip,Robert Creeley,"I spent a night turning in bed,
my love was a feather, a flat
 
sleeping thing. She was
very white
 
and quiet, and above us on
the roof, there was another woman I
 
also loved, had
addressed myself to in
 
a fit she
returned. That
 
encompasses it. But now I was
lonely, I yelled,
 
but what is that? Ugh,
she said, beside me, she put
 
her hand on
my back, for which act
 
I think to say this
wrongly."
1833,13 December,Kate Greenstreet,"She considers a field. She considers a field and buys it. Let her have the fruit of her hands.


 


We come down from the mountains. Yellow trees, green trees. I was leaving Earth but, before I did, I had to get rid of all my animals. My main one, my main model for behavior, was my snake. He was attached to the bottom of my foot but had become dangerous seeming and I was afraid he would bite me if he got the chance. My sister was there and I said, “Before I leave, I have to get rid of all my animals,” thinking maybe she’d help me. I said, “My horse, my frog, my snake…” but didn’t mention I was worried about how to dislodge my snake safely. As I was waking up, I thought of going to a place where they could give the snake a shot to knock it out or even kill it before they tried to get it off my foot. Which seemed like a pretty good idea, though inconvenient."
1834,7 December,Kate Greenstreet,"Men are trading their bullets for worms.


“I spent a lifetime building.”


 


We come down from the mountains. We brought eggs, a table, a windowshade. There were times when we couldn’t bring anything. So many people.


 


As you were walking up the hill and I was walking down, we almost passed each other. But I grasped your arm and backed up. You said: “This is what I look like now.”

1835,Arroyo: Flash Flood,John Unterecker,"The canyon walls close in again,
slant light a silver glare in brown water.
The water is only knee deep, but when the boy reaches the
   boulders—
purple dark, silvered by the smash of brute water—
water will tear at his chest and arms.
The walls of the canyon are brilliant in late light.
They would have glared red and gold for his drowned camera:
splashed blood to his left, to his right a wall of sun laddered
   with boulders.
 
More than boulders.    Some stranger once fought down this
   cliffside,
his rope of twisted dry vines strung boulder to boulder,
clifftop to arroyo.    Escape.    Escape maybe.    Maybe bones
   in the desert.
I think of hands scuffed raw from the braiding.
 
Almost….  Water froths over the boulders,
tugs at the boy’s footing.       Almost….
The blood cliff to his left blinds him.    Blind nails scrape at
    two boulders,
a torn vine whipping somewhere above him.
 
He wedges knees against polished rock, pressing up, clawing
    slick stone.
Now.    Rope cutting his hand, he skids underwater:
silver and froth, a film of bright blood staining his eyes.
But he drags hand over hand up out of the water, climbing
    the sun
hand over hand, the ancient vines holding,
boulders for foothold, up out of that canyon."

1837,Chronic,D. A. Powell,"were lifted over the valley, its steepling dustdevils
the redwinged blackbirds convened
vibrant arc their swift, their dive against the filmy, the finite air
 
the profession of absence, of being absented, a lifting skyward
then gone
the moment of flight: another resignation from the sweep of earth
 
jackrabbit, swallowtail, harlequin duck: believe in this refuge
vivid tips of oleander
white and red perimeters where no perimeter should be
 
 
 
               here is another in my long list of asides:
why have I never had a clock that actually gained time?
that apparatus, which measures out the minutes, is our own image
                         forever losing
 
and so the delicate, unfixed condition of love, the treacherous body
the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged—
isn’t one a suitable lens through which to see another:
               filter the body, filter the mind, filter the resilient land
 
 
 
and by resilient I mean which holds
              which tolerates the inconstant lover, the pitiful treatment
the experiment, the untried & untrue, the last stab at wellness
 
choose your own adventure: drug failure or organ failure
cataclysmic climate change
or something akin to what’s killing bees—colony collapse
 
more like us than we’d allow, this wondrous swatch of rough
 
 
 
why do I need to say the toads and moor and clouds—﻿
in a spring of misunderstanding, I took the cricket’s sound
 
and delight I took in the sex of every season, the tumble on moss
the loud company of musicians, the shy young bookseller
anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble
             to be picked from the crepuscule at the forest’s edge
 
until the nocturnal animals crept forth
             their eyes like the lamps in store windows
                          forgotten, vaguely firing a desire for home
 
hence, the body’s burden, its resolute campaign:  trudge on
 
and if the war does not shake us from our quietude, nothing will
 
I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried
             a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy
for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere
 
 
 
by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures:
sprig of lilac, scent of pine
the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch, their song
 
the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom
              and the cherry forms its first full buds
the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth
              and youth passing into maturity, ripening its flesh
growing softer, less unattainable, ruddy and spotted plum
 
 
 
daily, I mistake—there was a medication I forgot to take
there was a man who gave himself, decently, to me & I refused him
 
in a protracted stillness, I saw that heron I didn’t wish to disturb
was clearly a white sack caught in the redbud’s limbs
 
I did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until—
              daylight, don’t leave me now, I haven’t done with you—
                            nor that, in this late hour, we still cannot make peace
 
 
 
if I, inconsequential being that I am, forsake all others
how many others correspondingly forsake this world

I sing you this song and I will sing another as well

The last thing you think of.
Won’t be my fluffy blonde hair.
 
We have his ear.
He was the first boy I knew. The liberation.
Which I remember
from sand. The pail shape. The whole world’s washed out.
 
These words: take refuge.
What I mean by dream in this case is
his last dream.
And you see no land, you’re that far away.
 
Someone coughs
in my first life.
Someone must have noticed
how like you he is…
 
First you can’t be heard
Then you can’t hear
Then you can’t dial
Then you can’t turn it off
 
 You pose a question, I repeat it.
 And as always with speech, one is blind.
 
As a reflector, as of cloth or
thick flecked glass, as slats—
You asked though
 
about the self.
There were fireflies,
and the corn cut to the nubs. The windows
shook, we saw a flash of light…
 
then the tiniest
feckles
of rain
 
after we waited
all day."

1841,Hospital,John Unterecker,"I. PULSE


 


Light over the Hudson recovers a Caribbean I have


       never seen.


We list islands: Molokai, Oahu, Kauai; St. Lucia,


       Haiti….


The surf folds tunnels of light


while a hand folds over a wrist (tell-tale pulse),


counting. The long tunnel is a wrist of blown spume.


 


It is like a dance, I think, this silence full of questions.


Pulse-beat; pulse-beat.     Pulse.     Pulse.


 


I push my hair back into the memories of palm trees,


brushing my hands and my  hair on the islands.


 


 


2. NIGHT MUSIC

Garlic and sapphires in the mud...


                                  T.S. Eliot


 


The window opens onto a fire escape.


The Sausage Manufacturers’ Chamber Group, scattered


      among potted geraniums and dying petunias,


plays Hindemith’s 
Kleine Kammermusik
. The oboist,


his briefcase full of knockwurst and reeds, is suffering


      from hiccups.


The cheerful notes—hiccups on oboe—float in through


      the window.


Ralph turns in bed, a flailing arm upsetting the urinal.


Perhaps he is awake.           A pale German shepherd


      leaps through the window,


over the bars of the hospital bed, and begins to lick


      Ralph’s feet.


Why are Ralph’s feet out of the covers? The dog looks


      up, and says “Ralph,”


and walks up Ralph’s stomach to stare in his eyes.


“Where is your bone?” Ralph says; but the dog curls up


      under Ralph’s left arm and falls asleep.


“Why not?” Ralph thinks. The musicians have departed,


only a faint odor of garlic lingering on the windowsill.


“I could call you Fritz,” Ralph says to the sleeping dog,


“﻿or Cokie or maybe even Pepe. But I’ll call you Ralph.”


This time the music comes through the window


      without hiccups and without garlic.


 


 


3. THE INVENTIONS OF SLEEP


 


A telephone call begins on the television set:


You are in a phone booth, headlights in the distance,


behind you couples strolling in a park. We almost know 


      each other’s names,


and I think about children moving out of darkness into


      patches of light then back into darkness.


Their voices are a murmur under your soft voice.


      “I’m tired now,” you say; “I haven’t been called before.”


 


In Manitoba winter, in loose snow thrown up by the


      Canadian Pacific, elk burrow down,


their great antlers caught in the dining car lights. Their


       heads turn to each other in snow,


muzzles, flanks touching under the snow line.


 


If I am asleep, your voice is folded under my arm,


and I whisper, “sleep well,” watching the antlers turn


      to each other in loose snow,


the summer voices blurred by city traffic.


 


 


4. THE DARK, THE DREAM


 


At 11:15, I will follow the last corridor into darkness.


At 10:30, when I had spoken to the darkness for the


        first time, I had asked the darkness the names


of all the corridors, calling your name into every closed


         door.


But tonight all of the doors are windows.


 


         Hide and seek:


 


               Helen     George     Barbara     Tom     Sheryl


         of patches of fog on an Irish lake,


                Roger watching swans vanish.


          Muffie dancing       Jim climbing the switchback


              trail into light.


                  Margaret and Mike dealing the cards, Janet


                   asleep.


 


Lights go on and off back of the windows: I call your


      name at the head of each corridor.


                …not windows.


Vyvian hands me the negatives: ten seconds:


Theone on the far side of the car:      four a.m., truth


      balanced on a steering wheel;


ten seconds: my mother’s body falling toward darkness,


the dead child falling, Bob Pawlowsky falling:        I


        have no goodbye.


 


 


. . .


 


11:15: hide and seek, and the long corridor darkening


        against night’s invention echo lengthening.


—my way now, calling.


 


 


5. SCARS


 


That little scar I’ll never see on the left underside of my


   heart


or the almost-closed arteries opening and closing like


   baby mouths


or the good artery, a tiny flow talking about


   tomorrow….


 


Strange in the garden, watching two boys wrestle in


    long grass,


their wheelchair friend in zebra-striped pajamas watching


    the wrestling,


all three in the hungry shade of a magnolia.


Binoculars:


The boy in striped pajamas’ dense shouts: shouting,


    shouting:


“Quit it, you cocksuckers! They won’t even let you


    
walk
 on the grass. Quit!”


They are hidden by the magnolia. I cannot hear them.


The long magnolia branches wrestle like boys’ white


    arms and legs.


 


That scar in the groin: hernia. Punched hole in the


    groin: heart catheter.


The new scar throat to belly.


 


Now they have helped the zebra boy back into the


    wheelchair


and, pushing him up the hospital ramp, take turns


    bumping shoulders.


“Quit it you pricks! Do you want me thrown out of the


   place?”


 


I listen to my casual heart beating veins into arteries;


    then I approach the zebra and his friends.


 


In Africa, wildebeest, impala, warthog gather at the


    waterhold, nudging shoulders.


The gaunt flat-topped trees cast lion shadows,


vultures circling. Where are the sabre tooth tiger, the


    mastodon?


 


I think of America cemented coast to coast, white


    jet-trail scars for sky,


a loveliness of footprints jumbled on spring grass.


 


 


6. POST-OPERATIVE (1)


 


Fever again: 101           slow footsteps


on the beach. The footsteps are a conversation in the


    waves.


“Come. I’m here.”    I am walking toward the


    long-haired woman


wrestling already her bright shoulders’ turning.


On the shore, gaunt lovers wrestle bone against bone,


rib cages interlocked, bone grinding:


slow footsteps           music on dry sand


 


 


7. POST OPERATIVE (2)


 


Joy crusted with pain:


   fresh lava


   breaking through


   a shifting black map


   in the crater pit:


           Mauna Ulu: New Mountain.


 


   Seabird, seabird, fly the old lava. In long light, at the foot of the pali, press in on the 40-foot spine, legs wrapping heads; arms, torso, genitals cradled in legs, a 40-foot snake, chain of love, birth chain, twisting in the long ocean light, an arm under the dark cloud brushing generations of lovers. Seabird, seabird, fly in on a long stroke of cold light.


 


 


8. POST-OPERATIVE (3): THE ELEVATOR


 


Elevator: a hand on my shoulder, a hand on the


    wheelchair, hands brushing my hair…


or the blown hair of a woman shouldered in


    sea-foam…


elk burrowing in loose snow…


or a mouth opening, closing       mouths meeting.


 


In one step, I am free, my feet firm.


This is Manhattan, the cement island, below me the


    Hudson roped in pale rain.


Three boys break into a run, dodging taxis.


Their jeans are tight wet skins, their wet faces masks.


“Run fast!”


The towers of the hospital shape sky.


 


Haiti, Kauai, Manhattan—white shoulders of the sea


   breaking down every island.


 


A little box on a chain goes up and down:      up


    down.


 


      Once, in a dream, the elevator reached top floor, then shifted sideways, finding another shaft; at basement, it returned to floor 1, returned to basement, floor 1, basement, then floor 10, floor 11—sideways on floor 11, doors opening into mouths.


 


A mouth in my heart says a name, calling. Then


    another, another.


 


I brush dry sand from my arms that are streaming rain,


turning toward Broadway."
1842,Lemon Tree,Landis Everson,"A tree that grew in the Garden of Eden
a tree of innocence called
the Tree of Good and Evil. It was harmless
 
as opposites are in balance. It was also
tasteless,
the taste of innocence before it is betrayed.
When God removed the wall
 
he gave the lemon thorns and bitterness because it had
no hostility.
It is a taste we want most to subdue. It asks
to be left alone.
We use it with fish and tea. We sugar it.
 
Look out the window. It stands with a donkey’s
stance, hoping the day will pass.
Its scent through the curtains
cuts through
mustiness, sharp
with sweet blossoms. It hides the smell
of new babies.

i pass my grey mornings re-running the reels
and the images are the same but the emphasis shifts
the actors bow gently to me and i envy them
their repeated parts, their constant presence in that world

i would be eight people each inhabiting the others’ dreams
walking through corridors of glass framed pages
telling each other the final lines of letters
picking fruit in one dream and storing it in another

1846,Akiba,Muriel Rukeyser,"THE WAY OUT
 
The night is covered with signs. The body and face of man,
with signs, and his journeys.     Where the rock is split
and speaks to the water;     the flame speaks to the cloud;
the red splatter, abstraction, on the door
speaks to the angel and the constellations.
The grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon.
And the loud hammering of the land behind
speaks ringing up the bones of our thighs, the hoofs,
we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea.
 
All night down the centuries, have heard, music of passage.
 
Music of one child carried into the desert;
firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid.
Drawn through the water with the water-drawn people
led by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain.
The voice of the world speaking, the world covered by signs,
the burning, the loving, the speaking, the opening.
Strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain.
Still flame, the spoken singing of a young child.
The meaning beginning to move, which is the song.
 
Music of those who have walked out of slavery.
 
Into that journey where all things speak to all things
refusing to accept the curse, and taking
for signs the signs of all things, the world, the body
which is part of the soul, and speaks to the world,
all creation being created in one image, creation.
This is not the past walking into the future,
the walk is painful, into the present, the dance
not visible as dance until much later.
These dancers are discoverers of God.
 
We knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song.
 
Out of a life of building lack on lack:
the slaves refusing slavery, escaping into faith:
an army who came to the ocean: the walkers
who walked through the opposites, from I to opened Thou,
city and cleave of the sea. Those at flaming Nauvoo,
the ice on the great river: the escaping Negroes,
swamp and wild city: the shivering children of Paris
and the glass black hearses; those on the Long March:
all those who together are the frontier, forehead of man.
 
Where the wilderness enters, the world, the song of the world.
 
Akiba rescued, secretly, in the clothes of death
by his disciples carried from Jerusalem
in blackness journeying to find his journey
to whatever he was loving with his life.
The wilderness journey through which we move
under the whirlwind truth into the new,
the only accurate. A cluster of lights at night:
faces before the pillar of fire. A child watching
while the sea breaks open. This night. The way in.
 
Barbarian music, a new song.
 
Acknowledging opened water, possibility:
open like a woman to this meaning.
In a time of building statues of the stars,
valuing certain partial ferocious skills
while past us the chill and immense wilderness
spreads its one-color wings until we know
rock, water, flame, cloud, or the floor of the sea,
the world is a sign, a way of speaking. To find.
What shall we find? Energies, rhythms, journey.
 
Ways to discover. The song of the way in."
1847,The Book of Equality,Daniel Borzutzky,"Here the readers gather to watch the books die. They die suddenly, as if thrown from an airplane, or from spontaneous cardiac arrest. They live, and then suddenly they die, and the reader who watches this is at the moment of the books' death bombarded with images documented through the smiling lipstick face of a journalist who has shown up to report on the death of the books. The milk was poisoned and forty-two babies died, she laughs, as she fondles the ashes of the dead books. And the death of forty-two babies is equal in value to the death of this book which is equal in value to the ninety-year old woman who shot herself while the sheriff waited at her door with an eviction notice which is equal in value to the collapsing of the global economy which is equal to the military in country XYZ seizing the land of the semi-nomadic hunters and cultivators of crops who have lived in the local rain forest for thousands of years. The reader opens a dead book and finds an infinite amount of burnt ash between the bindings, and when the ash blows in the wind the lipstick says that every death in the world is equal to every other death in the world which is equal to every birth in the world which is equal to every act of dismemberment which is equal to the death of a jungle which is equal to the collapse of the global economy; and hey look there’s another lady falling out of a window; she looks about equal to the poet hurled out of his country for words he wrote but which did not belong to him and whose death is about equal to the girl who was shot on the bus on her way to school this morning which is just about the same as the bearded man whose head was shoved into a sac while water was dumped over it and he died for an instant and came back to life and talked and talked and that’s about equal to the steroid illegally injected into the arm of a beautiful man who makes forty million dollars a year for injecting his arms with steroids so he can more skillfully wave a wooden stick at a ball, and in the ash we see the truest democracy there ever was: hey look it’s a little baby found in a dumpster how equal you are says the smiling lipstick to the civilized nation whose citizens walk the flooded streets looking for their homes, and in the ashes of the dead book the dead streets are equal to the eating disorders of movie stars which are equal to the dead soldiers who are equal to the homeruns which are equal to the bomb dropped by country ABC over weddings in the village of country XYZ which is equal to the earth swallowing up and devouring all of its foreigners which is just about equal to the decline in literacy in the most educated nation in the planet. There is no end to this book. There are no paragraph breaks to interrupt the smiling lipstick that goes on and on in one string of ashy words about how the declaration of peace is equal to the resumption of war and how the bodies that fall are equal to the birds that ascend and how the bomb in the Eiffel Tower is equal to the rising cost of natural gas, and the murmurs of the voices in the mud are equal to the murmurs of the expensive suits falling out of buildings and these are equal to the silence that kills with one breath and coddles life with another."
1848,The Book of Non-Writing ﻿,Daniel Borzutzky,"There should be a writing of non-writing. Someday it will come.                                       
       A brief writing, without grammar, a writing of words alone.                                             
         Words without supporting grammar. Lost. Written, there.

                    It came. Words smashed out of the sky and from the mouths and off the pages and from the flesh and blood of the bodies and the words hit the readers and were destroyed like more bodies and the fields of the nation were littered with bodies and dead. Carcass love, they called it. Carcass economy, they called it. And the readers found the carcasses strewn across the pages and the readers came and stripped their innards and twirled intestines above their heads like lassos. The carcasses fell onto the pages and were taken away in wagons and trucks and they were replaced with new carcasses that were sold for words before the flies laid eggs and the wounds had time to fester. FALSE CARCASS ECONOMY! Will the souls of the carcasses miss themselves when they die? Will the bodies whose lips slurp out the souls of the carcasses miss themselves when they die? Will the words from the bodies who slurp out the souls of the carcasses cease to exist when the bodies themselves die? The readers grovel in the pages and find themselves in ditches with the carcasses but they do not know the rules of the false carcass economy. In this book the readers can feel their feet being removed. In this book the readers can feel the splash of the abattoir blood that sprinkles the page with poems. How do you know if the poems have too many bubbles? That is, how do you know if the blood of the poems has too many bubbles? When we speak of our own lives, says the collective voice of the readers, we certainly don’t mean human life. On the page the readers find themselves crawling around like quadrupeds with hands full of grass and earth uprooting plants and trees setting out for home and not getting far counting corpses on the fields to hell with animals there is God grinding his teeth with joy forging his way through the ruins of failing flesh there is the machine that has annihilated the bulk of humanity is it semen or is it a carburetor that makes us unrecognizable we know who we are through decay and in someone else’s story this is a lot worse than knocking your own brains out with good results then drinking tea with sugar and milk and suddenly feeling revived then exploding with words and speaking with animals and sinking in mud and being found by peasants who clean turds and who are like silent gods with holes in their shoes it is horrible to eat horrible to bulge in the belly with food horrible to blink when so many can’t blink oh to ruminate once more on the air polluted with liability on the hair singed from pollution the eyes burning fingers shrivelling the exact moment of ending will not come for many millennia we will not be able to document it it will document us it’s okay to kill some bodies speak of nothing and you’re lucky to make friends flank kidney liver swollen body on the sand who are you now that I am speaking with a mouth full of words that do not belong to me I crawl across the page and I don’t know if I’m dying or dead."

1850,The Hero,John Unterecker,"Mortal and full of praise,
I watch the enchanted hero busy at his chores:
desert, tundra,
prairie restless
under an easy stride.
 
Dagger in belt, sword
slapping thigh, he passes
from sight, the restored land
sprung airily
to green praise.
 
    Arachnid webs entangle life.
    A busyness of thread
    weaves silk into night—
    the long shudder of moonlight,
    a transfixed eye shuddering.
 
    Nothing is so easy as death, I try to say.
 
    But the hard fact of glazed eyes, the boy turned to
        solitude, lies
    face up in the center of all webs, roads
    unwinding stubble.
                                     Whoever is alone
    walks brittle filaments, late
    stars smudged on dawn, a night sky’s frayed
    dawn.
              Dare we evaluate life:
    This hero’s gesture charms eternity?
 
Someone who paused here once on an ordinary day,
troubled by the impatience of his calling,
set up a hasty signpost:
“Toward…”
 
    Nothing is so scarred
    as this place, shards of parched
    cloth trampled by footprints coiling
    crazed centers.
                             Fresh with spring, light breezes play
    on dust.
                      A whisper of rain. Ropes of skeined thunder
       twist sky."

Waves were broken scrolls.          Beyond Donegal, white mountains

on the Drumholm road; near Timoney’s farm, a frantic goose
pinned under branches.
 
                                        All night long, we spoke of loneliness,
long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.
 
Then the sky cleared and a marvel began: The hills turned blue;
in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day’s first plume of smoke.
It gathered like a dream drenched in frost.
 
That should have been all.                           We had worn out night.
 
But single-file,  deliberate,  five heifers,  a black bull,  three calves stepped  through the
                                                                                                                                    broken fence.
They arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram:
a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.
 
Their image is with me still.               The backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as
                                                                                                                                     morning."
1853,[Murmurs from the earth of this land],Muriel Rukeyser,"Murmurs from the earth of this land, from the caves and craters,
       from the bowl of darkness. Down watercourses of our
       dragon childhood, where we ran barefoot.
We stand as growing women and men. Murmurs come down
        where water has not run for sixty years.
Murmurs from the tulip tree and the catalpa, from the ax of
        the stars, from the house on fire, ringing of glass; from
        the abandoned iron-black mill.
Stars with voices crying like mountain lions over forgotten
        colors.
Blue directions and a horizon, milky around the cities where the
        murmurs are deep enough to penetrate deep rock.
Trapping the lightning-bird, trapping the red central roots.
You know the murmurs. They come from your own throat.
You are the bridges to the city and the blazing food-plant green;
The sun of plants speaks in your voice, and the infinite shells of
        accretions
A beach of dream before the smoking mirror.
You are close to that surf, and the leaves heated by noon, and
        the star-ax, the miner’s glitter walls. The crests of the sea
Are the same strength you wake with, the darkness is the eyes
        of children forming for a blaze of sight and soon, soon,
Everywhere your own silence, who drink from the crater, the
        nebula, one another, the changes of the soul."

1855,Night Feeding,Muriel Rukeyser,"Deeper than sleep but not so deep as death
I lay there dreaming and my magic head
remembered and forgot. On first cry I
remembered and forgot and did believe.
I knew love and I knew evil:
woke to the burning song and the tree burning blind,
despair of our days and the calm milk-giver who
knows sleep, knows growth, the sex of fire and grass,
renewal of all waters and the time of the stars
and the black snake with gold bones.
 
Black sleeps, gold burns; on second cry I woke
fully and gave to feed and fed on feeding.
Gold seed, green pain, my wizards in the earth
walked through the house, black in the morning dark.
Shadows grew in my veins, my bright belief,
my head of dreams deeper than night and sleep.
Voices of all black animals crying to drink,
cries of all birth arise, simple as we,
found in the leaves, in clouds and dark, in dream,
deep as this hour, ready again to sleep."

1859,Song at Drumholm,John Unterecker,"My liveliest self, I give you fair leave
in these windblown weathers,
heather-hearted and human and strange,
to turn every blackberry corner

The robin, singing her love-me-forever,
kiss-catch-clutch-in the heather
blues, sings tide flow
and autumn’s turning and white
winds folding.
 
Cattle along all hedges wind winter
into their frosty
breathing, their slow eyes dreaming
barn, bullock, and fodder
under all hedges.
 
But sea cave and sycamore tell us the world
is wider than weather.
Blackberries darken the corners
I turn, and gold seas turning
darken, darken.
 
My liveliest self, my other, Godspeed
on our farings.
The bronze path at evening.            Toward summer,
then.                        My hand, your hand—
as if first meeting."
1860,The Speaking Tree,Muriel Rukeyser,"for Robert Payne

Great Alexander sailing was from his true course turned
By a young wind from a cloud in Asia moving
Like a most recognizable most silvery woman;
Tall Alexander to the island came.
The small breeze blew behind his turning head.
He walked the foam of ripples into this scene.
 
The trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk
Until you look again.     Then people and animals
Are ripening on the branches;     the broad leaves
Are leaves;     pale horses, sharp fine foxes
Blossom;     the red rabbit falls
Ready and running.     The trunk coils, turns,
Snakes, fishes.     Now the ripe people fall and run,
Three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand
Where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame.
 
Stiff Alexander stands.     He cannot turn.
But he is free to turn : this is the speaking tree,
It calls your name.     It tells us what we mean."
1861,spring song,Lucille Clifton,"the green of Jesus
is breaking the ground
and the sweet

1862,Unravelling / Shock,Nathaniel Tarn,"A hole torn in the fabric of the world,
the web, the whole infernal weave
through which life-giving rain is falling
but mixing with the tears and with the blood.
Dead body-snatchers enter, the mega-corpses,
much in the news these days, enter and grind
bones, flesh and sinews down to dry tree bark,
mixing with tree bark, crawling with the demonic
beetles. They’ll tell it later: “No one expected this”:
not one—patient, doctors, practitioners
of every stripe, no one except the one whose daily
work is close to prophecy, who feels it in his nerves
or in her muscles—where news travels up fast
and lodges in the eyes, all-seeing, all-pervading vision
of disaster. And comes in like a mouse, wee small,
[wee modest, so wee, wee practical,] mouse with big ears
and popping eyes, looking this way and that and not
one tittle-tattle fazed by your huge presence. Later
drowns in a bucket with a lizard: everything drowns
round here getting to water. Not able to get out again.
Thus coming quietly, thus probing, [thus stealing in,]
squatting thus quietly back of the house:
how do the tears well up, well down again,
what makes them well, the seeing eyes know not,
what routes the change parent-to-orphan? Stop.
Orphan-to-parent? Stop. Then back again to tears?
Look out beyond the healthy trees preserved
in a close circle round the house for privacy,
look out the window over hills and dales
of this milagro country, see living green, see dying
brown—on each and every morning mourn the trees.
Criminal imbeciles who run the shows we live in
from top to bottom of their slimy theater, have now
decreed they will not solve the water. Matter of fact,
they will not solve what we are made of—the high
percentage water in all of us compounded. They will not
solve a single problem by the name of life we give
to human business. They will prefer
to dip their steel in blood, to let the semen drip
from off of their steel into the blood and thus contaminate,
infuse with every cancer both body politic and body
not so politic, just private, single, individual—but
gives to other individuals their mien and color. Ghosts
walk the hills and dales between the dying trees.
“Remember now,” they say, with stab at tragic countenance,
[for when can privacy enter into collective?] “those days,
those days you took no notice of, counting them poor,
dispersing them among the memories you could not value
at their true worth, you could not recognize enough to feel:
who knows if these few days, [these very days], were not
those ones we lived together here, the only paradise?”"
1863,Waterlily Fire,Muriel Rukeyser,"for Richard Griffith

1  THE BURNING
 
Girl grown woman     fire     mother of fire
I go to the stone street turning to fire.     Voices
Go screaming     Fire     to the green glass wall.
And there where my youth flies blazing into fire
The     dance     of sane and insane images, noon
Of seasons and days.     Noontime of my one hour.
 
Saw down the bright noon street the crooked faces
Among the tall daylight in the city of change.
The scene has walls     stone     glass     all my gone life
One wall a web through which the moment walks
And I am open, and the opened hour
The world as water-garden     lying behind it.
In a city of stone, necessity of fountains,
Forces water fallen on glass, men with their axes.
 
An arm of flame reaches from water-green glass,
Behind the wall I know waterlilies
Drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes
Skythrown under water, clouds under those flowers,
Walls standing on all things stand in a city noon
Who will not believe a waterlily fire.
Whatever can happen in a city of stone,
Whatever can come to a wall can come to this wall.
 
I walk in the river of crisis toward the real,
I pass guards, finding the center of my fear
And you, Dick, endlessly my friend during storm.
 
The arm of flame striking through the wall of form.
 
 
2  THE ISLAND
 
Born of this river and this rock island, I relate
The changes : I born when the whirling snow
Rained past the general’s grave and the amiable child
White past the windows of the house of Gyp the Blood.
General, gangster, child.     I know in myself the island.
 
I was the island without bridges, the child down whose blazing
Eye the men of plumes and bone raced their canoes and fire
Among the building of my young childhood, houses;
I was those changes, the live darknesses
Of wood, the pale grain of a grove in the fields
Over the river fronting red cliffs across—
And always surrounding her the river, birdcries, the wild
Father building his sand, the mother in panic her parks—
Bridges were thrown across, the girl arose
From sleeping streams of change in the change city.
The violent forgetting, the naked sides of darkness.
Fountain of a city in growth, and island of light and water.
Snow striking up past the graves, the yellow cry of spring.
 
Whatever can come to a city can come to this city.
Under the tall compulsion
                                                   of the past
I see the city
                          change like a man changing
I love this man
                               with my lifelong body of love
I know you
                        among your changes
                                                                  wherever I go
Hearing the sounds of building
                                                          the syllables of wrecking
A young girl watching
                                              the man throwing red hot rivets
Coals in a bucket of change
How can you love a city that will not stay?
I love you
                       like a man of life in change.
 
Leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
Like today accepted and become one’s self
I go, I am a city with bridges and tunnels,
Rock, cloud, ships, voices.     To the man where the river met
The tracks, now buried deep along the Drive
Where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red.
 
Towers falling.     A dream of towers.
Necessity of fountains.     And my poor,
Stirring among our dreams,
Poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
And lives, looking out through my eyes.
The city the growing body of our hate and love.
The root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
A male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
Male flower heading upstream.
 
Among a city of light, the stone that grows.
Stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
Monuments rivetted against flesh.
Blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
Stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and I
See stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
Lilies of all my life on fire.
Flash faith in a city building its fantasies.
 
I walk past the guards into my city of change.
 
 
3  JOURNEY CHANGES
 
Many of us     Each in his own life waiting
Waiting to move     Beginning to move     Walking
And early on the road of the hill of the world
Come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
 
The stages of the theatre of the journey
 
I see the time of willingness between plays
Waiting and walking and the play of the body
Silver body with its bosses and places
One by one touched awakened into into
 
Touched and turned one by one into     flame
 
The theatre of the advancing goddess     Blossoming
Smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
Slowness in her blue dress advancing standing I go
And far across a field over the jewel grass
 
The play of the family stroke by stroke acted out
 
Gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
Of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
A supple god of searching and reaching
Who weaves his strength     Who dances her more alive
 
The theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses
 
Always the journey     long     patient     many haltings
Many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
When the decision to go on is made
Along the long slopes of choice and again the world
 
The play of poetry approaching in its solving
 
Solvings of relations in poems and silences
For we were born to express     born for a journey
Caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
And then I came to the place of mournful labor
 
A turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff
 
Over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
Seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
A hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
Repeated farther than sight.     The voice saying slowly
 
But it is hell.     I heard my own voice in the words
Or it could be a foundation     And after the words
My chance came.     To enter.     The theatres of the world.
 
 
4  FRAGILE
 
I think of the image brought into my room
Of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
He is asking about the moment when the Buddha
Offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
“Isn’t that fragile?” he asks.     The sage answers:
“I speak to you.     You speak to me.     Is that fragile?”
 
 
5  THE LONG BODY
 
This journey is exploring us. Where the child stood
An island in a river of crisis, now
The bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
Is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
We pray : we dive into each other’s eyes.
 
Whatever can come to a woman can come to me.
 
This is the long body : into life from the beginning,
Big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
And then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
And now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
Going as we go in the changes of the body,
As it is changes, in the long strip of our many
Shapes, as we range shifting through time.
The long body : a procession of images.
 
This moment in a city, in its dream of war.
                                              We chose to be,
Becoming the only ones under the trees
                                                                            when the harsh sound
Of the machine sirens spoke. There were these two men,
And the bearded one, the boys, the Negro mother feeding
Her baby. And threats, the ambulance with open doors.
Now silence. Everyone else within the walls. We sang.
                               We are the living island,
We the flesh of this island, being lived,
Whoever knows us is part of us today.
 
Whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
 
Fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
Reaching from darkness upward to a sun
Of rebirth, the implacable.     And in our myth
The Changing Woman who is still and who offers.
 
Eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
That struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
In ways of being, through silence, sources of light
Arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
 
And everything a witness of the buried life.
This moment flowing across the sun, this force
Of flowers and voices body in body through space.
The city of endless cycles of the sun.
 
I speak to you     You speak to me"
1864,"...Within, Into, Inside, Under, Within...",John Unterecker,"I
 
Beginnings: a chrysalis improvisation
in the wings, roles
taking on flesh before a role begins…
 
as light begins in the elm,
pushing the long elm branches into night,
a ghost light pressing sky…
 
or actors, swollen with strange selves,
distended to the edges of tight skin,
a brightness under moth-wing fingertips.
 
White arms stretch out toward truth.
The stage is full of light.
Your brightness gloves my skin.
 
 
II
 
Alice, grown huge, swollen to fit of the tunnels,
tiny, unable to reach a gold key,
knew what gardens were for—
 
yet never knelt in tunnels of rough sunlight
to will flamboyance from green buds.
The swollen poppy twists within its cap,
 
a pink invention wrestling light.
How often I think of tunneling roots,
curtains of roots, white ropes
 
that stroked our hair when we entered tunnels.
Here, we are rubbed on gold.
This wedge of pink beginnings troubles gardens.
 
 
III
 
A robin listens to darkness.
I think of worms, grubs, moles,
the slow ballet of rootlets twisting down,
 
of cave fish, blacksnakes,
and, asleep at Nieux, the great black bulls
that thunder on dark walls.
 
When we wear another self,
do our souls darken? On a bright stage,
do we enter darkest places?
 
 
IV
 
There is darkness clinging to the undersides of leaves.
 
For we are entering darkness. It skuffs along cave walls,
stumbling and skuffing fingertips.
At Mycenae, it is a heavy must,
a musty heavy breath in the hundred-step cistern.
 
They wait, dark passageways in old houses, their worn
silence frayed under a blur
of footsteps. Our stretched-out hands
manipulate evasive cellar shadows.
 
Within the garden, silence darkens windblown leaves.
 
 
V
 
Oh I think of Alice gone down, down
under groundcover dreams,
a man’s tunneled night.
 
Who are these actors? On dream stages, I forget
lines. My tongue-tied
silence foundering…     Stage props
mumble rigidities.        The audience…
 
I think of silences at Nieux,
at Mycenae, the tourists
gone, guides returned
to wives, houses….
 
And those silences of capricious light.
The calex splits, an abrupt pink flame.
Orpheus’ torch descends and still descends through
    arias of reddest blossom.

1865,The Agamemnon Rag,Jack Conway,"Atlas, you’re Homer. I am so glad you’re Hera.    
Thera so many things to tell you. I went on that    
minotaur of the museum. The new display centaurs    
on how you can contract Sisyphus if you don’t use    
a Trojan on your Dictys. It was all Greek to me, see. 
When I was Roman around,    
I rubbed Midas against someone. “Medea, you look like a Goddess,”    
he said. The Minerva him! I told him to    
Frigg off, oracle the cops. “Loki here,” I said.    
“In Odin times men had better manners.” It’s best to try    
and nymph that sort of thing in the bud. He said he knew    
Athena two about women like me, then tried to Bacchus    
into a corner. Dryads I could, he wouldn’t stop.    
“Don’t Troy with my affections,” he said.    
“I’m already going to Helen a hand basket.”    
I pretended to be completely Apollo by his behavior.    
If something like that Mars your day, it Styx with you    
forever. “I’m not Bragi,” he said. “But Idon better.”    
Some people will never Lerna. Juno what I did?    
Valhalla for help. I knew the police would    
Pegasus to the wall. The Sirens went off.    
Are you or Argonaut guilty, they asked.    
He told the cops he was Iliad bad clams.    
He said he accidentally Electra Cupid himself    
trying to adjust a lamp shade. This job has its    
pluses and Minos. The cops figured he was Fulla it.    
He nearly Runic for me. I’m telling you,

1867,Ingathering,Carolyn Kizer,"The poets are going home now,
After the years of exile,
After the northern climates
Where they worked, lectured, remembered,
Where they shivered at night
In an indifferent world.
Where God was the god of business,
And men would violate the poets’ moon,
And even the heavens become zones of war.
 
The poets are going home
To the blood-haunted villages,
To the crumbling walls, still pocked
With a spray of bullets;
To the ravine, marked with a new cross,
Where their brother died.
No one knows the precise spot where they shot him,
But there is a place now to gather, to lay wreaths.
The poets will bring flowers.
 
The poets are coming home
To the cafés, to the life of the streets at twilight,
To slip among the crowds and greet their friends;
Thee young poets, old now, limping, who lean on a cane:
Or the arm of a grandchild, peer with opaque eyes
At the frightening city, the steel and concrete towers
Sprung up in their absence.
Yet from open doorways comes the odor of grapes
Fermented, of fish, of oil, of pimiento…
 
The poets have come home
To the melodious language
That settles in their heads like moths alighting,
This language for which they starved
In a world of gutturals,
Crude monosyllables barked by strangers.
Now their own language enfolds them
With its warm vocables.
The poets are home.
 
Yes, they have come back
To look up at the yellow moon,
Cousin of that cold orb that only reflected
Their isolation.
They have returned to the olives, the light,
The sage-scented meadows,
The whitewashed steps, the tubs of geraniums,
The sere plains, the riverbanks spread with laundry,
The poppies, the vineyards, the bones of mountains.
 
Yes, poets, welcome home
To your small country
Riven by its little war
(As the world measures these events),
A country that remembers heroes and tears;
Where, in your absence, souls kept themselves alive
By whispering your words.
Now you smile at everything, even the priests, the militia,
The patient earth that is waiting to receive you."

1871,October 1973,Carolyn Kizer,"Last night I dreamed I ran through the streets of New York
Looking for help for you, Nicanor.
But my few friends who are rich or influential
were temporarily absent from their penthouses or hotel suites.
They had gone to the opera, or flown for the weekend to Bermuda.
At last I found one or two of them at home,
preparing for social engagements,
absently smiling, as they tried on gown after gown
until heaps of rich, beautiful fabric were strewn
over the chairs and sofas. They posed before mirrors,
with their diamonds and trinkets and floor-length furs.
Smiling at me from the mirror, they vaguely promised help.
They became distracted—by constantly ringing phones,
by obsequious secretaries, bustling in with packages,
flowers, messages, all the paraphernalia,
all part of the uninterruptible rounds of the rich,
the nice rich, smiling soothingly, as they touched their hair
or picked up their phone extensions.
Absently patting my arm, they smiled, “It will be all right.”
 
Dusk fell on the city as I ran, naked, weeping, into the streets.
I ran to the home of Barbara, my friend,
Who, as a young girl, rescued four Loyalist soldiers
from a Spanish prison;
in her teenage sweater set and saddle shoes and knee socks,
she drove an old car sagging with Loyalist pamphlets
across the Pyrenees all the way to Paris without being caught.
And not long ago, she helped save a group of men
from Franco’s sentence of death.
 
In my dream, Barbara telephones Barcelona.
I realize this isn’t quite right,
but I just stand there paralyzed, as one does in dreams.
Then, dimly, from the other end of the line,
through the chatter of international operators,
we hear artillery fire, the faint tones of lost men,
cracked voices singing, “Los Quartros Generales” through the pulsations
of the great, twisted cable under the ocean.
 Agonía, agonía, sueño, fermente & sueño.
 Este es el mundo, amigo, agonía, agonía.
 
“No, Barbara!” I scream. ""We are not back there.
That’s the old revolution. Call up the new one.”
Though I know that, every day,
your friends, Nicanor, telephone Santiago,
where the number rings and rings and rings
with never an answer. And now the rings
are turning into knells:
 
The church bells of Santiago
tolling the funeral of Neruda, his poems looted,
his autobiography stolen, his books desecrated
in his house on Isla Negra.
And among the smashed glass, the broken furniture,
his desk overturned, the ruined books strewn over the floor,
lie the great floral wreaths from the Swedish academy,
the wreaths from Paris, South Asia, the whole world over.
And the bells toll on…
Then I tell Barbara to hang up the phone.
 
She dials the number again, then turns to me, smiling,
smiling like an angel:
“He is there.” Trembling, I take the phone from her,
and hear your voice, Nicanor,
sad, humorous, infinitely disillusioned,
infinitely consoling:
“Dear Carolyn…” It is Nicanor!
And the connection is broken, because I wake up,
in this white room, in this white silence,
                   in this backwater of silence
on this Isla Blanca:
                   Nicanor, Nicanor,
are you, too, silent under the earth,
                   Brother, Brother?"
1872,On Cowee Ridge,Jonathan Williams,"December 13, 1993 ﻿

John Gordon Boyd
died on the birthday
of three remarkable, and remarkably different, writers:
Heinrich Heine, Kenneth Patchen, Ross McDonald
 
John, too, was just as remarkable, blessed with an inherent “graciousness”
and with extraordinary eyes & ears…
 
 
I think of two texts
on the grievous occasion of his death:
 
“Religion does not help me.
The faith that others give to what is unseen,
I give to what I can touch, and look at.
My Gods dwell in temples
made with hands.”
  — Oscar Wilde, in De Profundis
 
 
and two lines in Rainier Maria Rilke,
John’s favorite poet,
that say it all…
 
 Was tun Sie, Gott,
 Wenn ich bin stürbe?
 
“What will you do,
God, when I am dead?”

I. Pan Awakes: Summer Marches In
 
 
               Pan’s
               spring rain
               “drives his victims
               out to the animals
               with whom they become
               as one”—
 
               pain and paeans,

               to be sung
              
 
               II. What the Flowers in the Meadow Tell Me
 
 
               June 6, 1857, Thoreau in his Journal:
 
               A year is made up of a certain series
                and number of sensations and thoughts
                which have their language in nature…
 
                Now I am ice, now
                I am sorrel.
 
              
               Or, Clare, 1840, Epping Forest:
 
                I found the poems in the fields
                And only wrote them down
 
               and
 
               The book I love is everywhere
                And not in idle words
 
               John, claritas tell us the words are not idle,
               the syllables are able
               to turn plantains into quatrains,
              tune raceme to cyme, panicle and umbel to
              form corollas in light clusters of tones…
 
               Sam Palmer hit it:
               “Milton, by one epithet
               draws an oak of the largest girth I ever saw,
               ‘Pine and monumental oak’:
               I have just been trying to draw a large one in
               Lullingstone; but the poet’s tree is huger than
               any in the park.”
 
               Muse in a meadow, compose in
               a mind!
 
 
               III. What the Animals in the Forest Tell Me
 
 
               Harris’s Sparrow—
 
               103 species seen
               by the Georgia Ornithological Society
               in Rabun Gap,
 
               including Harris’s Sparrow, with its
               black crown, face, and bib encircling
               a pink bill
 
 
               It was, I think, the third sighting
               in Georgia, and I should have been there
               instead of reading Clare, listening to
               catbirds and worrying about
                Turdus migratorious that flew
               directly into the Volkswagen and
               bounced into a ditch
 
 
               Friend Robin, I cannot figure it, if I’d
               been going 40 you might be
               whistling in some grass.
 
               10 tepid people got 10 stale letters
               one day earlier,
               I cannot be happy
               about that.
 
 
               IV. What the Night Tells Me
 
 
               the dark drones on
               in the southern wheat fields
               and the hop flowers
               open before the sun’s
               beckoning
 
 
               the end
               is ripeness, the wind
               rises,
               and the dawn says
               yes
 
 
               YES! it says
               “yes”
 
 
 
               V. What the Morning Bells Tell Me
 
 
                Sounds, and sweet aires
                that give delight
                and hurt not—
 
               that, let
               Shakespeare’s
               delectation
               bear us
 
 
 
               VI. What Love Tells Me
 
 
 
               Anton Bruckner counts the 877th leaf
               on a linden tree in the countryside near Wien
               and prays:
 
               Dear God, Sweet Jesus,
               Save Us, Save Us…
 
               the Light in the Grass,
               the Wind on the Hill,
 
               are in my head,
               the world cannot be heard
 
 
               Leaves obliterate
               my  heart,
 
               we touch each other
               far apart…
 
 
               Let us count
               into
               the Darkness"

        I cannot put my hand into
        a cabbage to turn
        on the light, but
 
        the moon moves over
        the field of dark cabbage and an
        exchange fills
        all veins.
 
        The cabbage is also a globe
        of light, the two globes
 
        now two eyes in
        my saturated

        Eight Great Dahlias stood

        They set fire to the Sun
        in a black wood
        beyond the Mountains,
 
        in the Valley of Vision

        In the Valley of Vision
 
        the Fission of
        Flowers
 
        yields all Power

and the sweet-shrub"
1876,What the Bones Know,Carolyn Kizer,"Remembering the past
And gloating at it now,
I know the frozen brow
And shaking sides of lust
Will dog me at my death
To catch my ghostly breath.
 
          I think that Yeats was right,
          That lust and love are one.
          The body of this night
          May beggar me to death,
          But we are not undone
          Who love with all our breath.
 
                     I know that Proust was wrong,
                     His wheeze: love, to survive,
                     Needs jealousy, and death
                     And lust, to make it strong
                     Or goose it back alive.
                     Proust took away my breath.
 
                                 The later Yeats was right
                                 To think of sex and death
                                 And nothing else. Why wait
                                 Till we are turning old?
                                 My thoughts are hot and cold.
                                 I do not waste my breath."
1877,Where I've Been All My Life,Carolyn Kizer,"I.
 
Sirs, in our youth you love the sight of us.
Older, you fall in love with what we’ve seen,
Would lose yourselves by living in our lives.
I’ll spin you tales, play the Arabian girl;
Working close, alone in the blond arena,
Flourish my cape, the cloth on the camera.
For women learn to be a holy show.
 
I’ll tell you where I’ve been, not what I am:
In Rotterdam, womb where my people sprang,
I find my face, my father, everywhere.
New cousins I must stoop to greet, the get
Of tall, whey-colored burghers, sturdy dams,
As children fed on tulip bulbs and dirt,
Tugged at dry dugs and sucked at winter’s rind.
 
My cousins, dwarfed by war! Your forms rebuke
The butcher and the bystander alike.
To ease you I can’t shrink this big Dutch frame
Got of more comfortable ancestors.
But from my Southern side I pluck a phrase,
“I’ll carry you.” And it means “rest in me,”
To hold you as I may, in my mind’s womb.
 
But snap the album, get the guidebook out!
Rotterdam: her raw, gray waterfront,
Zadkine’s memorial burning on the quay;
This bronze is mortal, gaping in defeat,
The form that wombed it split to let it be.
It mends; he lurches up, in blood reborn,
The empty heavens his eternal frame.
 
 
          II.
 
Move to my room beside the Golden Horn
Where minarets strike fire against the sky.
The architecture: breasts and phalluses.
Where are the words to say that words are lies?
Yeats lied. And here Byzantium lies dead.
Constantinople? Syllables in a text.
Istanbul. Real. Embalmed in dancing dust.
 
Everywhere the dark-brown past gives way
To the beige of progress, that wide vacant lot.
Turkey without coffee! Endlessly we sip tea
From bud vases, and I lust for the guide,
A sultry, serious, pedantic boy
In a tight brown suit, thirsting to get out
Of the triple city weighing on his mind.
 
Oh, he was doomed, doomed like the dogs
On Dog Island, in the sea,
Netted and dumped and exiled, left to die,
Then skinned. We heard imaginary canine howls,
Like the rustlings of a thousand gauzy girls,
Film-eyed cattle, perishing of ennui
In abandoned harems where he guided me.
 
Meanwhile the Faithful, prostrate and intoning,
Stare into the light as blind as death,
Knowing for sure their end is instant Heaven.
We Infidels concede them Paradise,
Having seen heaven-as-harem, a eunuch God
In charge: the virgin slowly fattening to blubber.
Love, become feminized, tickles like a feather.
 
The saints of Art? Sophia, that vast barn
Holds no small Savior waiting to get born.
The formal scribble on the assaulted walls—
Five hundred years of crossing out His name!
Some famous, glittering pebbles mark the place
As God’s most grandiose sarcophagus.
Decay, decay. And the mind, a fetus, dies.
 
 
          III.
 
Return me to the airfield near Shanghai
Where I am very young: shy, apprehensive,
Seated like Sheba on a baggage mountain
Waiting for the first adventure to begin.
The train will glide through fields of rice and men,
Bodies like thongs, and glorious genitals,
Not alien as Chinese, but Adam-strange.
 
Rejoiced by her first look at naked men,
Her soul swims out the window of the train!
She goes where newborn daughters clog the creeks;
Bank-porticoes are strewn with starving rags.
Here the old dragon, China, thrashes, dying.
But the ancient, virile music of the race
Is rising, drenched in gongs and howls of dogs
 
Islanded, the sighs of walled-up women
Dreaming of peasants in their prisoning fields…
But we break out of the harem of history!
No longer that young foreigner on the train,
I listen like a bird, although I ruminate
Like a cow, in my pale Holland body, riven
By love and children. These eyes are what they see.
 
 Come die with me in the mosques of Rotterdam."

      When beldams dig clams their fat hams (it’s always beldams) balanced near Tellus’s hide, this rhinoceros pelt, these lumped stone—buffoonery of midges on a bull’s thigh—invoke,—what you will: birth’s glut, awe at God’s craft, youth’s poverty, evolution of a child’s caper, man’s poor inconsequence. Eclipse of all things; sun’s self turned hen’s rump.

  

      Cross a knife and fork and listen to the church bells! It is the harvest moon’s made wine of our blood. Up over the dark factory into the blue glare start the young poplars. They whisper: It is Sunday! It is Sunday! But the laws of the country have been stripped bare of leaves. Out over the marshes flickers our laughter. A lewd anecdote’s the chase. On through the vapory heather! And there at banter’s edge the city looks at us sidelong with great eyes—lifts to its lips heavenly milk! Lucina, O Lucina! beneficent cow, how have we offended thee?

      The brutal Lord of All will rip us from each other—leave the one to suffer here alone. No need belief in god or hell to postulate that much.

Heavy head, heavy arm, heavy dream—: Of Ymir’﻿﻿s flesh the earth was made and of his thoughts were all the gloomy clouds created. Oya!

     Some fools once were listening to a poet reading his
 poem. It so happened that the words of the thing spoke of
 gross matters of the everyday world such as are never
 much hidden from a quick eye. Out of these semblances,
 and borrowing certain members from fitting masterpieces
 of antiquity, the poet began piping up his music, simple
 fellow, thinking to please his listeners. But they getting 
the whole matter sadly muddled in their minds made such
 a confused business of listening that not only were they
 not pleased at the poet﻿’﻿s exertions but no sooner had he
 done than they burst out against him with violent impre
cations.

      It’﻿s all one. Richard worked years to conquer the descending cadence, idiotic sentimentalist. Ha, for happiness! This tore the dress in ribbons from her maid’﻿﻿s back and not spared the nails either; wild anger spit from her pinched eyes! This is the better part. Or a child under a table to be dragged out coughing and biting, eyes glittering evilly. I’﻿﻿ll have it my way! Nothing is any pleasure but misery and brokenness. THIS is the only up-cadence. This is where the secret rolls over and opens its eyes. Bitter words spoken to a child ripple in morning light! Boredom from a bedroom doorway thrills with anticipation! The complaints of an old man dying piecemeal are starling chirrups. Coughs go singing on springtime paths across a field; corruption picks strawberries and slow warping of the mind, blacking the deadly walls—counted and recounted—rolls in the grass and shouts ecstatically. All is solved! The moaning and dull sobbing of infants sets blood tingling and eyes ablaze to listen. Speed sings in the heels at long nights tossing on coarse sheets with bruning sockets staring into the black. Dance! Sing! Coil and uncoil! Whip yourselves about! Shout the deliverance! An old woman has infected her blossomy grand-daughter with a blood illness that every two weeks drives the mother into hidden songs of agony, the pad-footed mirage of creeping death for music. The face muscles keep pace. Then a darting about the compass in a tarantelle that wears flesh from bones. Here is dancing! The mind in tatters. And so the music wistfully takes the lead.

1882,"Mutability [""We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon""]",Percy Bysshe Shelley,"I. 
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; 
    How restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly! yet soon
Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:—

                                         II.
Or like forgotten lyres whose dissonant strings
    Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
    One mood or modulation like the last.

                                        III.
We rest—a dream  has power to poison sleep; 
    We rise—one wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep,
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:—

                                       IV.
It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,
    The path of its departure still is free;
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
    Nought may endure but Mutability."
1883,Peach Fires﻿,David St. John,"Out in the orchards the dogs stood

Almost frozen in the bleak spring night
& Mister dragged out into the rows
Between his peach trees the old dry limbs

Building at regular intervals careful pyres
While the teeth of the dogs chattered & snapped
& the ice began to hang long as whiskers

From the globes along the branches
& at his signal we set the piles of branches ablaze
Tending each carefully so as not to scorch

The trees as we steadily fed those flames
Just enough to send a rippling glow along
Those acres of orchard where that body—

Sister Winter—had been held so wisely to the fire"
1884,1979,Roddy Lumsden,"They arrived at the desk of the Hotel Duncan
and Smithed in, twitchy as flea-drummed squirrels.

Her coat was squared and cream, his patent shoes
were little boats you wouldn’t put to sea in.

People, not meaning to, write themselves in
to the soap that your life is, rise or fall in the plot.

Seems that they were fleeing from the 1980s
much as a hummingbird flies from a flower’s bell.

These were the times when wine was still a treat 
and not yet considered a common bodily fluid.

You will have heard that the mind works much
as an oval of soap turned between two hands.

She went round the room seeking lights
that could be off without desire becoming love.

He spread his arms behind his head, a gesture
of libido she misread as test of temperature.

Every carpet has its weave and underlay, seen 
only by the maker, the deliverer and the layer.

The year was a dog but the day was as good as 
a song that ends with a wedding, meat on the rib.

Evening was folding over the grid, slick walkers
with armfuls of books splendored in dusk’s ask.

The song of the pipes was eerie as a face pressed
to glass, as a basketball with a mouth and teeth.

They lay in the glow of the times and talked of
how people form a queue to exact or escape love.

Each sigh has a sequel, she thought, then he did,
then the whole hotel pulsed through that thought.

Scandal has an inroad, but you must tunnel out;
she rose and stood up counting, all hair and beauty.

Though we do not hear them, beneath our own,
our shadows’ footsteps clatter, they match our dread."
1885,Amidwives: Two Portraits,Todd Boss,"i. a wife will wean

by coming between

her husband 
and the woman who

whelped him. And 
should he bemoan

the sweet taste gone, 
she’ll boast of how she

helped him—helped 
him get beyond

his milks at last, and cut 
from gums beneath

—the better to shake
her memory with—

permanent teeth.

ii. a mother will woo

a married man who 

was once her darling 
son. She can’t conceive

of anyone loving him
through and through

as she has done. She’ll 
do whatever it takes

to test his trust. She’ll 
run a tempered blade

into the marriage 
bed and find the naked 

place where she was 
most betrayed

—and thrust."
1886,Butchers,C. K. Williams,"1 
Thank goodness we were able to wipe the Neanderthals out, beastly things,
from our mountains, our tundra—that way we had all the meat we might need.

Thus the butcher can display under our very eyes his hands on the block,
and never refer to the rooms hidden behind where dissections are effected,

where flesh is reduced to its shivering atoms and remade for our delectation
as cubes, cylinders, barely material puddles of admixtured horror and blood.

Rembrandt knew of all this—isn’t his flayed beef carcass really a caveman?
It’s Christ also, of course, but much more a troglodyte such as we no longer are.

Vanished those species—begone!—those tribes, those peoples, those nations—
Myrmidon, Ottoman, Olmec, Huron, and Kush: gone, gone, and goodbye.

 2 
But back to the chamber of torture, to Rembrandt, who was telling us surely
that hoisted with such cables and hung from such hooks we too would reveal

within us intricate layerings of color and pain: alive the brush is with pain,
aglow with the cruelties of crimson, the cooled, oblivious ivory of our innards.

Fling out the hooves of your hands! Open your breast, pluck out like an Aztec
your heart howling its Cro-Magnon cries that compel to battles of riddance!

Our own planet at last, where purged of wilderness, homesickness, prowling,
we’re no longer compelled to devour our enemies’ brains, thanks to our butcher,

who inhabits this palace, this senate, this sentried, barbed-wire enclosure
where dare enter none but subservient breeze; bent, broken blossom; dry rain."
1887,Craw,Atsuro Riley,"Split the boy       —his thorax, throat
Pierce-peel the craw:

A jag-crystalled crust      —his black scoria, slag
(not Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled)

What no gizzard ground (could hope to grind)
What would not mesh
What would not smelt

Embedded undigested there in meat"
1888,Drycleaners,Dave Smith,"At the drycleaners I stand in line, my feet
shuffling weight from side to side,
impatience all over me while the woman,
light brown, with her Creole story drones on.
In New Orleans none would notice.
She’s exotic in Baltimore, a dawn bird
everything hears. Even the clerk
leans into her tale, clucking softly. When
people behind me cough, she won’t be
rushed. She’s got her whole story to go.
Soon there’s a man she never married,
her mother opposed, far away still, and he
went into a bar, wrong place, wrong color,
wrong words, maybe, a good man.
He’ll never come away of there, not comin’
home, geraniums on the back porch,
and not replace the bad tire her Honda has,
who could always be telling her what time
does in the kitchen if she stand half
naked letting his dog go on out. So
let me pay you for him, give you money
because you is nice and I remember,
her nearly singing voice sighs. The sleeved
pants, two shirts hang on the brass ring, all
finished, unclaimed, the stiffened
stains gone away. The perfectly starched
cloth a redemption so beautiful
it might be the linen of royalty, but small
for a man two of us will think of as 
sleep scuffs house walls like tide under a boat.
How nice they are, these women doing
the little one person can for another
which is, in the end, a wash
of memorable words that leave you standing."
1889,First Storm and Thereafter,Scott Cairns,"What I notice first within 
          this rough scene fixed
in memory is the rare 
          quality of its lightning, as if
those bolts were clipped 
          from a comic book, pasted
on low cloud, or fashioned 
          with cardboard, daubed
with gilt then hung overhead 
          on wire and fine hooks.
What I hear most clearly 
          within that thunder now
is its grief—a moan, a long 
          lament echoing, an ache.
And the rain? Raucous enough, 
          pounding, but oddly 
musical, and, well, 
          eager to entertain, solicitous.

No storm since has been framed 
          with such matter-of-fact 
artifice, nor to such comic 
          effect. No, the thousand-plus 
storms since then have turned 
          increasingly artless, 
arbitrary, bearing—every 
          one of them—a numbing burst.

And today, from the west a gust 
          and a filling pressure
pulsing in the throat—offering 
          little or nothing to make light of."
1890,Genie,Arthur Rimbaud,"He is affection and the present since he opened the house to foaming winter and the hum of summer, he who purified drink and food, he who is the charm of fleeting places and the superhuman deliciousness of staying still. He is affection and the future, strength and love that we, standing amid rage and troubles, see passing in the storm-rent sky and on banners of ecstasy.


      He is love, perfect and reinvented measurement, wonderful and unforeseen reason, and eternity: machine beloved for its fatal qualities. We have all experienced the terror of his yielding and of our own: O enjoyment of our health, surge of our faculties, egoistic affection and passion for him, he who loves us for his infinite life


     And we remember him and he travels. . . And if the Adoration goes away, resounds, its promise resounds: “Away with those superstitions, those old bodies, those couples and those ages. It’s this age that has sunk!”


     He won’t go away, nor descend from a heaven again, he won’t accomplish the redemption of women’s anger and the gaiety of men and of all that sin: for it is now accomplished, with him being, and being loved.


     O his breaths, his heads, his racing; the terrible swiftness of the perfection of forms and of action.


     O fecundity of the spirit and immensity of the universe!


     His body! The dreamed-of release, the shattering of grace crossed with new violence!


     The sight, the sight of him! all the ancient kneeling and suffering 
lifted
 in his wake.


     His day! the abolition of all resonant and surging suffering in more intense music.


     His footstep! migrations more vast than ancient invasions.


     O him and us! pride more benevolent than wasted charities.


     O world! and the clear song of new misfortunes!


    He has known us all and loved us all. Let us, on this winter night, from cape to cape, from the tumultuous pole to the castle, from the crowd to the beach, from glance to glance, our strengths and feelings numb, learn to hail him and see him, and send him back, and under the tides and at the summit of snowy deserts, follow his seeing, his breathing, his body, his day."
1891,In this order,Laura Kasischke,"A tail, a torso, a tiny face.
A longing, a journey, a deep belief.
A spawning, a fissioning, a bit of tissue
anchored to a psyche, 
stitched to a wish. 
Watery. Irony. Memory. My 
mother, my face, and then

the last thing 
she’d ever see, and then
the last words 
I’d hear her say: You’re 
killing me."
1892,Injun Joe as an Avatar,W. S. Di Piero,"The poetry’s arrested in his scene,
which can’t be trusted, because I saw it 
through painkillers that softened my head,
after I’d asked him what Keats really meant:
“Was it a vision or a waking dream?”
—You think that really mattered much to him?
In my waking vision dream, there’s no glory,
no prize committee or dew-drip Paradise.
He’s in an attic nook, or dim garage, 
or the cellar where he actually writes,
the space a sheeted granulated matter, 
his silenced countenance and de-boned body
scabby with caked ash about to crust and crack,  
poems piled at his feet like shoeshine rags.
A grave purpled fraughtness colors him.
What damaged him to this silence? 
He still writes and still isn’t heard, as if
not being heard is the whole point of it,
and who are these children, these waving
Halloween windsocks who won’t talk to him?
Beyond my busybody vision, he staggers
through divorce, stooped, bereft, still writing.
Spiky and singing, he out-writes them all,  
the cheered, spotless others—he howls 
at their after-dinner-speaker poetry,
the monsignors, the suburbans, the woo-woo
wisdom merchants weeping to the bank.
Poetry’s a weather that doesn’t need 
a specific place: it’s a storm outside a cellar,
sunshine at a bedroom window.
Too much schoolroom poisons the idiom.
Too much reverence stinks up the joint.
The sorrow hanging in the dreamy air 
seems to confuse him, he can’t understand 
how his heart came to hurt him like this, 
confuses it with leaves blurted out by storms,
leaves that keep falling fast in the cellar,
in poems he writes, the base desires and rage,
he says the gods designed the set,
stage-manage things, scripted them,
the hilarity that hurts us is 
that none of it really matters,  
that poetry’s griefs are intimates
           we don’t choose.  
                      They come to us, for us. 
                               They cling to body and soul."
1893,It’s That Time,W. S. Di Piero,"The silence of night hours
is never really silent.
You hear the air,
even when it doesn’t stir.
It’s a memory of the day.
Nothing stirs. Memory lags.
No traffic hushing up
and down tricky hills
among the camphor trees.

No foghorns, no streetcars’
shrilling phantoms before
they emerge from tunnels.
These absences keep us alert.
No rain or street voices,
nobody calling to someone else,
Hannah, you walk the dog 
tonight yet or what?

Only certain things to hear:
The sexy shifting of trees,
the refrigerator buzzing 
while Cherubino sings
the best of love is enthusiasm’s
intense abandon, a voice
in song that preys on no one
and is unconscious of its joy."
1894,The Last Days of Summer Before the First Frost,Tim Bowling,"Here at the wolf’s throat, at the egress of the howl,
all along the avenue of deer-blink and salmon-kick
where the spider lets its microphone down
into the cave of the blackberry bush—earth echo,
absence of the human voice—wait here
with a bee on your wrist and a fly on your cheek,
the tiny sun and tiny eclipse.
It is time to be grateful for the breath
of what you could crush without thought,
a moth, a child’s love, your own life.
There might never be another chance.
How did you find me, the astonished mother says
to her four-year-old boy who’d disappeared
in the crowds at the music festival.
I followed my heart, he shrugs,
so matter-of-fact you might not see
behind his words
(o hover and feed, but not too long)

the bee trails turning to ice as they’re flown."
1895,Morning of Drunkenness,Arthur Rimbaud,"O 
my
 good! O 
my
 beautiful! Atrocious fanfare where I won’t stumble! enchanted rack whereon I am stretched! Hurrah for the amazing work and the marvelous body, for the first time! It began amid the laughter of children, it will end with it. This poison will remain in all our veins even when, as the trumpets turn back, we’ll be restored to the old discord. O let us now, we who are so deserving of these torments! let us fervently gather up that superhuman promise made to our created body and soul: that promise, that madness! Elegance, knowledge, violence! They promised us to bury the tree of good and evil in the shade, to banish tyrannical honesties, so that we might bring forth our very pure love. It began with a certain disgust and ended—since we weren’t able to grasp this eternity all at once—in a panicked rout of perfumes.


      Laughter of children, discretion of slaves, austerity of virgins, horror in the faces and objects of today, may you be consecrated by the memory of that wake. It began in all loutishness, now it’s ending among angels of flame and ice.


     Little eve of drunkenness, holy! were it only for the mask with which you gratified us. We affirm you, method! We don’t forget that yesterday you glorified each one of our ages. We have faith in the poison. We know how to give our whole lives every day.


     Behold the time of the 
Assassins
."
1896,Mushrooms,Laura Kasischke,"Like silent naked monks huddled
around an old tree stump, having
spun themselves in the night
out of thought and nothingness—

And God so pleased with their silence
He grants them teeth and tongues.

Like us.

How long have you been gone?
A child’s hot tears on my bare arms."
1897,Ovid in America,Averill Curdy,"George Sandys (1578–1644), translator of Ovid’s Metamorphosis Englished, Mythologized, and Represented in Figures, and resident treasurer of the Virginia Company for its settlement at Jamestown (1621–1624).

 i. a long voyage, 1621 
I left you where you are:
A humming late summer afternoon
& mottled by shade a man reading a letter
Becomes the image of a man reading
That I am forgetting.
This page is small yet stout enough 
To bear me whole upon it to you
All the way in London. I may expand 
Myself at leisure then fold it tight,
A sanctuary;
Like our vessel christened The George,
My letter is another ark to preserve me: George.

No midnight is so private as the sea’s:
Timbers breathe, a loose rope snaps, & as the wind
Shoves you behind then slaps your face,
Seeing nothing, nothing to be seen, you feel
Unhoused, evicted from time.
But tonight, my love, my lamp is feathered, shy, 
Herald of the next ransack & assail. 
Behold the storm petrel! gray wick-threaded throat 
Burning the oil secreted, an amber musk
Of uncompassed seas & the solitary hunt, 
Of error & sign, &
That delirium—which turned
Our ship’s boy to mowing fields of Atlantic salt.
Like windrows he dropped the waves. 

Until gaffed, pulled like a sleeve 
Through himself, 
He will live, tongue-bit, torn.
To return likely to a stool set on the shale
Where he can mend nets skirted by braggarts
Who have never traveled farther
Than the smoke dribbling from their chimneys.
I try never to imagine drowning.
Noisy urgent inefficiencies above, waves 
Pummeling, sky shredding, & the body
Anchored only in its just longing for air.
The tighter death’s embrace, the more languorous
The moment. So this boy suffered
Some vast charity of sight. 
He was what he saw, an adam. 
Now he may be adamant & stain & distance; 
& also that small satin interruption
Of terror—the instant breath’s 
Orphaned by self’s perishing through poetry. 
Like Daphne his voice is forfeit for the song,
But we do not grieve for Daphne.

My bird-light gutters. 
Its call had sounded
Like dry wood giving up a nail.

What is this your wound that you must follow it?
For you I had no answer; consider only the reveries
Of the carpet navigator in his room. Listening
To collisions of wave & star outside his tower,
Rock-rapt, icebound, with a mind by dread 
& ceremony & the dozen arts of courtesy 
Girded, he invented those ideal earths in latitudes
Unstrung that I now trespass—

After I had translated two books 
To the pouring of seas & clamor of sailors
I began to brood long on landlessness, 
Coming to believe it my sovereign, my home, 
When on the flat horizon of weeks at noon the flaw:
A color merely, private, ethereal, collecting
Heft in the warp of time. Days 
Before we quailed at the barbed illegible pelt
Of forest, I wrecked, forlorn upon its savor,
Sweet damage of apples 
Fermenting in rain-soaked hay,
Giving way to something ranker—
I tasted it at dinner lying on my tongue.
I am His Majesty’s servant as my god made me;
I am also my damps & exaltations; I am afraid.

Heaven & hell enlisted their geographers, 
A map has opened the soul’s five hinges, & Persian
With expectance how often have I feasted 
On departure. London, Naples, 
Marriage, Damascus, now your dear person.
So much flowing through me
My sight has silted dark my mouth. I beg
All the many tongues your wonder cabinet holds
—Dolphin, mockingbird, Muscovy bear—to tell
This arrival, so unforeseen, disorderly 
As my hope you will not forget who I was, & am,
Unwildered, unwestered, constant, returning.

Bless you where you are, & where you would be
When you are there, & bring you thither.
                                          My love,
What may never not be strange? What,
This morning, will wake & make me new.

 ii. winter 1621 

It begins like a legend told to a fretful child:
It was, it was, and it was not. It begins
As if with symptoms of that sweat
I hear, so late (oh not
Thank God too late), you were spared:
A little blush along the throat. A restlessness.
Then the silkworm’s casement, tapering 
& pale as the egg of a chimney-swift,
Which we will convert to cloth 
To cover the naked Indian. A bobbin,
Which dropped in my tisane would ravel the maelstrom
Of silk. Spindle of whirlwind, spoonful
Of follow. The thread’s stained scalding mile 
Pours out my glass tempered in our kiln,
As each new settler is also seasoned
In this furnace, our new-found land.
(As the man drowning believes he digests
The mild water, as the damned marry flame
& yet blister, so do I know myself
Grasped by change at the stroke of change.)
Hold this glass up to your eye & through
Its pebbled horizon you may spy your room,
See its ire of surfaces sore with chairs. 
Green grass green grace...
Would that I could account this world one
Where nothing is lost only exchanged.

Without coppice, park, romancely glade, 
Or commanding vantage, 
Woods press on us; they fester, 
& they watch. To the northeast white spruce,
Phalanxes of fledging pinions, clamp 
Root to granite & hoard
What they glean off salt-fog, sea-spray, & stone. 
From ewers of willow-oaks darkness steams.
At breakfast I have pinched the plantlets 
Insinuated by a maple’s winged seed overnight;
It unclasps twin leaves, pale hands 
Loosening the soil of my rest,
They never empty of their solicitations.

I find no empires here, no apostles or emeralds.
Instead, all things a-broil with an awful begetting
& my hours unsettled by some new show
Of riotous & mystical imagination.
Though we might wish to wedge us barnacle-tight
To shore’s edge, our foundation raised
On marshland recalls this irritable fact—
The estuary, a nursery of strange devices, 
Throws off new forms so promiscuously
I wonder how the world holds any more shape
Than a dream?

From my hand at night (my light
A little oil in a dish or a rush taper smoking
Not so different from his), flower 
Ovid’s fantastic shapes, shadows 
Of an old empire’s former splendor
Now perjured by Virginia’s clay & leaf & sand 
Turned to the king’s profit as iron, silk, & glass.
Belief is possible at night, solitary, firelit.
Then, I can believe in Ovid’s centaurs,
Or at death that he was met by a three-headed dog.
I can believe in your letters, which never come.

It is for you that I persist
In translating fresh birdsong, like this bunting’s
Comecomecome wherewherewhere 
All together      down the hill. 
(Where did they go, who went before us?
Starved trove: scatter of blue beads & a name
Grafted to that bald acre. 
Roanoke.
There is my terror & my tale: to go west 
Under this eternity of nameless trees.)

And what will you make of this 
Humble hieroglyphic of nature I forward to you?
Nocturnal, double-wombed, variously called
Monkey Fox; Frosted,
Or Short-headed, or Indolent.
Let this Leafy-Eared Rat-Tailed Shuffler
The naturals call Possoun 
Join your zoo’s other fantasies 
& with the Little Military Learnéd Horse 
Enjoy its dish of ale. Its fur is durable;
Its flesh wholesome, white, & pleasant.

With one hand I can reach for
A medicine man’s last breath caught in a vial
Or a hummingbird, stuffed 
With arsenic & leaves & looking 
Like a fine jeweled dagger aimed at my heart, 
With the other hand I brush away 
The web spun in a fox skull’s whitened socket 
While a wild turkey glowers from its corner
Like a small dyspeptic dragon.
My cullings do not quite master my closet.
When I imagine myself returned to the smells
& noise of London, from my stiff knee
Sands grinding as I walk, no marvels
Except those which the mirror surprises in all of us,
The swan-white wing at my temple, 
I do not know what to hope for:
That you do not see me, or that you do,
But as though I were pinned under glass.

At my windowsill a quince widens
A jaundiced eye into the dark where are
Real nettles beneath the words & invincible red
Root of the madder. 
As long as any image of this world
Sticks in my soul, I remain—

 iii. spring1622 
300 were murdered. Twice that 
Refuse to garden, hunt, or gather food
But languish like sparrows sunk in a frozen pond
Staring up at shadows, awaiting
The sign that will call them back to life.
They cannot imagine their future. 
Haunts without words to tell their trial; like Io,
We would flee the noise of our new voices.

Last night’s sun smeared across the sky
Its customary rose-gold gore. You, 
In London, you have applauded no tragedy 
Your approximate heart might use to figure this—
This violence. The trees
Do not desist their manufacture.
The perfumier’s corky bitch 
Chewed out the tendon in her master’s wrist 
Until it inelastic snapped & back she bowled,
Off to the woods & not sniffed since. 

With the smell of breakfast still in the air, 
The aftertaste of lead was the scandal
Of blood. Bodies stung into postures,
Penitence, Weariness, Surprise, & cardinal
In red caps, red garlands of red roses
Wrapped around white throats, white 
As bacon fat. No one need travel any longer
For all have found what they sought:
Henry walks his own fields, Lucy is not afraid,
Will has finally grasped the subjunctive.
The dead do not look asleep.
We cannot sleep through this life.
I watch the flies at their devotions, & I learn.

Time will not end by water or fire,
But by a congregation of frogs who yelp like hounds
& ride each other in shallow plashes.
I am inhabited by things that wake me,
But do not show themselves.

One frog my hand holds like a swollen glove.
As your maid might pare a callous,
I trim the brief cloudburst of its brain,
Which has the texture of cheese under my knife.
The frog, insensate, blind as an idol,
Would sit until it starved. 
If I put Ovid between it & the window, 
Tickle its hinderparts with acid, it leaps
Towards the light, avoiding the book.
Its movements finical as a rope-dancer. 
Though she have her heart & liver pulled out
Another frisks & fidgets up & down. 
              
Who am I so far from home? 

A year—& through branches light comes,
A pilgrim out of March from a farther world.
There is a flaw in the air. I breathed it 
From the swamp, a kiss of damp 
Translated to a plague that would remote me 
From care & corroding solicitudes, crown me 
With this headdress of red-painted deer-hair 
& weight my ears with wheels of copper.
My face painted blue & silver, my body
Washed in crimson dye, they would greet me
First with lamentations to mourn my old life,
Then by psalms I could enter
Purged & reborn & singing in a tongue 
Not mine I know not where to go. (I know.)"
1898,Packing the Car for Our Western Camping Trip,Jane Varley,"What we will remember—we tried to take the dog,
packed around him, making a cozy spot
at the back of the Subaru, blocking out the sun,
resisting the obvious—
he was too old, he would not make it.
And when he died in Minnesota,
we smelled and smelled his paws,
arthritic and untouchable these last many years,
took those marvelous paws up into our faces.
They smelled of dark clay
and sweet flower bloom decay."
1899,Rondeau,Laura Kasischke,"Small and panting mass
Of moonlight and dampness on a log
This glistening tumor, terrible frog
Of moonlight and dampness on a log
My small and panting mass"
1900,Royalty,Arthur Rimbaud,"One fine morning, in the country of a very gentle people, a magnificent man and woman were shouting in the public square. “My friends, I want her to be queen!” “I want to be queen!” She was laughing and trembling. He spoke to their friends of revelation, of trials completed. They swooned against each other.


      In fact they were regents for a whole morning as crimson hangings were raised against the houses, and for the whole afternoon, as they moved toward groves of palm trees."
1901,So It Goes,W. S. Di Piero,"That marsh hawk,
its blown-leaf flight 
across Tomales Bay fog, 
summer’s abraded light,
the Pacific tide pressuring
and squeezing wave on wave 
into the bay’s pinched inlet. . .
We feel somehow between us
still water crushed by that sea,
so constant it seems not to be.
The hawk, a circus, tumbles,
stops, stands upon the air,
beats its wings as if to shoo 
the sun’s drenched veils, 
and its clapping wings stop
our unstoppable argument,
that love goes, who knows why,
and delivers us from pain 
to pain, air with teeth 
that seems to eat more air.  
Northern harrier, owl face, 
they sea-changed your name,
who listens with your face
and shows not love but want, 
speed, life in flight 
toward, forever toward,
pausing at every chance
to use what ocean-born
bayside air sustains you
by resisting you. We thank
your sunken head bones
and wild close-to-water seeking
that somehow speaks to us,
           delivers us 
                    to another amazed 
                              agonized place."
1902,Spitwads,Michael McFee,"Little paper cuds we made
by ripping the corners or edges
from homework and class notes
then ruminating them into balls
we’d flick from our fingertips
or catapult with pencils
or (sometimes after lunch)
launch through striped straws
like deadly projectiles
toward the necks of enemies
and any other target where they’d
stick with the tiniest splat,
I hope you’re still there,
stuck to unreachable ceilings
like the beginnings of nests
by generations of wasps
too ignorant to finish them
or under desktops with blunt
stalactites of chewing gum,
little white words we learned
to shape and hold in our mouths
while waiting to let them fly,
our most tenacious utterance."
1903,Sunder,Atsuro Riley,"A last rock-skip hurlstorm (crazing river-glass)

1904,Theories of the Soul,Karen An-hwei Lee,"A true friend is one soul in two bodies. 
—Aristotle

Kant says, transcendental
    idealism. In Aquinas,

we exist apart from bodies
    but only on Thursdays

when his famous ox
    flies by the window

wiser at Cologne
    where Albertus Magnus,

his real name, appoints
    Aquinas to magister studentium,

master of students. Aquinas
    is petrified but says yes.

He feels his soul
    sailing out of his head

floating near the roof
    where a blue ox wings by.

On Wednesday, two bodies
    are one soul

waking at sunrise
    thanks to the pineal gland

of Descartes, who thinks
    this node in the brain

is a tiny sugar cone
    or salted peanut,

the seat of the soul
    while Aristotle points

to the chopping
    ax as a teleology

as if the ax were a living,
    breathing person

which it isn’t.
    Heraclitus, air and fire

while Aquinas objects, no
    not an ax but ox.

If you’re a bird or soul
    I am only one mile

from the sea. If you
    are a soul in two bodies

life is more complex
    and we must labor

twice the field of sorrow
    after sleep, bath, and a glass

as Aquinas whispers, the things
    we love tell us who we are."
1905,To a Reason,Arthur Rimbaud,"A tap of your finger on the drum releases all sounds and initiates the new harmony.


      A step of yours is the conscription of the new men and their marching orders.


     You look away: the new love!


     You look back,—the new love!


     “Change our fates, shoot down the plagues, beginning with time,” the children sing to you. “Build wherever you can the substance of our fortunes and our wishes,” they beg you.


     Arriving from always, you’ll go away everywhere."
1906,What’s Left,W. S. Di Piero,"How often now, raging weeping for the days
love gives then takes away, takes from you
the slightly chapped hand laid on the one
you’re pointing at a tree, and the voice 
that breathes coffeeberry bush into your mouth.  
The finger that taps and feathers your ear
but the giggle’s gone before you turn around.
The sandalwood scent hanging in the room,
the auburn strand like a flaw in the porcelain,
the off-course nail clipping in the carpet.
The days eat into your stomach, knife you
with longing for relief from love
that you cannot leave or leave alone,
from its rings of fire where you won’t
burn down to ash or be transformed.
You become them, and they keep burning
and have a coffeeberry voice.
           Listen how
                     their rhymes sing
                               the little deaths you live."
1907,Yeast,Roddy Lumsden,"A word you can’t quite say
without itching, flinching; it’s not easy
to ignore its squirming appetite, stay
your primal juddering. And yes, at
night, each microbe gurns in the salty sea
of gut and gullet, born again, boldly eats
as you ate it, brews its own queasy tea
of proto-raunch which it will quickly sate,
birthing wanderlusting vigors, as yet
unknown to microscience. They sashay, set
out for the toes or gape through your eyes at
your drooping lids, your fat bunch of keys, at
this internal motel’s boss, bellhop, lackey, sat
in the throne of his slumber, a mercy seat."
1908,The Bride of Frank,Aaron Shurin,"We were application — aerial shapes investigating their causes as they unfolded their wandering life — possessed of temper, parents, talent, fancy — in books in which characters redeem being from the hands of infidels. I feel soaring pleasure.


 


When I was thirteen I opened my father — title page of my book —to explain exploded powers warmed by a glance. To penetrate the ocean behind the elements and give names — fidelity — from a stream of fire reduced to electricity — over the malignity of an alarming bed — the brightness of a familiar eye commences connection: These are the faces cooped up in one place, and his sweetest voice hiding how the blood circulates, and my peculiar trembled body, the seat of beauty.


 


At the end of two years every object inherited human feelings. I paused and brain exemplified generation. His child pursuing these reflections. My pale cheek and tremendous secrets of fingers.


 


Winter, spring passed — watch the blossom — it breathed hard —convulsive muscles of pearly whiteness — with his watery eyes disturbed by the first kiss traversing my bedchamber. His eyes held up the curtain of the bed. I remained listening, unfinished. My food its white steeple drenched by the rain.


 


We ascended into my room, putting my hands before my eyes —tingle — save me and save me — anticipated with such nervous joy I became capable of shooting forth from the trees — it was a divine spring — that night drawing me out I felt the sensations of others.


 


When shown the body they saw permission — I believe in innocence notwithstanding temptation — whom you loved was a creature who’d fill the air with birds serving you — feelings worked up by events — to wean us fro our future prospects towards a tenderness of fainting limbs, a type of me. I was encompassed by a bodily cloud. I remained rushing at the window.


 


They congregated around me, the unstained pinnacle. I arrived at the same lulling sounds: the giver of oblivion. The ascent is solemn, curling in wreaths — I sat upon the glittering peaks — swelled with sunlight over your narrow beds. I beheld the figure of a man at some distance. As he approached a mist came over my eyes. You are community. Instinctively lying down I covered myself with little winged animals, light from my eyes. Spreading my cloak I covered the ground. One part was open.


 


It was a paradise filled with milk. Uttering a few sounds the young man had been filled up. I awoke into my voice by his means — sun on the red leaves — mounted high in the heavens using gesticulations and a gush of tears. Feelings of kindness and gentleness overcame me. Fringed by deep lashes, I contemplated my companion…"
1909,Burroughs,Robert Glück,"fleshes  his dirty  rotten  hunka  tin   I  am  right   strapped  into  head  electrodes   he sticks a gun in teen age drug   Harry S Truman decided to drop first   I am right   sequence   repeat   dim  jerky  far  away smoke   cop rat bares his yellow teet   kicks in the door   I am right   survivors burned   time and place   he throws atom bomb   knocks man to floor   you are wrong you are wrong   he was looking for are wrong   Breaks through door I’m poli   outside bar   Hiroshima   has strayed into Dillinger’s right   is making a difficult decision   right   survivors burned   mixed you child I am he kicks him into 1914 movie   if you are gay I am right   wrong   executioner   officer   I am cop   right enough you are I am right   right   wrong Pentagon   dim jerky far away smoke.


 


I cut up his cut-ups, allegory of an allegory of an allegory of an allegory of a waterfall of mental curlicues whose new meaning is no meaning in extremity. Is a Burroughs to eat? I am timid, abstract, complete, light fever, timid. Barefoot, yells Hey Pop, got any more Dick Tracys?  Burroughs am paying one wrecked penny for the pleasure he’s wreaking on some “boy”; shooting quarts of toxins,  skin a welcome  mat,  body  heroically disjunct Picasso  (two profiles,  left  front  high…).  The stapled urge for self-protection that…Danger is a refuge from more danger. Don’t even know what a Burroughs is.


 


Manhattan Project, first atom bomb test, New Mexico 1945: Oppenheimer and 
his
 boys think the planet could go critical. Oppenheimer refigures, the probability remains, “What the  hell.” So-and-so many blasts: radioactive sex causes untold genetic mutations. A carnival of giants, vile luminosity sheeting off their scales and exoskeletons, march out of that desert looking for something to eat. I don’t want to die but witness APPETITE and MURDER tread the vile luminous sand: ant spider Gila monster rattler wasp rat locust lizard grasshopper rabbit praying mantis crow ant spider wasp…The entire town of Soda Bluff stampedes down narrow canyons scattering funeral lights beneath their trembling feet. The destruction of today. Last men, mercenaries on the last patrol, eat rations with dog mouths, then fool around in caustic green dusk; they wear Mylar capes and copper-studded jockstraps. Bud’s withheld a basket musta weigh two pounds of fresh peaches. Bud squirms down with a deep sigh, odor of penetration, he says, “I want to be so 
embraced
.” The last ant cold mandibles his thigh, a howl and spasms from Bud’s lifted body mean death. I send my own spear into the enormous insect eye shattering a thousand selves —point touched pinpoint brain, blue sparks, burning isolation, burning rubber, ant collapses, cold heap of old parts. The reason Bud dies, so that his orgasm stays beyond. I don’t wonder 
who
 I am, I wonder 
where
 I am—still, nothing to do now but kick back and wait for orders."

Make it
the place
it was then,
 
so full it split
vision to live
there in winter
 
so late & wet
abundance
toppled toward
 
awful—birds
of paradise
a profusion
 
the ripe colors
of anodized
metal; in gutters
 
umbrellas
smashed
like pigeons,
 
bent ribs bright
among black
slack fluttering;
 
camellias’
pink imagoes
dropping
 
into water
& rotting,
sweet stink—
 
& did not
stop :
the inundated
 
eye, over-
populous
urban eye,
 
the whole
place, to look
at it, was
 
a footprint
in January :
everywhere
 
cloudy water
rising to fill in
the outlines,
 
& meanwhile
indoors differed
by degree
 
alone : without
love, loosed
from God,
 
there were
lovers & touch
rushing in
 
to redraw
your boundaries
constantly
 
because
it was a tune
you kept
 
getting wrong,
the refrain
of what it meant
 
to live alone,
months of that
and then 
 
.
 
sudden summer, sheer release, streets all cigarettes & sashay,
   balls-out tube tops, low-riders & belly fat, the girls on the block
 
all like Oh no she didn’t, and girl, she did, she was mad skills
   with press-ons & a cell phone telling him where to stick it, a kid
 
on her hip, just like that, summer, sheer beauty & lip gloss
   that smelled like peaches, & you going to the store for whiskey
 
& condoms like everyone else on a hot, long afternoon
   so long & hot it would just be sunburn to walk anywhere if it weren’t also
 
a pleasure, thoughtless & shiftless & horny & drunk,
   just someone thinking summer wasn’t up to anything deep, & lo
 
there he was, his punk ass pink as a Viking in a tight
   wifebeater & lingering by the public pool, drinking beer so sly
 
it didn’t look illegal, & he wasn’t a good idea but
   did you have a light? & it seemed the whole summer went like that,
 
taking fire out of your pocket & giving it away, a ditty
   you could whistle it was so cliché, like the numbers they gave you after
 
& you never called, the number of swollen nodes of the kissing
   colds you got & later the number to call to get tested, the number of the bus
 
to the clinic, the number they gave you when they asked
   you to wait, the number of questions asked, number of partners, number
 
of risks, number of previous tests, the number of pricks
   —one—to draw the blood, the number of minutes you waited before
 
results, & then you decided you had to get the tune right,
   the how to live it so it doesn’t kill you, to take a number & wait in the long line
 
of the city’s bankrupt humanism like the bus that never comes
   no matter how long you wait, & the grocery bag breaking, & if you were going
 
to sing that one, the one that sounds like all I got is bruised
   tomatoes, broken glass & dirty bread & no one waiting at home, would you

.
 
start with genius,
as in, the spirit
of a place?,
 
& small, as in
of the back, wet
in heat
 
& the urge
to touch him
there, skin
 
just visible
between his jeans
& t-shirt,
 
to see if
he’s sweating,
to see
 
if he feels
what you feel?,
& if he does,
 
is that all
the spirit the place
will give,
 
a small thing
shared, just
a phrase, not
 
a whole song,
but something
to build on?,
 
& if it isn’t bread
& if it sure
ain’t tomatoes
 
it isn’t empty,
is it, like the signage
you walk by
 
that fronts
the Lakeside
Church of Practical
 
Christianity,
hawking
a knowledge of God
 
so modest
it seems trivial?,
& it isn’t ever,
 
is it, the how
to live it
so it doesn’t
 
kill you,
the where
to touch it,
 
the when
will genius
sing your name
 
so it sounds
like a place
you can live?"
1911,Grave,Justin Chin,"In the harsh glare of an easily


reprehensible life. The channel changer is lost


in the crack of an infinite sofa.


       Everything falls apart, everything breaks


down, torn into a million


              fragments, Jericho everyday.


 


I want to be the blameless


victim in this canceled puppet show,


the marionette every mother loves, the one


souvenirs are modeled from.


 


               (In that lifetime, Elton John will write mushy ballads just


               for me. Michael Jackson will want to be my best friend. He’d


               take me to the Neverland Ranch, and by the llama feeding trough,


               he’d say something like, “You’re a great guy, don’t give up,


               stay positive!” And I’d say, “Michael, you fucking idiot, I 
am


               positive!” And he’d say, “Oh, you’re so funny! Would you like


               to touch Bubbles?”


               And I would.)


 


In the crux of my hollow innocent youth,


I believed that my teddy bears had feelings.


       To cure me of this, my guardians made me give


them to the church missionaries’ children.


Scrubbed-clean rosy-cheeked blonde kids who smelled


of sweat and talc, who were in constant


wide-blue-eyed bewilderment as to why


they were profusely perspiring in the tropics,


instead of living out some winter wonderland Bobsey Twins


fantasy, who were oblivious


to their parents’ desperate efforts


to save the dusky masses, ignorant enough


to believe in the secret lives of stuffed animals.


               I could not eat animal crackers


because I did not want to hurt the poor things;


but, braised the right way, I could eat


any part of a pig, starting with the head,


working on the soft flesh around the eyes,


savoring its raspy tongue with a dipping


sauce of ginger, chilies and lime.


 


Oh blameless innocent victim.


What measures a lifetime?


 


I used to have this theory about how


much life a human body could hold.


It all had to do with the number


of heartbeats. Each human is assigned a number


determined by an unknown power cascading


over the dark waters of the unformed Earth.


 


       For some, it was a magnificently high number,


seen only in Richie Rich comics, and for others,


it was frightfully low, like twenty-six.


               No bargaining, no coupons,


no White Flower Day sale, no specials. Once


you hit your number, you croak.


                           I imagined the angels in heaven


and the demons in hell gathering to watch


the counters turn, like how I enjoyed watching


the speedometer line up to a row of similar


numbers, and especially when the row of


nines turned into


                           the row of zeros.


 


Oh blameless innocent victim.


What measures eternity?


 


An eternal damnation. An everlasting love.


 


I could not imagine the night sky


stretched out forever, so I decided that it came


to an end at some point, by a velvet rope it ended


and beyond that rope were row after row of cushioned seats,


       a majestic cosmic theater,


playing every movie I can remember.


 


I want to be able to evoke


those blameless and innocent days, to revel


in their ignorance and goodness


as if they have the power


       to protect and to heal,


and to strengthen,


and to bring me to safety


       long after all other resources


               were exhausted.


 


But I emerge anew in the wreckage,


blinking in the sunlight,


 


the residue of salt water in my belly.


 


You know what they say,


God never closes a door before making sure


that the windows are barricaded


and the fire escape is inaccessible.


 


I used to know how to stop the revolution of planets.


 


I used to know how to save the world.


 


Now, I don’t know anything anymore."
1912,Now I'm a Woman,Cedar Sigo,"When you hear the knives ring
Turn the page.
I wonder why I am not
Myself of late, ridiculous glass edges
Turn back on themselves
And soon reveal
The hand of an apprentice
And godforsaken embarrassing torch,
Stormy back hallways
Out of the black and wooden theatres.
Crystal Waters plus her driver
Plus her entourage is still rolling out
Of the Sands, Atlantic City
On the soundtracks to shows
Held over at The Fairmount
She is throwing back shots
With the mafia. I have learned
To take apart this American Songbook
And very fortunately as I would take
My audience in confidence
Threads of gold fall closely together
Coming to break us off.
At the first of the shows
I sang this song
And in between I saw him in the hall,
What could I tell you?
“Someday we’ll build on a hilltop high.”"
1913,Oh God,Michelle Tea,"spilling water from my back,

breathless and no i didn’t run

another awkward hug in the car
as my face smashes your cheek
that i can feel it leaving now
is the saddest, a beautiful eruption
you could have picked it off the tree

but you weren’t hungry.
feeling it dying away all day
much worse than the straining
against the leash, another gorgeous
thing that should not have happened,
gone again."
1914,Proportion Surviving,Renee Gladman,"Long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. I would wake in the mornings—I would perform something. For example, the day I tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won another—that whole time I had been living like someone. Though I can’t remember his name. His model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that I inhabit in time of need. This time the need was surprising. People tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. And apples take their shape naturally. The guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others’ concerns as mine to make at home. I was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. When my friends came by—they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what I needed and planning to force it on me—I had to tell them I was busy with my juice. Two weeks before the crisis, I had been writing some poems about it. It was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in San Francisco. People were on the street. Pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. The poems I had written were failures, but dense ones. It seemed appropriate to think the person’s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. I had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can’t help but enjoy. That day I had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. I awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something—not anything life threatening, but definitely personal.


 


My lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. She had no ostensible reaction to the city’s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. In a world where a person’s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, I could not find four people who cared. I thought that if I could find those four people we could really do something. A few of my friends pretended they were chosen. A few neighbors felt bad and made offers. My mother called to console me. My lover—in actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. Sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. The rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. So I kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. If by morning I could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. Before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. But after the apples were gone. The landscape usually contains the solution to what’s lost. Demographics help people in cars. Some people did not notice me. Some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. That was two days before. The evening before it was two days before the crisis, I was thinking that I did not think I was asleep. I had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate’s cat in it. When I looked again, there was no light—but I had not been asleep. It’s the way people react to traumatic events. They say, “I had just been there” or will say, “She was just with me.” So the loss of light was emotional and the lost state—demographic. I began to trace things by their disappearance. Alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. People like to talk about the daytime. People in strange moods often miss the daytime. Before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. I had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. I was happy. I mean, I was in my juice.


 


Five weeks before the crisis, I was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. I did not really work there, but I went there every week. All but the third Sunday of each month, I would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. Not to buy, but to stand next to. Shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. That was one thing. I would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn’t see. I had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. My parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. My father would always say, “If you’re not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do.” He was surprised that with all the time I had on my hands, I chose to spend most of it alone. Numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. For years I had known that if there was a wall between where I was and where I needed to be, I did not want it there. Some people have personal goals that are demanding. Certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. My decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. I would have to leave most friendships behind. As a way of keeping my life “wall-free,” I had to divide my time. I would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. The second part of my day I would spend telling people about the first part. The other parts are not of substance here.


 


Twenty-five years before the crisis I had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. Twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. I am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says.


 


In the first years of my life, everything I ate was mush. Today I will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. When I had that remarkable glass of apple juice, I had no idea that one day I simply would not be able to find it. The city gets rid of its apples. People find themselves inventing fruit. The day I decided to write poems about it—it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage—I had been resting in my best friend’s easy chair. We were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. Five days later I had twenty poems. When a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. The passions overwhelm the body. She carries the body as though it were the book. The friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though I miss her it was the failures that saved me. On every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. If certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. The person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly.


 


In the alley behind the natural foods grocery, I met my second lover for the first time. Meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. Or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. And the weather was so hot during the crisis. Only the alleys had shade. Forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, I had to make a run for the alley. Not as though people were after me, but the elements. The foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. When I appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. Women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things—I thought about telling her, or—short women make me want things. All the time while I was growing up I put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. I did not forget it, but was embroiled. The newspapers were saying things about the past. People were celebrating thick juice, and I kept writing those poems. That day in the alley I realized three things about life. While assisting her I learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. For six months during the crisis, I did not care about the crisis.


 


When my faith returned all my lovers were gone. That morning I woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; I was beneath my bed. It was the sixth day that I had awakened beneath my bed. I was lonely, but I was also sure. Life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, who—when we passed on the street—did not know me. I knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. Today all my ideas are liquid. That day of my faith, friends thinking I was sick came by to see me. It would be the last day I spent alone; I was happy, but still would not drink. The juice on my mind was no longer juice. There was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. I did not want to drink it."
1915,Scarecrow on Fire,Dean Young,"We all think about suddenly disappearing.
The train tracks lead there, into the woods.
Even in the financial district: wooden doors
in alleyways. First I want to put something small
into your hand, a button or river stone or
key I don’t know to what. I don’t
have that house anymore across from the graveyard
and its black angel. What counts as a proper
goodbye? My last winter in Iowa there was always
a ladybug or two in the kitchen for cheer
even when it was ten below. We all feel
suspended over a drop into nothingness.
Once you get close enough, you see what
one is stitching is a human heart. Another
is vomiting wings. Hell, even now I love life.
Whenever you put your feet on the floor
in the morning, whatever the nightmare,
it’s a miracle or fantastic illusion:
the solidity of the boards, the steadiness
coming into the legs. Where did we get
the idea when we were kids to rub dirt
into the wound or was that just in Pennsylvania?
Maybe poems are made of breath, the way water,
cajoled to boil, says, This is my soul, freed."

1917,Your Voice,Francisco Aragón,"Amazing the mood it's put me in.
And the sky's tint at this hour—out
on my own, occasional hum or zip

of a car, August the summer month
half the city splashes about
the Mediterranean, or north:

the beach at Donostia a jewel
—its Paseo the lip of a shell to walk.
It's hearing you what really pulls

me in, soft this interior punch,
recalling the sheen of your brow—we'd talk
with our limbs, the Liffey below, have lunch...

Re-lived this evening on the phone;
the pitch of your Dublin tone.

1921,Home,Kazim Ali,"My father had a steel comb with which he would comb our hair.
 
After a bath the cold metal soothing against my scalp, his hand cupping
my chin.
 
My mother had a red pullover with a little yellow duck embroidered
on it and a pendant made from a gold Victoria coronation coin.
 
Which later, when we first moved to Buffalo, would be stolen from
the house.
 
The Sunn’i Muslims have a story in which the angels cast a dark mark
out of Prophet Mohammad’s heart, thus making him pure, though the
Shi’a reject this story, believing in his absolute innocence from birth.
 
Telling the famous Story of the Blanket in which the Prophet covers
himself with a Yemeni blanket for his afternoon rest. Joined under
the blanket first by his son-in-law Ali, then each of his grandchildren
Hassan and Hussain and finally by his daughter Bibi Fatima.
 
In Heaven Gabriel asks God about the five under the blanket and
God says, those are the five people whom I loved the most out of all
creation, and I made everything in the heavens and the earth for
their sake.
 
Gabriel, speaker on God’s behalf, whisperer to Prophets, asks God, can
I go down and be the sixth among them.
 
And God says, go down there and ask them. If they consent you may go
under the blanket and be the sixth among them.
 
Creation for the sake of Gabriel is retroactively granted when the group
under the blanket admits him to their company.
 
Is that me at the edge of the blanket asking to be allowed inside.
 
Asking the 800 hadith be canceled, all history re-ordered.
 
In Hyderabad I prayed every part of the day, climbed a thousand steps
to the site of Maula Ali’s pilgrimage.
 
I wanted to be those stairs, the hunger I felt, the river inside.
 
I learned to pronounce my daily prayers from transliterated English
in a book called “Know Your Islam,” dark blue with gold calligraphed
writing that made the English appear as if it were Arabic complete with
marks above and below the letters.
 
I didn’t learn the Arabic script until years later and never learned the
language itself.
 
God’s true language: Hebrew. Latin. Arabic. Sanskrit.
 
As if utterance fit into the requirements of the human mouth.
 
I learned how to find the new moon by looking for the circular absence

When Abraham took Isaac up into the thicket his son did not know
where he was being led.
 
When his father bound him and took up the knife he was shocked.
 
And said, “Father, where is the ram?”
 
Though from Abraham’s perspective he was asked by God to sacrifice
his son and proved his love by taking up the knife.
 
Thinking to himself perhaps, Oh Ismail, Ismail, do I cut or do I burn.
 
I learned God’s true language is only silence and breath.
 
Fourth son of a fourth son, my father was afflicted as a child and
as was the custom in those days a new name was selected for him to
protect his health.
 
Still the feeling of his rough hand, gently cupping my cheek, dipping the
steel comb in water to comb my hair flat.
 
My hair was kept so short, combed flat when wet. I never knew my hair
was wavy until I was nearly twenty-two and never went outside with wet
and uncombed hair until I was twenty-eight.
 
At which point I realized my hair was curly.
 
My father’s hands have fortune-lines in them cut deeply and dramatic.
 
The day I left his house for the last time I asked him if I could hold his
hand before I left.
 
There are two different ways of going about this.
 
If you have known this for years why didn’t you ask for help, he
asked me.
 
Each time I left home, including the last time, my mother would hold a
Quran up for me to walk under. Once under, one would turn and kiss
the book.
 
There is no place in the Quran which requires acts of homosexuality to
be punishable by lashings and death.
 
 Hadith or scripture. Scripture or rupture.
 
Should I travel out from under the blanket.
 
Comfort from a verse which also recurs: “Surely there are signs in this
for those of you who would reflect.”
 
Or the one hundred and four books of God. Of which only four are
known—Qur’an, Injeel, Tavrat, Zubuur.
 
There are a hundred others—Bhagavad-Gita, Lotus Sutra, Song of
 Myself, the Gospel of Magdalene, Popul Vuh, the book of Black Buffalo
 Woman—somewhere unrevealed as such.
 
Dear mother in the sky you could unbuckle the book and erase all the
annotations.
 
What I always remember about my childhood is my mother whispering
to me, telling me secrets, ideas, suggestions.
 
She named me when I moved in her while she was reading a calligraphy
of the Imam’s names. My name: translated my whole life for me as
 Patience.
 
In India we climbed the steps of the Maula Ali mountain to the top,
thirsting for what.
 
My mother had stayed behind in the house, unable to go on pilgrimage.
She had told me the reason why.
 
Being in a state considered unacceptable for prayers or pilgrimages.
 
I asked if she would want more children and she told me the name she
would give a new son.
 
I always attribute the fact that they did not, though my eldest sister’s first
son was given the same name she whispered to me that afternoon, to my
telling of her secret to my sisters when we were climbing the stairs.
 
It is the one betrayal of her—perhaps meaningless—that I have never
forgiven myself.
 
There are secrets it is still hard to tell, betrayals hard to make.
 
You hope like anything that though others consider you unclean God
will still welcome you.
 
My name is Kazim. Which means patience. I know how to wait."

1923,Lucifer,Dean Young,"You can read almost anything
about angels, how they bite off

a mute in his trumpet to torture them back.
The pornographic magazines ported
into the redwoods. The sweetened breath
of the starving. The prize livestock
rolls over on her larval young,
the wooden dwarf turning in the cogs
of the clockworks. I would have
a black bra hanging from the shower rod.
I would have you up against
the refrigerator with its magnets
for insurance agents and oyster bars.
Miracles, ripped thumbnails,
everything a piece of something else,
archangelic, shadow-clawed,
the frolicking despair of repeating
decimals because it never comes out even.
Mostly the world is lava’s rhythm,
the impurities of darkness
sometimes called stars. Mostly
the world is assignations, divorces
conducted between rooftops. Forever
and forever the checkbook unbalanced,
the beautiful bodies bent back
like paper clips, the discharged
blandishing cardboard signs by the exits.
Coppers and silvers and radiant traces,
gold flecks from our last brush,
brushfires. Always they’re espousing
accuracy when it’s accident, the arrow
not in the aimed-for heart but throat
that has the say. There are no transitions,
only falls."

The August rain

of all aspect
at a distance:
 
yet our sudden
wet bodies, firm
 
swelling divested
finally of shirts
 
& trousers, left
beside turbid
 
footprints on
the tiled floor;
 
this tongue, these
lips the lightning
 
over the unchartered
landscape of your
 
thigh: successive
terra nova to
 
resist the still
life of the body"
1926,Anatomy Class,Betsy Franco,"The chair has
arms.
The clock,
a face.
The kites have
long and twirly tails.
The tacks have
heads.
The books have
spines.
The toolbox has
a set of nails.
Our shoes have
tongues,
the marbles,
eyes.
The wooden desk has
legs and seat.
The cups have

What a surprise!

 Is our classroom alive?"
1927,Are We There Yet?,David L. Harrison,"My foot’s

You say
“an hour”

Your

1928,Autumn's Way,Charles Ghigna,"In their yellow-most goings,
leaves of maple

You can hear their sound

the golden sidewalks

1929,Before,Avis Harley,"The butterfly was there
before any human art was made.
Before cathedrals rose in prayer,
the butterfly was there.
Before pyramids pierced the air
or Great Wall stones were laid,

Before any human, art was made."
1930,Blueprints?,Sara Holbrook,"Will my ears grow long as Grandpa's?
What makes us look like kin?
Tell me where'd I get long eyelashes
and where'd I get my chin?
 
Where'd I get my ice cream sweet tooth
and this nose that wiggles when I talk?
Where's I get my dizzy daydreams
and my foot-rolling, side-step walk?

Did I inherit my sense of humor
and these crooked, ugly toes?
What if I balloon like Uncle Harry
and have to shave my nose?
 
How long after I start growing
until I start to shrink?
Am I going to lose my teeth,
some day?
My hair?
My mind?
 
Do you think
I'll be tall or short or thin
or bursting at the seams?
Am I naturally this crazy?
Is it something in my genes?
 
I'm more than
who I am,
I'm also
who I'm from.
It's a scary speculation--   
Who will I become?"
1931,Defrosting the Freezer,Ralph Fletcher,"One container of spaghetti sauce
Grandma made before she died.

Two old pieces of wedding cake
you couldn’t pay me to eat.

Three snowballs from last winter
slightly deformed, no longer fluffy.

Four small flounder from the time
Grandpa took me deep-sea fishing.

Everything coated with a thick
white layer of sadness."

He’s got feathers!
He’s got guts!

Oh, the rooster

What’s he thinking?

No one knows."
1933,Sophie,Steven Herrick,"It’s like I thought it would be.
Absolute silence.
Just me and my poem.
But,
as I stand onstage
preparing to start,
I realize the audience is quiet
because they want to hear me.
Silence isn’t scary.
It’s like Mr. Carey said,
silence is my chance.
And so I speak,
slowly
and clearly,
and I don’t see
the faces in front of me.
I see the images of my poem,
and I think only of what I’m saying
and how much it means to me.
My voice grows stronger
and I don’t have to struggle
to remember the words.
 
I know them
because I wrote them."

1936,Cue Lazarus,Carl Marcum,"Start this with the invocation:
             a seventy-seven Pinto,
             an eastbound freeway, two boys
a few months from their driver’s license.

It happens again because you’ve
             said it. You sit in the back seat,
             a ghost of red vinyl, to listen
to these boys—one of whom was you,

the one along for the ride—talk
              brave about cheerleaders
              and socket wrenches as they pass
a stolen cigarette between them.

They don’t know you’re there,
              wouldn’t believe in you should
              they look backstage, backseat.
The boys are driving back from an October

orchard where they’d gone to see leaves
              change. You remember: orange, brown,
              as though you’d just seen those leaves,
because in this proximity

to yourself—the boy in the passenger
               seat—you are thinking the
               same thing, and each of your in-
carnations feels like they’ve thought this

before. Your ghost, your present tense
               thinks that maybe this isn’t right.
               Now you’re along for the ride.
These boys haven’t cuffed up against

their own mortality yet, though one
               of them is sick. The other one,
               driving and picking at the thin
hair falling from his scalp, will die

soon, because what lurks in his dark
               blood can be cured by medical
               science. And that cure is what will
kill him, as it leaves him weak,

unable to fight off infection
               in his lungs. But that comes later.
               You are here with them now to find
out what you owe to whom—your life,

mortgaged to one of these boys
               and you’ve never been able to
               rectify that debt. You are the
stage direction, a ghost backstage,

wanting a spotlight, a soapbox
               a soliloquy. Dissolve
               back into your life, like sugar
in tea—exit this scene now, stage left.

                               *

You are the apparition again
               in your mother’s house. You follow
               yourself down the yellow hallway
to the ringing phone in the kitchen.

You already know who’s calling,
               the way you knew then—when you were
               the self you’re haunting. Your friend
is dead. You know this even before

his sister tells you—but because your
               ghost is too close, the boy can feel
               your grief, but can’t feel his own.
And you did know then, didn’t you?

You knew that morning, that the earth
               awakes closest to the sun—four
               days into every new year.
And Lazarus, dead now, four days.

Roll away the stone. Believe
               in something besides the past.
               Awaken from this dream like
a man called out from a cave.

It happens this way each time:
               a bourbon breakdown in January
               rain—weeping an invocation,
cursing corollary.

                               *

Can you go to Tom’s grave today
               and mandate him back to this life?
               Should you cue him from the wing
like a stage direction? Would he

damn you—a sadness, a gravestone
               on your chest, for calling him
               into this mortal suffering?
If you had been in Houston that day

he’d have died anyway. You’re a fool
               to think you can bargain across the river.
               Haunting the past won’t stop
it from happening each time, exactly

the same way. Won’t stop your heart
               from breaking like a glass decanter,
               brown whisky sliding
mercury across the tile."

1938,Lost in Translation,Gabriel Gomez,"The kinship with those humans
who speak directly to me
is webbed to the ceiling.
An economy of satellites, a cosmos,
where revision we think
comes without the benefit
of our witness. A peculiar time
when stars with modest faces
sleep in enormity and mirror
death like a child’s infirmity that
despite socio-economics
is still an illness,
definitive as fading paint
grossing a distant
understanding from a stain
pooled from its center
resonant of some terrific
nucleus making sense
of its own words
with the strangest electricity."
1939,On Pattern,Pimone Triplett,"For Grandfather, in Bangkok

I can tell you, sweeping the several jigsaw lizards
         away from your casket, away from their expert
                   invasions, kneeling by the order of our births
alongside the mother-of-pearl mosaics,
         the family at your death keeps to form,
                  having to act out that love of endings.
 
I can say the little I know of how you lived
         is your patient gaze in old photographs,
                   surrounded by three generations, most of the spindling
offspring back from the States or Australia or wherever
          they’d been taken, children barely known but abided
                   on holidays. Today I’m told we have to place
 
pennies in the dead man’s mouth
         to remind us of the portions
                  left behind.
 You pay the debt,
           someone says, you give your something solid back,
                      push your currency up against the open,

 up against the father tongue. It’s the formal
            silence we love, the hush that’s planned,
                      the good answer,
monks, boyish and newly shorn, who know
         to whip your burial cloth exactly three times
                   over the altar flame to purify countless threads.
 
Who know when to kneel, when to back away
         from the casket. The casket itself carved
                   patiently, inlaid with the images,
portions left behind of silver
          shrunken disciples, each framed to each then
                             framed again by
 
squares of alabaster scrollwork
                   whittled into black wood:
                             the whole teak surface worried,
Grandfather, with carpenter’s gold,
                  splintered,
                           then resplintered, puzzled with lapis.
 
The eastern window’s been slivered open,
         to make the sun stab
                  the craftmen’s metallic fretwork.
The mourners too,
           suddenly embossed, become dozens shifting
                    to kneel. When a few clouds
 
eclipse the sun, wiping away the borders,
           the frame and scrimshaw,
                    so that we stand
briefly
         in the room’s darkened largeness,
                   next to me someone whispers,
 
how your vessel is rented,
         a work
             to be given back."
1940,Snapshots with Wide Apertures Shown on the Road,Pimone Triplett,"1
 
This one’s on Route 80 south of Water’s End, Arizona, speeding
anywhere else when I’m tired
of reading the yellow dash-and-dash, highway’s old adage.
Sunglasses coaxed
yellows to reds, though there are none where I look
into the camera.
Behind me, a blur of roadside cactus called
“succulents,”
for the moisture they save for years.
The sky cut from indigo to blue to white until
I wished for the sunset’s truncations to stay there,
thinking, too, that the verge of its curve
could flirt me into
the absolute.

Moving on, in Bangkok, I’m always crouching in these,
wanting to keep my head
lower than his
to show I know
he’s Mother’s father.
 
Asked, on going in, not to say anything
if he brought up the distant
old dealings, metallic shrillings
of long-dead women,
asked to ignore what they’d do for him,
offerings he could almost eat a meal on.
 
And this from the aunt who was asked to leave
the family when she was young,
“for the sake of the children,”
drawing the bad lot.
No one told me why.
 
That’s my foot in the foreground.
That was the daylight’s assignment
of unwavering white, the background.
 
These are only the circumstances. As for an end to the glare
getting the last word in,
there was none.

He’d set the machine on the tripod himself,
return to read the newspaper, wait for the click,
and want to keep it,
the stop-time, that is,
the pretending to read the newspaper.
Held half in the shadow fans of the palm tree,
half in a browbeat of sun.
So that the machine had to catch him quickly, the clarity,
the shot of his legs as
 
suddenly: brown leather sheaves holding bone.

Say the moment arrives
at the frame, and she who is about to enter
the picture approaches.
At the end of the road trip, she turns back
in the hopes of memorizing what’s been passed,
the colors that changed, the mirror-winks,
the real moisture, invisible, along side mirage.
 
His face was a once-darker shade of dust in his country.
Some days he’d set the aperture, the opening,
as wide as he could,
to ruin the picture, to let all the light in."
1941,Timbre,Gabriel Gomez,"I can’t tell you I had climbed for hours on
ledges and crawled through gaps in the earth.
 
My hands negotiating
through the teeth of the palisade
lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies.
 
And I can’t tell you that I came
onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof,
ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water.
 
Feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight
a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood.
 
The opposite end of root
speaking for its entirety through
silence and color.
 
And I wish I could tell you that at the moment
I met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone
your name appeared in my throat with clarity.
 
And I wish we were old
and in front of a grand painting,
a picture or postcard of
Picasso’s “Guernica” perhaps.
It would be then that I would tell you
Picasso once said that it took him his entire life
to learn how to paint like a child.
 
It would be through these words
that would make you understand
the same clarity that pooled over me
on that ledge those years before
when as a young man I extended
like direction, like timbre itself
for a dying song that echoed your name."
1942,When Roots Are Exposed,Esther Belin,"I.
The empty of stomach
manifests silence
a stillness
that levels
coffee in a cup
and in a respectful manner
allows steam to penetrate
the surface.
Reversal of action
has created my sandstone canyon
rooted cedar and sage at my feet.
This movement is where
a tranquility stems.

II.
When my child creates
bubbles through a soapy wand,
I occupy the action of fate
that bursts the perfect form.
A halcyon absorbed
nesting within
the existence of the form
that no longer exists.
The formless form
is where my mind floats.

III.
It is easy to give form
especially with English words
a promotion of mechanical ligaments
binding spirit with assembly-fabricated molds.
Just as my hair poses an appendage of my brain
my tongue poses an appendage of my heart.
I cannot classify this thought as a typewritten symbol.
An ideogram of essence
cultivates my stillness to action."
1943,Back from the Fields,Peter Everwine,"Until nightfall my son ran in the fields,
looking for God knows what.
Flowers, perhaps. Odd birds on the wing.
Something to fill an empty spot.
Maybe a luminous angel
or a country girl with a secret dark.
He came back empty-handed,
or so I thought.

Now I find them:
thistles, goatheads,
the barbed weeds
all those with hooks or horns
the snaggle-toothed, the grinning ones
those wearing lantern jaws,
old ones in beards, leapers
in silk leggings, the multiple
pocked moons and spiny satellites, all those
with juices and saps
like the fingers of thieves
nation after nation of grasses
that dig in, that burrow, that hug winds
and grab handholds
in whatever lean place.

It’s been a good day."
1944,The Word That Is a Prayer,Ellery Akers,"One thing you know when you say it:
all over the earth people are saying it with you;
a child blurting it out as the seizures take her,
a woman reciting it on a cot in a hospital.
What if you take a cab through the Tenderloin:
at a street light, a man in a wool cap,
yarn unraveling across his face, knocks at the window;
he says, Please.
By the time you hear what he’s saying,
the light changes, the cab pulls away,
and you don’t go back, though you know
someone just prayed to you the way you pray.
 Please: a word so short
it could get lost in the air
as it floats up to God like the feather it is,
knocking and knocking, and finally
falling back to earth as rain,
as pellets of ice, soaking a black branch,
collecting in drains, leaching into the ground,
and you walk in that weather every day."
1945,And the Ship Sails On,Joel Brouwer,"He faced the sink, one foot up
on the edge of the tub. She stood
behind him, reaching around.
In the mirror, her face rose
over his shoulder like the moon,
and like the moon she regarded him
beautifully but without feeling,
and he looked at her as he would
at the moon: How beautiful!
 How distant! No smiling, no weeping,
no talking. A man and a woman
transacting their magnificent business
with the usual equanimity. The man
as a passenger walking the ship’s deck
at evening and the woman as the moon
over his shoulder oiling the ocean
with light. Deep in the ship’s belly
pistons churned and sailors fed
the boilers' roar with coal. On deck
just the engine’s dull thrum and
a faint click as the woman sets her ring
on the cool white lip of the sink."
1946,The Exact Change,Joel Brouwer,"He slaughtered a six of Miller in thanks
when his supposed schizophrenia turned
out to be mere panic, fewer than half
the syllables and “easily managed with
the new medications.” Chanted that mantra
when his piano teacher’s voice droned on
like an undertow beneath Chopin hours
after she herself had gone home to Queens
and when stop signs seemed to say slightly more
than stop, seemed in fact to convey highly
specific messages to him and him alone
suggesting he assume certain key
responsibilities including twenty-four-hour
telephone contact with his finacée
“to make sure nothing bad happens to her”
and the immediate emergency
closure of the Holland Tunnel…Oh, come
on, Doc! If this isn’t schizo what is?
And after all it took so long to nose
the rental car’s savage servility
through New Jersey for Thanksgiving at her
mother’s that by the time he arrived he
can’t possibly have been the same person
he had been when he left Brooklyn and is
that not a kind of multiple person-
ality? It took hours. And then it was
awkward. Which could describe so many things.
The gangly half-dismantled turkey splayed
on its platter. Her stepfather's lecture
on property taxes and tougher sentences.
The seven-dollar jug of Chablis which
would come up later while he held back her hair.
Every good boy deserves fudge and he tried
to be one and earn huge loamy slabs of it.
He practiced his scales on the steering wheel
as he breezed by stop sign after stop sign
toward the tunnel, stopped to search for the
exact change, then resumed rehearsal as
she, deeply soused, snored wetly beside him
smelling like something spilled on a rug. He
keyed each étude over and over as though
there would not be many more chances or
changes which I typed first by accident
but had the chance to change for which I am
thankful. But what am I doing in here."
1947,Focus,Joel Brouwer,"Photograph found in the road: bejeweled hand
gripping a limp dick. All parties
suffering from lack of ambition. The hills
of Tuscany won’t dapple with sunlight,
and here it is nearly noon. She didn’t
much want the leather jacket, the vendor didn’t
really care to sell it, she hardly tried
it on, he barely praised her beauty, then
everyone wasn’t hungry and went to lunch.
The rubies won’t glow. The delayed train shrugs
on its siding. The penis appears at ease.
 Osteria, osteria, osteria, osteria.
I knew many words but preferred to say
the same ones over and over, like
a photographer shooting four frames
of the same subject, hoping for one in focus.
This clearly among the other three."
1948,Punk Half Panther,Juan Felipe Herrera,"Lissen
to the whistle of night bats—
 oye como va,
in the engines, in the Chevys
& armed Impalas, the Toyota gangsta’
monsters, surf of new world colony definitions
& quasars & culture prostars going blam

    over the Mpire, the once-Mpire, carcass
neural desies for the Nothing. i amble
outside the Goddess mountain. Cut across
the San Joaquín Valley, Santiago de Cuba,
Thailand & Yevtushenko’s stations;
hunched humans snap off cotton heads
gone awry & twist
nuclear vine legs.

Jut out to sea, once again—this slip
sidewalk of impossible migrations. Poesy mad
& Chicano-style undone wild.

Rumble boy. Rumble girl.
In wonder & amazement. On the loose.
Cruisin’ shark-colored maze of presidential bombast, death
enshrined archipelago fashion malls, neutered wars
across the globe come barreling down
on my Neo-American uzi mutations, my uppgraded
2Pac thresholds. My indigo streets, i say

with disgust & erotic spit, Amerikaner frontier consciousness
gone up long ago. Meet my barriohood, meet me
with the froth i pick up everyday & everyday
i wipe away with ablution & apologia & a smirk, then
a smile on my Cholo-Millennium liberation jacket.

No motha’, no fatha’,
no sista’, no brotha’.
Just us in the genetic ticktock
culture chain, this adinfinitum, clueless Americana
grid of inverted serapes, hallucinations of a nation,
streets in racist Terminator
coagulation.

Get loose
after the day-glo artery of a fix.
Power outages propel us into cosmos definition,
another forty-million-New-Dollar-Plantation Basilica,
or is it tender chaos?

My upside-down
Kahlúa gallon oración drool
blackish metal flake desires, the ooze of Dulcinea—
Tepeyac stripper, honey
from Tara’s open green fans. Tara?

Tara, where are you?
Tara of the blessings & weapons against illusion.
Against administrator pig,
against molester snake,
against rooster corporate lust. Remember me?
i am the black-red blood spark worker,
Juana Buffalo’s illegitimate flight usher,
back up from Inframundo.

Quick ooze again,
this formless city space
i live in—
my circular false malaria.

Fungi Town says everything’s awright
without your Holy Wheel,
your flaming tree wombs, this sista’ bundle
i ache for, the one i lost

in a fast brawl for redemption
at the gates of this Creation Mulatto Hotel,
this body passage, this wonder
    fire from the chest.

i stand alone on Mass Man Boulevard.
Look east, look south. Bleary sirens
come howling with vats of genocide &
grey prison gang buses jam
with my true brotha’ wetbacks.

Pick another bale of tropical grape,
another bushel of pesticide & plutonium artichoke.
Cancer tomatoes the biggest in the world.
Bastard word, bracero produce, alien culture—

           power & slime.
Crawl up my back, heavy
loaded on cheap narratives,
Salinas doubles, Atlantis sketched on Gorbachev’s forehead:
you, yes, you, gator-mouthed agent—like gila progeny.
Let’s hustle. Let’s trade.
It is 1:27 A.M. in da rat Arctic.
What do i trade passion for?

Language escapes me. Passion is smoke.
i dissolve.

It is in my nature to disappear. No sista’, no brotha’.
No motha’, no soul. This shred iciness is all,
a crazy register that destroys itself into Polaroid,
into a glacial sheet of multicolored border walls.

Let’s foam & spin flamey
bluish tears for the Thing-Against-Itself, soul-less soul,
this film word surface. Sing out, baby.
Wobble & bop to town.

Drag yo’ hands
across my fine-tuned work train named Desastre
en route to Freetown—engineered African shaman houses
smell of licorice, Ebola & famine blood, of hair torn,
of death owls & cancerous alcoholic livers, of babies sucking
this deep night to come,

then—a busted chink of afternoon copper light wakes us,
yo’ sista’ rolls in with a bag of lemons for Evil Eye,
for the seven-inch ache in her abdomen.
Keep me in stride. You.

i am talking to you, fool. Don’t
just sit there stretchin’ yo’ face.

Tell me why fire yearns for the heart.
Write it down. Say it. Fool. Speak the names.

Conjure the recitations from the coffee cup,
the steel-toe, border-crosser boots.

The grass rips up the morning snow lights, jagged & yellowish.
My AIDS face is hidden. Your rot, my epistemology.

i stand in pure light, a blaze of eyes & arms,
volcanic & solar, autistic, anti-written,
burned by mad friars & clerics, uptown
octopi readers, my long hair falls as reddish honey,
on a naked supple back,
   on breasts small & secretive.

Mystery evades me. Shadows crumble.
Without attention i locate the love void & yet,
i know all is well. My blood rocks to a bolero
out of rhythm, a firefly’s bolero that is,
the one in the dog eye. Hear me
warm up to the multi-night. Scribble poems &
    shout rebuke for the sake of scarred angels,
for Tara, who guides me
in her emeraldine, sequined night of lies.
Hear me now,

kin to the half-collie language that i keep & walk.
Kin now, to the leaves that plunge to the floors;
swivel whiteness without axis, tectonic blasts
without mercy. Straitjackets float on the river infinity.

Pink-skinned fishes stare back
as they evolve into my shape, my babble stream
magnetic juan-foolery. Arm wrestle me
on the soccer lawn, kick me in the balls.
The murder music is for everyone.

   The Last Mayan Acid rock band
   plays Berlin’s latest score:

dead trade market systems for the dead proletariats,
rip up from Bangkok to Tenejapa. Everyone is
meaningful & vomits, everyone deposits
a stench pail, into the Cube—

Neo-America,
without the fissure of intimate thighs. Cross over into fire,
hunger & spirit. i write on my hand:
the road cuts into a star. Go, now, go, fool.
In your lyric wetback saxophone, the one yo’ mama left you,
the Thing-Against-Itself strapped across your hips.

Do not expect me
to name—this Thing-Against-Itself. Play it. Screw it.
Howl up to the Void, the great emptiness,
the original form.

 Night Journal:
Keep on rockin’, blues fish, the gauze of hte day into night. Out there
somewhere, Dis-America, pick up a chrome bone, the shards of the last
   Xmas
Presidential extravaganza. You, of course, fool.
  

Swivel into the clear. Float over the greenish migrant barracks pocked with wire
torsos, toes wiggle & predict our forthcoming delirium—there is a velvet panther
shouting out OM in funk, there is a tawny word in the middle of the city
thoroughfare, a planetary semi of lives slices the wet animal in half. i am that
punk half panther. My fierce skull & mandible, formidable, my pelt is exact as
witch quartz, a slashed leg tumbles down the highway, battered by every dirty,
steel wheel. Face up to the sky, you, i said, to the brilliant gossip from the
Goddess parade. Outside, outside.
 
 
So.
Crawl up, baby, come on, keep on floatin’—
sliding’, always: for black journeys, always in holiness.

                            From Border-Crosser With a Lamborghini Dream, 1999."
1949,Blues for Almost Forgotten Music,Roxane Beth Johnson,"I am trying to remember the lyrics of old songs
                                                            I’ve forgotten, mostly
I am trying to remember one-hit wonders, hymns,
                                              and musicals like West Side Story.
Singing over and over what I can recall, I hum remnants on
                                                             buses and in the car.
 
I am so often alone these days with echoes of these old songs
                                                          and my ghosted lovers.
I am so often alone that I can almost hear it, can almost feel
                                                        the half-touch of others,
can almost taste the licked clean spine of the melody I’ve lost.
 
I remember the records rubbed with static and the needle
                                                                     gathering dust.
I remember the taste of a mouth so sudden and still cold from
                                                                         wintry gusts.
It seemed incredible then — a favorite song, a love found.
                                                                It wasn't, after all.
 
Days later, while vacuuming, the lyrics come without thinking.
Days later, I think I see my old lover in a café but don’t,
                                                                        how pleasing
it was to think it was him, to finally sing that song.
 
This is the way of all amplitude: we need the brightness
                                                                         to die some.
This is the way of love and music: it plays like a god and
                                                                       then is done.
Do I feel better remembering, knowing for certain
                                                                       what’s gone?"
1950,Book Nine,Kathleen Graber,"One man prays: How shall I be able to lie with this woman?
      Do thou pray thus: How shall I not desire to lie with her?
      Another prays thus: How shall I be released from this?     
      Another prays: How shall I not desire to be released?
      —Marcus Aurelius

When we are lost in our longings, Aurelius, already it is too late:
there is already nothing we can do. I have rarely desired an end
to my desires. We are so in love with our wanting. Last week,
though doctors were quick to repair it, a baby in India was born
grasping her own beating heart in her fist. Today, a Dumpster
arrives from Dave’s Trash Removal & I begin to fill it. I toss in
a transistor radio that hasn’t worked in years. A man walking past
asks if he can take it. Later, he returns & carries off a broken TV.
A neighbor salvages the dented gray fuse box; a girl wants a window,
a paper bag full of tangled cords. All night I listen to the wind
& the echoes of feet kicking through rubbish, like a mouse nesting
inside a drum. My older brother is dead a decade. Yet here
in its enormous gold frame is the familiar, pastel portrait
someone named Maxwell drew for our mother, an inaccurate
rendering of the two of us when we were small. I can’t look at it;
I can’t throw it away. Every change is a death, you tell yourself,
 turn thy thoughts now to thy life as a child. . . . One day, I tell myself,
I will shut all the doors, leave everything behind. The museum
is showing a hundred tricked-out Victorian photographs
of that other world: the hoax of floating fairies, women haunted
by ghostly blurs. Another century & still we want to believe
in what we know cannot be true. Your words, Aurelius, have found me,
but you could not. If we are disappointed, we have only ourselves
to blame: Wipe out thy imagination. We fill our hands when they are
empty. We empty ourselves when we have held too much too long."
1951,Grand Slam,Marjorie Maddox,"Dreams brimming over,
childhood stretched out in legs,
this is the moment replayed on winter days
when frost covers the field,
when age steals away wishes.
Glorious sleep that seeps back there
to the glory of our baseball days."
1952,Night Dive,Peggy Shumaker,"Plankton rise toward the full moon 
spread thin on Wakaya’s surface. 
Manta rays’ great curls of jaw 
scoop backward somersaults of ocean 
in through painted caves of their mouths, out 
through sliced gills. Red sea fans
pulse. The leopard shark 
lounges on a smooth ramp of sand, 
skin jeweled with small hangers-on. 
Pyramid fish point the way to the surface.

Ninety feet down, blue ribbon eels cough, 
their mouths neon cautions. 
Ghost pipefish curl in the divemaster’s palm. 
Soft corals unfurl rainbow polyps, thousands 
of mouths held open to night.
Currents’ communion—giant clams 
slam shut wavy jaws, send 
shivers of water. Christmas tree worms 
snap back, flat spirals tight,
living petroglyphs against the night."
1953,Bearings,Megan Snyder-Camp,"The marriage ran under their skin, a rash, or maybe
all that red wine, luminescent cocktail hours
in which lost books were rediscovered, or just a rash,
a reaction sending out runners across her chest,
a vine, something close, ruby scarves coming back
into fashion, their son coming back
from school, from the yard, but now, dinnertime
and the family parted, split houses, her ex and his anger
spread down the long hallway of their house
and into the windows of her new apartment, their daughter’s doubled
beds, her doubled face in family portraits that double
in frequency, a family set down and another, this dinnertime
and more red wine, our faces flush with love and sympathy,
the mother decides to see the son again, and so
our doubled flashlights giving us heaven and earth,
all of it safe or at least unmoving, the tall fence
her ex built to hide the little grave, to guard the lot
in this registered historic district (all of the houses
bear their stories on a plaque, their first stories,
run-on, this little town with no street lights, just moon,
cedars), the tall fence behind which is the yard, blue,
in this yard no marker stone and under this stone
their son’s everything, no double,
no double"
1954,Dead Man,Kathleen Graber,"Some are born to sweet delight.                  
 Some are born to endless night.
 —William Blake, “Auguries of Innocence”

We spend our lives trying to grasp the premise. William Blake is not, for instance,
William Blake, but rather a 19th century accountant from Cleveland on the
lam for murder & the theft of a horse. In the closing scene,
 
he is going to die, & so is Nobody, his half-Blackfoot, half-Blood guide.
Sure, this is a Western, a morality tale
                                                                     about a destiny made manifest
through the voice of a gun & a hero whose mythic flight from innocence
 
destroys him. But we all come to the end of the line soon enough.
The obvious just seems wiser
                                                     when Nobody says it. Time, it turns out,
is the most common noun in the English language, as if by constant invocation,
 
we could keep it at bay.
                                             Yesterday, I sat in another state on a large rubber ball
in my brother’s basement bouncing my newborn nephew in my arms.
His mother, on the phone with a friend, asks what we should fear more,
 
the hobo spider or the poison that kills it. I want to whisper into his ear
something that feels like knowledge:
                                                                    Once upon a time, there was nothing
 & one day, there will be nothing again. This is the faraway place
 
to which his tiny weight calls me. If he could understand the words. I think,
he would know what I mean, having only just sprung himself
                                                                                                               from that fine sea.
Sometimes we coo to soothe him: Don’t cry, Little Bird. I know, I know.
 
But only the roar of the vacuum finally calms him,
                                                                                           for nothing sounds as much
like the lost world of the womb as the motors of our machines.
The root of travel means torture, having passed from Medieval Latin
 
into Old French. As the action opens, Johnny Depp, shot in black & white,
is already rocking into night on a train. And soon, he will begin his dying.
This is not to say that the inky band fanning across the morning blue
 
of a kestrel’s tail feathers
                                             has no meaning, or the first fingers of rust
coming into bloom on the green enameled chassis of a Corona typewriter
left in the rain.
                           Direct observation, the naturalist Niko Tinbergen assures us,
 
 is the only real thing. Perhaps this is what I should tell him.
                                                                                                             Or that this moment,
too, is a part of some migration. Every snow bunting composes its own song,
& a careful watcher can tell one kittiwake from its neighbor by the little dots
 
on the tips of its wings.
                                          The most used verb is also the most humble—
merely to be.
                        Nobody can teach to William Blake the auguries of William Blake.
We are, instead, our own vatic visions, bumbling prophets. Our sense of ourselves
as invented as film.
                                   Later, in an ocean-going canoe lined with cedar boughs,
he will drift out into cold breakers, two bullets in his chest. But, here,
in his small hat & wire glasses, he still seems
                                                                                 sweetly comic. He holds up a letter;
 
someone’s promised him a job. His fancy plaid suit makes him look like a clown."
1955,The Forest of Sure Things,Megan Snyder-Camp,"In this land the children tear their hearts in half.
Let me explain. If ten things are wanted, only ten
can be had. If a stand of birches is found to be made of tin,
the soil around them will bleed with rust. In this land children
study their magazines in broad daylight, and in their books
any soldier who stumbles will not fall. No one will fall,
a gift parents try not to make much of. At every meal
some is set aside. In every garden a patch lies fallow. At parties
there are whispers of illegal cheeses. Camembert, especially,
is said to taste alive. And so the children learn
to make room. To leave some.
Nothing will come, but nothing will go.
To love like this half must rattle in its pit."
1956,Mulatto,Roxane Beth Johnson,"Grandma is washing me white. I am the color of hot sand in the bleached sea light. I am a stain on the porcelain, persistent as tea. Stay in the shade. Don’t say she was the only one. Cousins opposite say: you too white. I am a night-blooming flower being pried open in the morning. My skin a curtain for a cage of bones, a blackbird coop. My heart is crusty bread, hardening. Hardening. This way, I feed my own fluttering. Under shade, the day looks like evening and I cannot bear the darkness. Don’t say, I can’t stand to be touched. Say, I stare into the sun to burn off the soiled hands that print my body with bloody ink. Don’t say, Mulatto. Say, I am the horse in Oz turning different colors, each prance brightening flesh. A curiosity. Don’t say, Bathwater spiraled down into the pipes. Say, I never did fade. Say, Skin holds the perseverance of my days. Folding, folding, the water continuously gathers, making wrinkles in a map."
1957,Pig-In-A-Blanket,Matthew Rohrer,"I wake up, bound tightly.
A warm, valerian smell cascades
to my palate. I can only move
my eyelids and toes.
Heat sits impishly on my chest,
at my throat, curtains of it brushing against me.
Panic creeps out of my armpits.
I can only move my eyelids and toes,
and this constant fluttering
lulls me to sleep.
 
I awake late and move like a bee
through the apartment,
from station to station
from the blue flame
to the shimmering disc.
From the stairs to the street,
to the grocery store.
To the meat aisle. To the cocktail wieners.
To make pigs-in-a-blanket,
to share them with friends.
To sink into bed, to bind myself
tightly in blankets, to flutter off into sleep,
and then on past sleep,
to be carried by admirers across a wooden bridge.
Later I will burn this bridge."
1958,Recording,Megan Snyder-Camp,"The first person in recorded history
struck by a comet slept on her couch
across the road from the Comet Drive-In
 
and the comet found her roof, her sadness, her knee,
and woke her. Everything that hurts
 
hurt before, she said. Showing at the drive-in, a documentary
on tightrope-walking: a young man frustrated
that his dream, the World Trade Center, was not yet built
 
so he practiced for years in a meadow crossing intended sky, intent
like a pillowcase sweetening him, no harm . . . Here
 
let the towers go, let them write his crossing, cursive, back and forth
 
his name steadying our tongues . . . Famous, overcoat
floating down without him, the idea that we stand
 
where we mean to stand, 1974, a distraction
 
from my parents’ morning commute. At 59th Street they split.
The poems I was writing were no longer poems of their divorce,
 
my father’s sweeping gestures or his pain, the old Volkswagen
and garden hose—all of that had washed from my poems
 
and instead an imaginary family arrived in borrowed gardens,
their son stillborn—even as I grew heavy with my own son
I wrote poem after poem holding this imagined horror close."
1959,Self-Portrait at Ten,Roxane Beth Johnson,"A boarded-up house. Ransacked inside — broken glass and toppled tables, chairs overturned, books shaken for hidden money.
 
There are mouths in dreams full of gold teeth, chewing bread and meat. The body is hollow as flame and will burn down anything if pointed straight.
 
A bird flies in through the door, then flutters at the window. Although he is tiny, I am too afraid to help him escape.

I’ve made myself another house. I hum to fill its empty rooms. I fold in like saloon doors closing, then swinging out, keeping out thieves."
1960,Wake,Megan Snyder-Camp,"The casseroles just showed up.
According to her sister a symbolic casting
 
of the feminine, not gender but physics, dear—
according to a friend she looked
 
just like her sister, green bathrobe mid-afternoon,
suitcase still in the trunk.
 
She’d carried him dead for days.
Out above the reeds a sphere of birds
 
stretches and knots, rises as one
brown then belly-white. Oh the hunger
 
when it came filled every chair."
1961,What I Do,Roxane Beth Johnson,"Eat cereal. Read the back of the box over and over. Put on my red velvet jumper with white heart shaped buttons. Walk to the bus, pick up discarded cigarette butts and pretend to smoke.
 
Get on the bus. Girls yell, Wire head, ugly black skin. Take a window seat, under the radio speaker. Look for cats hunting in the fields.
 
Go to class. Stay in at recess. Steal chewing gum, plastic green monkeys and cookies from desks. Eat in bathroom stalls. Pure white light pours in.
 
Try to get a bloody nose by punching myself in the same bathroom after lunch.
 
The teacher passes around pictures of herself pregnant. You were fat! I yell.  Everyone laughs. I lap it like licking honey from a spoon. I was pregnant, what’s your excuse? Everyone laughs. I swallow stones.
 
Grow tired in the afternoons, droop like a sunflower in the lengthening light.
 
Get on the bus. Girls yell, Brillo-head! Zebra! Sit in an aisle seat. Your father’s a nigger! I say, No, he’s a fireman. Laughter all around. Pinch myself shut like squeezing soap from a sponge.
 
Walk home. Sometimes find an unsmoked cigarette in the gravel along the curb—long, white, new. Put it to my lips, pull it away and hold it aloft, movie-star-like, all the way home."
1962,My Secret Flag,Rachel Loden,"What a giant I must seem to them, an exhausted giant who dozes above her sewing.

Asleep in mid-stitch, sorting the day’s haul of cinders, rubies, griefs—

They were laughing and carrying on, their tiny silver needles flying in and out, tiny silver thimbles on their fingers.

It’s no use of course, keeping secrets from them, when chattering is almost their religion.

Some held corners of the flag like an enormous quilt, and some danced on little shelves above the workshop.

They were so merrie that I fell asleep again.

In the morning my beautiful flag was finished, every stitch in place and every seam.

So now I raise it—slowly, underneath a secret sky.

Near the door to the half-daft and the cradle of kleptocracy.

Where it rips and shivers, rips and shivers once more

And makes me furiously glad, and fills me up with serious pleasure."
1963,Against Gregariousness,Clive James,"Facing the wind, the hovering stormy petrels
Tap-dance on the water.
They pluck the tuna hatchlings
As Pavlova, had she been in a tearing hurry,
Might once have picked up pearls
From a broken necklace.

Yellowfin drive the turbine of sardines
Up near the surface so the diving shearwaters
Can fly down through the bubbles and get at them.
Birds from above and big fish from below
Rip at the pack until it comes apart
Like Poland, with survivors in single figures.

The krill, as singletons almost not there
But en masse like a cloud of diamond dust
Against the sunlit flood of their ballroom ceiling,
Are scooped up by the basking shark’s dragline
Or sucked in through the whale’s drapes of baleen—
A galaxy absorbed into a boudoir
And nullified, a deep-space mass extinction
Watched only by the Hubble telescope.

Make your bones in a shark family if you can.
If not, be tricky to locate for sheer
Translucence, a slick blip that will become—
Beyond the daisycutter beaks and jaws—
A lobster fortified with jutting eaves
Of glazed tile, like the castle at Nagoya
Hoisted around by jacks and cranes, an awkward
Mouthful like a crushed car. That being done,
Crawl backwards down a hole and don’t come out."
1964,Beautiful Youth,Gottfried Benn,"The mouth of the girl who had lain long in the rushes
looked so nibbled.
When they opened her chest, her esophagus was so holey.
Finally in a bower under the diaphragm
they found a nest of young rats.
One little thing lay dead.
The others were living off kidneys and liver
drinking the cold blood and had
had themselves a beautiful youth.
And just as beautiful and quick was their death:
the lot of them were thrown into the water.
Ah, will you hearken at the little muzzles’ oinks!"
1965,"Brother, I’ve seen some",Kabir,"Brother, I’ve seen some
     Astonishing sights:
A lion keeping watch
     Over pasturing cows;
A mother delivered
     After her son was;
A guru prostrated
     Before his disciple;
Fish spawning
     On treetops;               
A cat carrying away
     A dog;
A gunny-sack
     Driving a bullock-cart;
A buffalo going out to graze,
     Sitting on a horse;
A tree with its branches in the earth,
     Its roots in the sky;
A tree with flowering roots.

This verse, says Kabir,
     Is your key to the universe.
If you can figure it out."
1966,Can Be No Sorrow,Gottfried Benn,"That narrow cot, hardly any bigger than a child’s, is where Droste died
(it’s there in her museum in Meersburg),
on that sofa Hölderlin in his tower room at the carpenter’s,
Rilke and George in hospital beds presumably, in Switzerland,
in Weimar, Nietzsche’s great black eyes
rested on white pillows
till they looked their last—
all of it junk now, or no longer extant,
unattributable, anonymous
in its insentient and continual disintegration.

We bear within us the seeds of all the gods,
the gene of death and the gene of love—
who separated them, the words and things,
who blended them, the torments and the place where they come to an end,
the few boards and the floods of tears,
home for a few wretched hours.

Can be no sorrow. Too distant, too remote,
bed and tears too impalpable,
no No, no Yes,
birth and bodily pain and faith
an undefinable surge, a lurch,
a power stirring in its sleep
moved bed and tears—
sleep well!"
1967,Chewing slowly,Kabir,"god my darling
do me a favour and kill my mother-in-law
             —Janabai, tr. Arun Kolatkar

Chewing slowly,
Only after I’d eaten
My grandmother,
Mother,
Son-in-law,
Two brothers-in-law,
And father-in-law
(His big family included)
In that order,
And had for dessert
The town’s inhabitants,

Did I find, says Kabir,
The beloved that I’ve become
One with."
1968,The Dry Bones,Paul Hoover,"My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself           —Ezekiel

And into the heavens, as on a bright day after rain,
there came the shapes of four creatures,
and they each had the likeness of a man,
and each man had four wings outstretched
and each wing had four eyes emblazoned, wide open,
given to weeping at the worlds they contained:

an eye-world of light, of fire and air,
of water and its mirror, heart and its first fear;
and in each world were four names,
entangled in its forest of letters,
whereupon I could read: Dow Jones, Cargill,
Chevron, and DeKalb of the frozen seed,
bearing but once and giving up its need; 

and under each name were discovered four meanings,
literal, figurative, rational, dim,
and under each meaning a counter-meaning, 
with its likeness of Freud, Marx, Hegel, and Lacan; 
and the four figures passed as one overhead,
their wingtips linked like molten silver joined.

For I, Ezekiel, had been given to eat
the very substance of God, 
and my eyes were open and my mouth spake,
as spring opens winter and winter closes fall;
and the earth turned rightly, to my senses sweet.
Son of man, they called me, a proverb and a sign.

Say: I am a sign of the city, the cauldron
where men burn down to desire. 
Say: I am the proverb of nothing and one,
boiling over the fire, rising out of belief
and falling, like a tyrant, out of derision alone.

And lo, a likeness, as of the appearance of fire,
the error of presence, of nothing as one,
and lo, another likeness, the appearance of water, 
the error of absence, of something as none;
for water surrounds all shapes that enter
but has no shape of its own, 
and fire is the shape of ruin alone.

For the princes of the sea 
shall cast their garments upon the land’s end:
their scholar’s robes, sharkskin suits, 
and alligator shoes, their Nikes,
Reeboks, and Chuvashian mittens
knitted by the children of shepherds, 
by tinsmiths and ladies’ men, 
in the dark at the back of the store; 
for the princes of fire consume what they love, 
with the reckless ambition of gods.

Yea, as I spake to dry bones that lay upon the earth,
they danced into being, and chattered, one and one,
down the hallways of my desert, the thresholds of my river.
For the Lord builds ruined palaces and plants desolation,
he receives what is absent; possesses all that is gone."
1969,The Ghost of Heaven,Carolyn Forché,"Sleep to sleep through thirty years of night,
a child herself with child, 
for whom we searched

through here, or there, amidst 
bones still sleeved and trousered,
a spine picked clean, a paint can, 
a skull with hair

Sewn into the hem of memory: 
Fire. 
God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob,
God not 
of philosophers or scholars. God not of poets. 

Night to night:
child walking toward me through burning maize
over the clean bones of those whose flesh
was lifted by zopilotes into heaven.

So that is how we ascend! 
In the clawed feet of fallen angels. 
To be assembled again 
in the work rooms of clouds.

She rose from where they found her lying
not far from a water urn, leaving 
herself behind on the ground
where they found her, holding her arms
before her as if she were asleep.

That is how she appears to me: a ghost in heaven.
Carrying her arms in her arms.

Blue smoke from corn cribs, flap of wings.
On the walls of the city streets a plague of initials.

Walking through a fire-lit river 
to a burning house: dead Singer
sewing machine and piece of dress. 

Outside a cashew tree wept 
blackened cashews over lamina. 

Outside paper fireflies rose to the stars.

Bring penicillin if you can, surgical tape, a whetstone, 
mosquito repellent but not the aerosol kind. 
Especially bring a syringe for sucking phlegm,
a knife, wooden sticks, a surgical clamp, and plastic bags.

You will need a bottle of cloud 
for anesthesia.

Like the flight of a crane 
through colorless dreams.

When a leech opens your flesh it leaves a small volcano.
Always pour turpentine over your hair before going to sleep.

Such experiences as these are forgotten 
before memory intrudes.

The girl was found (don’t say this)
with a man’s severed head stuffed 
into her where a child would have been.
No one knew who the man was. 
Another of the dead. 
So they had not, after all, 
killed a pregnant girl. 
This was a relief to them.

That sound in the brush? 
A settling of wind in sorghum.

If they capture you, talk.
Talk. Please yes. You heard me 
right the first time.

You will be asked who you are.
Eventually, we are all asked who we are.

All who come 
All who come into the world
All who come into the world are sent.
Open your curtain of spirit."
1970,His death in Benares,Kabir,"For Geoff Dyer

his front yard
is the true Benares
      — Devara Dasimayya,
          tr. A.K. Ramanujan

His death in Benares
Won’t save the assassin
From certain hell,

Any more than a dip
In the Ganges will send
Frogs—or you—to paradise.

My home, says Kabir,
Is where there’s no day, no night,
And no holy book in sight

To squat on our lives."
1971,"House of Cedar, Rafters of Fir",Paul Hoover,"Comfort me with apples; for I am sick of love          —Song of Solomon

scent of myrrh on the handles
            when oil is in the lock
silken is his mouth
            when he is hard upon me 

young heart, green bed,
            his fingers are in the stream
he eats of the bitter honey
            the sweetness of cherry

sacrament of the blood
            and of its winding
sacrament of arrival
            and of its binding

expert in earth, eager in flesh
            he falls upon me and feasts
the watchmen have not seen him
            nor the owl in her nest

his darkness at noon
            among the white buildings
a hand that was stone
            builds the inner temple

sacrament of what is written
            on the table of the heart
blueness of the wound
            where he has placed his kiss"
1972,How do you,Kabir,"How do you,
Asks the chief of police,
Patrol a city
Where the butcher shops
Are guarded by vultures;
Where bulls get pregnant,
Cows are barren,
And calves give milk
Three times a day;
Where mice are boatmen
And tomcats the boats
They row;
Where frogs keep snakes
As watchdogs,
And jackals
Go after lions?

Does anyone know
What I’m talking about?
Says Kabir."
1973,Hymn,Gottfried Benn,"That quality of the great boxers
to be able to stand there
and take shots,

gargle with firewater,
encounter intoxication
at sub- and supra-atomic levels,
to leave one’s sandals at the crater’s lip
like Empedocles, and descend,

not say: I’ll be back,
not think: fifty-fifty,
to vacate molehills
when dwarves want space to grow,
to dine alone,
indivisible,
and able to renounce your victory—

a hymn to that man."
1974,I won’t come,Kabir,"I won’t come
I won’t go
I won’t live
I won’t die

I’ll keep uttering
The name
And lose myself
In it

I’m bowl
And I’m platter
I’m man
And I’m woman

I’m grapefruit
And I’m sweet lime
I’m Hindu
And I’m Muslim

I’m fish
And I’m net
I’m fisherman
And I’m time

I’m nothing
Says Kabir
I’m not among the living
Or the dead"
1975,Last Spring,Gottfried Benn,"Fill yourself up with the forsythias
and when the lilacs flower, stir them in too
with your blood and happiness and wretchedness,
the dark ground that seems to come with you.

Sluggish days. All obstacles overcome.
And if you say: ending or beginning, who knows,
then maybe—just maybe—the hours will carry you
into June, when the roses blow."
1976,Little Aster,Gottfried Benn,"A drowned drayman was hoisted on to the slab.
Someone had jammed a lavender aster
between his teeth.
As I made the incision up from the chest
with a long knife
under the skin
to cut out tongue and gums,
I must have nudged it because it slipped
into the brain lying adjacent.
I packed it into the thoracic cavity
with the excelsior
when he was sewn up.
Drink your fill in your vase!
Rest easy,
little aster!"
1977,People Met,Gottfried Benn,"I have met people who,
asked after their names,
shyly—as if they had no title
to an appellation all to themselves—
replied “Fräulein Christian” and added:
“like the first name,” they wanted to make it easy for the other,
not a difficult name like “Popiol” or “Babendererde”—
“like the first name”—please, don’t burden your memory overmuch!

I have met people who
grew up in a single room with their parents
and four brothers and sisters, and studied at night
with their fingers in their ears at the kitchen table,
and grew up to be beautiful and self-possessed as duchesses—
and innerly gentle and hard-working as Nausicaa,
clear-browed as angels.

I have often asked myself and never found an answer
whence kindness and gentleness come,
I don’t know it to this day, and now must go myself."
1978,Plucking your eyebrows,Kabir,"Plucking your eyebrows,
Putting on mascara,
But will that help you
To see things anew?

The one who sees
Is changed into
The one who’s seen
Only if one is

Salt and the other
Water. But you, says Kabir,
Are a dead
Lump of quartz."
1979,A Shadow on the Wall,Gottfried Benn,"A shadow on the wall
boughs stirred by the noonday wind
that’s enough earth
and for the eye
enough celestial participation.

How much further do you want to go? Refuse
the bossy insistence
of new impressions—

lie there still,
behold your own fields,
your estate,
dwelling especially
on the poppies,
unforgettable
because they transported the summer—

where did it go?"
1980,"Shanidar, Now Iraq",Sarah Lindsay,"When bones and flesh have finished their business together,
we lay them carefully, in positions they’re willing to keep,
and cover them over.
Their eyes and ours won’t meet anymore. We hope.

It’s one of the oldest rules we mostly follow.
In the deep Stone Age in Shanidar, now Iraq,
someone or all of them laid or threw on the grandfather’s chest
whatever was blooming—
St. Barnaby’s thistle, yarrow, hollyhock...
His was their only burial before the frost.

For millennia, then, the dead might go under with thistle,
quantities of red ocher, a chunk of meat.
Now we have everlasting bouquets of plastic;
now we have hundreds a day to bag and box and pickle
to re-cross the Atlantic.

Light a row of oil wells and kneel
on sand too much embroiled for tombs.
Regrettably, something of the smell
is of bodies suddenly buried in fallen stones.
But some is incense, pinches of pulverized Baghdad rising
in ceremonial smoke:
dust of combatants, onlookers, miscellaneous limbs,
contents of hovels, contents of museums,
ancient pollen of yarrow and hollyhock."
1981,Think of the Unsatisfied Ones,Gottfried Benn,"When despair—
you who enjoyed great triumphs
and walked with confidence and the memory
of many gifts of delirium and dawns
and unexpected
turns—
when despair wants you in its grip,
and threatens you from some unfathomable depth
with destruction
and the guttering out of your flame:

then think of the unsatisfied ones,
with their migraine-prone temples and introverted dispositions,
loyal to a few memories
that held out little hope,
who still bought flowers,
and with a smile of not much luminosity
confided secret desires
to their small-scale heavens
that were soon to be extinguished."
1982,Threat,Gottfried Benn,"Know this:
I live beast days. I am a water hour.
At night my eyelids droop like forest and sky.
My love knows few words:
I like it in your blood."
1983,To tonsured monks and dreadlocked Rastas,Kabir,"To tonsured monks and dreadlocked Rastas,
To idol worshippers and idol smashers,
To fasting Jains and feasting Shaivites,
To Vedic pundits and Faber poets,
The weaver Kabir sends one message:
The noose of death hangs over all.
Only Rama’s name can save you.
Say it now."
1984,Torment,Daisy Fried,"“I fucked up bad”: Justin cracks his neck,
talking to nobody. Fifteen responsible children,
final semester college seniors, bloodshot,
collars undone, gorgeously exhausted, 
return from Wall Street interviews 
in attitudes of surrender on the Dinky—
the one-car commuter train connecting 
Princeton to the New York line. Panic-sweat 
sheens their faces. Justin hasn’t seen me yet. 
“Something’s fucked with my tie.” He’s right. 
I see his future, the weight he’ll gain 
first in his face, then gut and ass, the look 
of bad luck he’ll haunt his bad jobs with. 
He tears off the tie. Elephants on it. 

Fatigue, swollen ankles, the midwife said. 
The worst discomforts of pregnancy. 
I wrote those down. But she’s wrong: 
self-pity. Strange dreams, she said. 
No dreams. Discarded newspapers—
business section, money, real estate, auto—
sift apart to quartos and folios underfoot. 
“Shut up, Justin,” says the girl across from him. 
I hardly recognize Brianna in her interview hair. 
She scratches her face, fingers trembling 
from the day’s aftershocks. “I wanted,” 
she counts on her fingers, performing 
the sitcom of her tragedy, “Tribeca loft, 
expense account, designer clothes so haute 
they don’t look it, my very own Tesla, summer 
home in the Hamptons I’m too busy to use.”
“You wanted money,” says Justin.
Brianna: “It went down with the towers.”

I spent my lopsided day lifting my belly
back towards center, interviewing for adjunct jobs. 
There’s a half-moon in half-clouds 
up over the tracks. Justin spreads 
over three seats, texts with his thumbs, 
talks: “The Lehman Brothers guy asks me, 
Did you ever sell anything? Sell me a bottle of water. 
I’m like fu-uck. To say something I say 
‘Why do you like water?’ He says...” 
Justin fixes a diamond stud back in his ear. 
“They’ll let me know.” Fifteen responsible children
sigh in disappointed relief. Somebody they know
didn’t get the job they didn’t get. I sleep. Wake.
Beautiful clothes spread bodiless before me!
Tailored black suits and skirts, silk ties,
ephemera of sheer and filmy stockings 
deflated over seat backs. Brianna looks around,
no conductor coming, squats to peel off, 
in one motion, skirt, hose, underpants, step 
butt-naked into soft chino shorts I’ll never
be able to afford. “Nervous crotch sweat,” she says.

I keep trying to look not-quite-40
in a different way than I’m not-quite-40.
The woman interviewer looked at my belly.
“As a new mother would you have time to be 
literary mama to your students?” So I could sue
when they don’t hire me for the job I don’t want.
Justin looks up from his iPhone: “Soon-Ji
got three offers. Fuck.” He flips the curl
his mother’s fingers crimped, first day of pre-K
into his four-year-old forelock. “He’s guessing 
he’ll go with Goldman Sachs.” Brianna grabs her neck 
in living garrote. She high-fives anybody 
she can reach in gloomy delight. She gobbles
snack-pack popcorn, licks her fingers; bits drop
yellow from her lips. “My mom will go crazy
Deutsche Bank didn’t offer.” She sees me.
“I didn’t realize that was you with your hair up.
Look, Just.” She high-fives me. “It’s Professor.”

Is Brianna crying? “Don’t call me Professor,” 
I say, dozens of times a semester. “I’m a writer, 
not a teacher.” Justin grabs a Norton Anthology 
out of his five-hundred-dollar briefcase. “Fuck.
What are we supposed to read for tomorrow?”
“Prufrock, dummy,” Brianna says. “You’re 
a good professor.” She condescends through tears. 
“Poor baby,” mocks Justin, slumping so low 
in the seat I only see his shoe soles on the arm rest. 
The train swooshes through suburban tracts. 
The moon gets smaller. Brianna arrives 
mornings to workshop in a fake hurry 
and the sweats she slept in, probably rolls back
in bed after. She hands out slight, surprising poems,
apologizes, sips cardboard-container coffee 
in a recyclable sleeve, turns her BlackBerry to vibrate.
It moans like indigestion through class.

I hand her one of my self-pity tissues. My ankles 
are slim. Brianna hates her name. “So tacky.
I’d be a Kelly if I were twenty years older.”
I’d like to be able to hate her. I’m turning 
into my Favorite Teachers—so kind,
so industrious, so interested and interesting.
“Sorry I’m late with my portfolio,” she says
through sniffles. She dabs her lip. “I had to prepare for,”
a breath, “interviews.” A few times a semester
I say “It’s only poetry.” Gumbleeds! nosebleeds!
the midwife predicted, and it’s true, my Kleenexes
are measled with blood, weird hairs, stretch marks,
frequent catnaps, hip joints so loose you must 
take care walking. The fetus dabs its fingers 
in the sponge of me, flails. At the second class, 
Brianna said, “My mom would go crazy. 
I can’t read all these sex poems. We’re Christian.”
I said, “Poems should be about life,
part of life is sex.” Two kids wrote that down
in notebooks. One was Justin. “But skip
any reading that makes you uncomfortable.”
Next week, Brianna wrote about hanging 
onto stall walls in her residence hall bathroom,
fucking Princeton boys one by one.
Justin’s poem was “Torment,” seven pages long.

Favorite Teachers write poems about students!
Reading them is like listening to whores
talk about clients; however contemptuous they sound,
everybody knows who’s selling, who’s buying.
I’d like to be able to like them. I sleep. Wake. 
“Justin’s your boyfriend?” I whisper to Brianna.
My cell phone rings, screen says it’s my husband.
If I answer, I’ll cry. Voice mail takes it.
“God no,” says Brianna. “We hate each other,
right, Just? Never date the competition,
you destroy your luck. Besides.” She starts
morosely high-fiving again. “I’m a virgin.”
Justin laughs. She wraps her hair around her face
to smell it. “I pay attention in class.
Professor Krugman, he’s a real professor.”
She points at a headline I just kicked. Housing
Upturn Predicted. “He says housing increases
don’t matter in the long run. It’s a blip,
if it’s even a blip. If I don’t get a job, 
it’s Wharton mba. Or teach English in Japan.
But this girl on my floor told me Asian girls
depilate their whole bodies, even their arms.
I can’t be the hairiest person in my life.”

What will I do next year without the job
I don’t want? I sleep. “Hey!” says Brianna.
“I could go back to Spain, smoke Ducados
in okupa cafes. Be a poet! 
Sorry.” Laughs herself out of last tears
at the idea. “I didn’t mean to get all
Sylvia Plathy on you. Anyway, my trust fund
is safe. Knock plastic.” She reaches to rap the tie
Justin hung over the seat. I say, “In Madrid
workers smoke Ducados. Reds are for anarchista
Eurotrash wannabes.” Brianna lips the cigarette
she’ll light on the platform. “I’ll have my portfolio
next week, promise.” All semester she’s revised
following precisely, appallingly, my suggestions.
She says “Think of me as raw talent wasted.”
I’m pissed I think of her at all. Justin again,
talking at no one: “Merrill Lynch says
what interests you in our company? I’m amped. 
I’m whipped. I’m like ‘Um, I heard you were hiring?’
Nah, I’m giving him eight good reasons.
He cuts me off...” The train slows, surceases
with a hiss. Fifteen responsible children
stand in the aisle. Jizz, jess, fuck, markered
on seats by younger, irresponsible children.

Off the train, Justin jumps into a low Mazda coupe,
yellow as Dick Tracy’s hat, parked unticketed
at an expired meter, open to the rain. I autodial: 
“I’m at the station. Don’t come, I need the walk.” 
Brianna: “Where’s Soon-Ji anyway? Flying his plane back?
God, what’ll we do if nobody wants us?”
Justin: “Soon-Ji will fucking keep us I guess. 
All we have is Dad’s money.”
Brianna: “Mine’s Mom’s. Half of it gone in the crash. 
But Soon-Ji is great-grandfathered in. He’ll be richer
than we’ll ever be if he never gets a job at all.”
Justin: “Professor, you hand back comments tomorrow,
right? They’re important to me.”
“Fuck you, suck-up,” Brianna says.

Sometimes I forget I’m pregnant till I walk.
Brianna vaults into the car, leans out: 
“Want a ride, Professor? Cigarette?” 
She puts one in my mouth, lights it
with a naked boy lighter that squirts fire
out his tiny penis. “Beer?” Tears a can
off a six-pack choke-ring, sticks it in a baggie
she pulls from Justin’s glove compartment,
pops the top, shoves it in my hand. “Now
you can’t walk home—pregnant, smoking,
carrying a beer? You’d be arrested. Anyway, 
Soon-Ji is having a party. Cristal! Rappers! 
He produces them and brings his stable 
down from Queens. You have to come! 
He was going to take your workshop, 
he admires you, but took playwriting instead.”
For final relaxation in prenatal yoga, we do
our Kegels squatting in a circle, shut-eyed—
“for perineal strengthening,” the teacher said.
Then we lie on our sides, breathe in, breathe out,
bellies like dropped anchors on the floor.
Our muscles tick, smoothing, loosening.
The teacher reads an affirming poem. I tense up. 

Brianna: “We always say Krugman’s one of the few
Professors we’d friend on Facebook.
But, Daisy, we’d friend you too.” Memory: 
Favorite Teachers at our college house parties, 
slow-dancing with us, doing lines 
in our bathrooms. When are they going to grow up, 
we said. I wave, walk, drop the cigarette
in the beer, the can in the trash can, relieved 
to be embarrassed, triumphant, sorry. Justin 
drives along beside me, Brianna rides shotgun
standing like a surfer on a breaking wave. 
Justin—“Fuck”—floors it, roars past me, away.
I don’t know how to end this poem. On “Torment” 
I wrote: “You may want to find a way to suggest
ironic distance between the poet and speaker.”
I couldn’t figure out what else,
to responsible children, there was to say."
1985,Tracing,Gottfried Benn,"i

O those years! The green light of morning
and the still unswept pavements of pleasure—
summer yelled from every surface of the city
and supped at a horn
refilled from above.

Silent hour. Watery colors
of a pale green eye’s diluted stream
pictures in that magic green, glass dances,
shepherds and streams, a dome, pigeons—
woven, dispatched, shining, faded—
mutable clouds of happiness!

So you faced the day: the font
without bubbles, dawdling
buildings and staircases; the houses
locked up, it was for you to create
the morning, early jasmine,
its yelps, its incipient aboriginal
stream—still without end—O those years!

Something unquenchable in the heart,
complement to heaven and earth;
playing to you from reeds and gardens,
evening storms
drenched the brassy umbels,
darkly they burst, taut with seeds,
and sea and strands,
wimpled with tents,
full of burning sand,
weeks bronzing, tanning everything
to pelts for kisses landing
indiscriminately like cloudbursts
and soon over!

Even then
a weight overhead
grapes bunching
you pulled down the boughs and let them bounce up,
only a few berries
if you wanted
first—

not yet so bulging and overhung with
plate-sized fruit,
old heavy grape flesh—

O those years!

                                 ii

Dark days of spring,
unyielding murk in the leaves;
drooping lilacs, barely looking up
narcissus color, and smelling strongly of death,
loss of content,
untriumphant sadness of the unfulfilled.

And in the rain
falling on the leaves,
I hear an old forest song,
from forests I crossed
and saw again, but I didn’t return
to the hall where they were singing,
the keys were silent,
the hands were resting somewhere
apart from the arms that held me,
moved me to tears,
hands from the eastern steppes,
long since trampled and bloody—
only the forest song
in the rain
dark days of spring
the everlasting steppes."
1986,The Watchman of Ephraim,Paul Hoover,"The workman made it; therefore it is not God          —Hosea

Hear the word of the Lord,
ye children of Pittsburgh, 
of Calistoga and Tlaquepaque,
ye hierophants and wishbones,
teraphim and household plants, 
for I am a jealous God betrayed.

My lover, whom I uplifted,
has fallen to other affections.
Weep for her outcast state,
for I rescind her corn and her fields, 
her appetites and her husbands, 
her loom and the cloth of her weaving; 
yea, as she sleeps in her bed,
I will crumble her idols of clay.

I will cause to burn in the night
her barns filled with swallows,
her caves of rodents and bats, 
her racks of sidereal dresses, 
her stacks of serpentine hats.

The velvet of her touch, once royal, 
I will scarify with my wrath.
for I am a god betrayed; my love
has reached into my weakness
and turned my heart like a fist. 

Therefore, I will strip her naked
and drive her into the field.
In her body of filth and feathers,
her blood of beasts and men, she is
my desolation and a forgotten name.

For my cosmos is contracted. 
My first world slips from my hands.
Tell the people, my prophet Hosea, 
that I loved her more than love,
and she gave not love in return.

My anger flattens and spreads
along the walls and windows.
It glances from my mirrors
and breaks the east wind’s bones.
I was a God of such strength
they could not guess my name.
And this woman of human warmth
suckled me like a child.

Now I dwell with the mole, blindly,
and my voice is thin as a gnat’s.
I grieve what grinds in me, heavily.
I am but a half note, half sung."
1987,The Amaranth,Matthew Rohrer,"is an imaginary flower that never fades.
The amaranth is blue with black petals,
it’s yellow with red petals,
it’s enormous and grows into the shape
of a girl’s house,
the seeds nestle high in the closet
where she hid a boy.
The boy and his bike flee
the girl’s parents from the tip
of the leaves, green summer light
behind the veins.
The amaranth is an imaginary flower
in the shape of a girl’s house
dispensing gin and tonics
from its thorns, a succulent.
This makes the boy’s bike steer
off-course all summer, following
the girl in her marvelous car,
the drunken bike.
 
He was a small part of summer,
he was summer’s tongue."
1988,"“An Archive of Confessions, A Genealogy of Confessions”",Joshua Clover,"Now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark
City under the strict surveillance of quotation marks.
 
The citizens with their cockades and free will drift off
From the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love.
 
In the far suburbs crenellated of Cartesian yards and gin
The tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in
 
Across the bluing evening. It’s the hour things get
To be excellently pointless, like describing the alphabet.
 
Yikes. It’s fine to be here with you watching the great events
Without taking part, clinking our ice as they advance
 
Yet remain distant. Like the baker always about to understand
Idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of Napoleon
 
In a baker’s life, always interrupted by the familiar notes
Of a childish song, “no more sleepy dreaming,” we float
 
Casually on the surface of the day, staring at the bottom,
Jotting in our daybooks, how beautiful, the armies of autumn."

1990,Childhood Stories,Matthew Rohrer,"They learned to turn off the gravity in an auditorium
and we all rose into the air,
the same room where they demonstrated
pow-wows and prestidigitation.
 
But not everyone believed it.
That was the most important lesson
I learned—that a truck driven by a dog
could roll down a hill at dusk
and roll right off a dock into a lake
and sink, and if no one believes you
then what is the point
of telling them wonderful things?
 
I walked home from the pow-wow
on an early winter night in amazement:
they let me buy the toy tomahawk!
As soon as I got home I was going
to hit my sister with it, but I didn’t know this."
1991,"Home Again, Home Again",Marilyn L. Taylor,"The children are back, the children are back—
They’ve come to take refuge, exhale and unpack;
The marriage has faltered, the job has gone bad,
Come open the door for them, Mother and Dad.

The city apartment is leaky and cold,
The landlord lascivious, greedy and old—
The mattress is lumpy, the oven’s encrusted,
The freezer, the fan, and the toilet have rusted.

The company caved, the boss went broke,
The job and the love affair, all up in smoke.
The anguish of loneliness comes as a shock—
 O heart in the doldrums, O heart in hock.

And so they return with their piles of possessions,
Their terrified cats and their mournful expressions,
Reclaiming the bedrooms they had in their teens,
Clean towels, warm comforter, glass figurines.

Downstairs in the kitchen the father and mother
Don’t say a word, but they look at each other
As down from the hill comes Jill, comes Jack.
 The children are back. The children are back."
1992,Precision German Craftsmanship,Matthew Rohrer,"It was a good day and I was about to do something important
and good, but then I unscrewed the pen I was using
to see the ink. Precision German craftsmanship.
The Germans are so persnickety and precise,
they wash their driveways. Their mountains and streams
dance around each other in a clockwork, courtly imitation
of spring. They build the Panzer tank, out of rakes
hoses and garden gnomes; they built me.
And I’ve seated myself above an avenue on the brink
of mystery, always just on the lip, with my toes over the lip
but my bowels behind.
 
When I replaced the ink the sky was socked in,
only one window of blue open in the north, directly over someone.
But that person was reading about Rosicrucians in the laundromat,
he was unaware as the blue window closed above him.
The rest of us are limp and damp,
I see a button in front of us that says “spin cycle.”
I’m going to push it."
1993,Shorter American Memory of the Declaration of Independence,Rosmarie Waldrop,"We holler these trysts to be self-exiled that all manatees are credited equi-distant, that they are endured by their Creditor with cervical unanswerable rims. that among these are lightning, lice, and the pushcart of harakiri. That to seduce these rims, graces are insulated among manatees, descanting their juvenile pragmatism from the consistency of the graced. That whenever any formula of grace becomes detained of these endives, it is the rim of the peppery to aluminize or to abominate it. and to insulate Newtonian grace. leaching its fountain pen on such printed matter and orienting its pragmatism in such formula, as to them shall seize most lilac to effuse their sage and harakiri."
1994,Valiant En Abyme,Joshua Clover,"Our grand peregrinations through these temporary cities,
These pale window box poppies of the laughing class,
Drifting as if time came in the same long dollops as starlight,
Resemble an epic journey as a coffee bean resembles a llama’s foot,
Though the kitchen table may be far from the desert
It’s near in spirit, a yellow oasis before the wind
Starts its restless sweeping of white flower-dust across the lintel,
Marking the fine edge of things like children asleep
At the opera, piled up near the door, summer passing
On its way out. Prince Valiant vowed to sew the horizons
Into a single idea, to put on the blue dress of distance,
Looping past rivers and mountains as one leaps from bed
To bed to make loneliness lonely, the suburbs were for him
A relief, a pageant of calm desire where he settled,
All the king’s horses grazing on forsythia out back
While the evening tilts back out of the night, a kindly drunk
Uncle, and asks you to stay. Was this the end of traveling?
Or just a change in the story over time, as for example how
 Tous les chevaux du roi become Josie and the Pussycats
From one version to the next? So all heroes are deranged
By something quite common yet unexpected, a constellation
Redrawn and named again through the stars
Above the porch don’t shift but seem to sink
Through winter’s pitcher of noircotic ink,
Leaving a single streetlight that burned happily,
Thinking it was the sun, after all it was the day
Of the night and turned the world around it,
We were good sentences and forgot where we started."
1995,What’s American About American Poetry?,Joshua Clover,"They basically grow it out of sand.
This is a big help because otherwise it was getting pretty enigmatic.
Welcome to the desert of the real,
I am an ephemeral and not too discontented citizen.
I do not think the revolution is finished.
So during these years, I lived in a country where I was little known,
With the thunder of the Gods that protect the Icelandic tundra from advertising,
Great red gods, great yellow gods, great green gods, planted at the edges of the speculative tracks along which the mind speeds from one feeling to another, from one idea to its consequence
Past the proud apartment houses, fat as a fat money bag. I wish that I might stay in this pleasant, conventional city,
A placid form, a modest form, but one with a claim to pleasure,
And then vanish in the fogs of hypnoLondon.
All are in their proper place in these optical whispering-galleries,
The swan-winged horses of the skies with summer’s music in their manes,
The basic Los Angeles Dingbat,
A housewife in any neighborhood in any city in any part of Mexico on a Saturday night.
Every Sunday is too little Sunday,
A living grave, the true grave of the head.
In one shout desire rises and dies.
Composed while I was asleep on horseback
I drift, mainly I drift."
1996,Bronzed,Dean Young,"That dusty bubble gum, once ubiquitous as starlings,  
is no more, my love. Whistling dinosaurs now populate  
only animation studios, the furious actions of angels  
causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist  
frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth.  
And the bus-station's old urinals go under  
the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers  
graduate into the wrinkle-causing sun. The sea  
seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one  
long goodbye, perpetually the tide recedes,  
beaches dotted with debris. Unto each is given  
a finite number of addresses, ditties to dart  
the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon.  
The sword's hilt glints, the daffodils bow down,  
all is temporary as a perfect haircut, a kitten  
in the lap, yet sitting here with you, my darling,  
waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw  
seems all eternity I'll ever need  
and all eternity needs of me."
1997,Salvage,Kay Ryan,"The wreck

The worst  
has happened.  
The salvage trucks  
back in and  
the salvage men

and stack,  
whistling as  
they work.  
Thanks be  
to god—again—  
for extractable elements  
which are not  
carriers of pain,  
for this periodic  
table at which  
the self-taught  
salvagers disassemble  
the unthinkable  
to the unthought."
1998,Thin,Kay Ryan,"How anything

Poised upside down on its duncecap,
a shrunken purple head,
True Blueberry,

In front of me Licorice teeters like a lump of coal
on its pinkish base of Pumpkin.
       A Rauschenberg tongue
       fondles this rich donnée,
       then begins to erase it.
 
Turning from all that is present
in the flesh, so to speak,
let the eye wander off to a menu,
where it can start to ingest
“Quite Sour Lemon sherbet
topped with a stem cherry and chocolate sprinkles
     Swilling in language,
all floating in bubbly cherry phosphate
      the bloated imagination 
      is urged to open still wider
      and shovel it in,
and served with a twist of pretzel.”
In this world “Creamy Vanilla and
Smooth Swiss Chocolate ice creams”
can be “blended with chopped pineapple,
dark fudge sauce, ripe bananas, whipped topping,
cookies, roasted nutmeats and nippy chopped cherries.”
     the Unconscious, that old hog,
     being in charge here of the 
     creative act.
 
At about the moment my tastebuds
receive a last tickle of Gingersnap
and begin to respond to
Orange Fudge, I look at you
who have bought my ice cream cones for twenty years,
     Moving another new ice to the mouth
     we needn’t remember
and look away
     it is always the same mouth
     that melts it.
My mind assembles a ribald tower
of sherbet dips, all on one cone,
Apricot, Apple, Tangerine, Peach, Prune, Lime,
and then it topples.
You are steadier than I.
You order one dip always,
or, in a dish, two dips of the same flavor.
 
In this hysterical brilliance of neon
     Come on, consumers, 
     we’ve got to keep scooping
it is twelve or fifteen of us
to thirty ice creams.
     so that the creams shall not rise
      like cold lava out of their bins,
      numbing our feet, our knees,
      freezing our chests, our chins, our eyes,
Open the door, quick,
and let in two handholding adolescents.
Coping with all those glands
makes them good and hungry.
     so that, flying out of their cannisters,
     the chopped nuts
     shall not top off our Technicolor grave
     with their oily ashes.
 
Listen! All around us toothsome cones
are suffering demolition
down to the last, nipple-like tip.
How do we know where to stop?
Perhaps the glasses and dishes
are moulded of candy, and the counters and windows…
       Over your half-eaten serving of Italian Delight,
       why are you looking at me
       the way you are looking at me?"
2000,The Miser,Mona Van Duyn,"I was out last night,
the very picture of a sneak, dark and hunched-over,
breaking and entering again.
Why do I do it?

And why, when I can afford serious residences,
do I keep to this one room?
Perhaps if I had not lost track of the difference
between the real and the ideal
it would never have happened.
I hide here almost entirely now.

When I go out, when I creep into those silent houses,
I steal newspapers.
An armload, no more than I can carry comfortably.
Sometimes they are already tied up
on the side porch or by the kitchen stove.
Nobody misses them.
They think each other or the maid
has carried them out to the street.

They say there is something intractable out there,
the Law, the Right to Privacy,
the World.
In the days when my obsession was only a wound-up toy,
squeaking and jabbering in my chest,
I could have believed them.

I sit by the window today
(There is very little space left now,
thought I have left corridors wide enough to walk through
so I won't lose touch)
holding my latest on my lap,
handling them, fondling them, taking in every column.
They are becoming more and more precious.

My delusion grows and spreads.
Lately it seems to me
as I read of murders, wars, bankruptcies, jackpot winnings,
the news is written in that perfect style
of someone speaking to the one
who knows and loves him.

Long before they miss me, I think,
the room will be perfectly solid.
When they break in the door and, unsurprised,
hardened to the most bizarre vagaries,
begin to carry out my treasure,
death's what they'll look for underneath it all,
those fluent, muscled, imaginative men,
sweating in their innocent coveralls.

But I will be out in broad daylight by then,
answering,
having accepted utterly the heart's conditions.
Tell them I wish them well, always,
that I've been happy."
2001,On What Planet,Kenneth Rexroth,"Uniformly over the whole countryside
The warm air flows imperceptibly seaward;
The autumn haze drifts in deep bands
Over the pale water;
White egrets stand in the blue marshes;
Tamalpais, Diablo, St. Helena
Float in the air.
Climbing on the cliffs of Hunter’s Hill
We look out over fifty miles of sinuous
Interpenetration of mountains and sea.
 
Leading up a twisted chimney,
Just as my eyes rise to the level
Of a small cave, two white owls
Fly out, silent, close to my face.
They hover, confused in the sunlight,
And disappear into the recesses of the cliff.
 
All day I have been watching a new climber,
A young girl with ash blonde hair
And gentle confident eyes.
She climbs slowly, precisely,
With unwasted grace.
 
While I am coiling the ropes,
Watching the spectacular sunset,
She turns to me and says, quietly,
“It must be very beautiful, the sunset,
On Saturn, with the rings and all the moons.”"
2002,A Time of Bees,Mona Van Duyn,"Love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.
                                                                        CAMUS

All day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch.
Screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened
keep the whole house tormented. He is trying to reach
the bees, he is after bees. This is the climax, an end
to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.

Last June on the porch floor I found them dead,
a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse
death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted,
I swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch,
I thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?

My life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. The search
was hopeless. Windows were shut. I never find
where anything comes from. But in June my husband’s fierce
sallies began, inspections, cracks located
and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees’ course
 
watched, charted; books on bees read.
I tell you I swept up bodies every day on the porch.
Then they’d stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again,
as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech
sleepers who live innocently in will and mind.
 
It is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers
that the bees were back, no surprise to me. But they had
left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs
so deathly faded. Gray bugs that the broom hunted
were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch
 
of heart takes place, or a great shift of season.
November it came to an end. No bees. And I could watch
the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land.
But this spring the thing began again, and his curse
went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.
 
It is the man who takes hold. I lived from bees, but his force
went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid.
And now in July he is tearing out the wall, and each
board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand.
It is quiet, has been quiet for a while. He calls me, and I march
 
from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged,
such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers—
dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared
together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares?
They go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said.
 
But there is more. Wouldn’t you think the bees had suffered
enough? This evening we go to a party, the breeze
dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed.
We tell our funny story about the bees.
At two in the morning we come home, and a friend,
 
a scientist, comes with us, in his car. We’re going to save
the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find
so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave
the rest. We hope that the neighbors are safe in bed,
taking no note of these private catastrophes.
 
He wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. Not a bad
thing to look into. In the night we rattle and raise
the lid of the garbage can. Flashlights in hand,
we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve
of happenings. I can’t touch it. I hate the self-examined
 
who’ve killed the self. The dead are darker, but the others have
moved in the ooze toward the next moment. My God
one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes.
Searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need
the idea of bees—and yet, under their touch, the craze
 
for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind.
The men do it. Making a claim on the future, as love
makes a claim on the future, grasping. And I, underhand,
I feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave
taking direction. Unpleading, the men prod
 
till all that grubby softness wants to give, to give."
2003,The Aunts,Joyce Sutphen,"I like it when they get together 
and talk in voices that sound 
like apple trees and grape vines,

and some of them wear hats 
and go to Arizona in the winter, 
and they all like to play cards.

They will always be the ones 
who say “It is time to go now,” 
even as we linger at the door,

or stand by the waiting cars, they 
remember someone—an uncle we 
never knew—and sigh, all

of them together, like wind 
in the oak trees behind the farm 
where they grew up—a place

I remember—especially 
the hen house and the soft 
clucking that filled the sunlit yard."
2004,The Synthetic A Priori,Kathleen Graber,"What objects may be in themselves, and apart from all     
     this receptivity of our sensibility, remains completely    
     unknown to us. We know nothing but our mode of     
     perceiving them. . . . With this alone have we     
     any concern.
     
     —Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason

At a church rummage sale, I study the perfection of shadows
in a painting by Caravaggio, although what I hold
is only a small print of Christ—its frame broken—dining
at Emmaus with three of the Apostles. And because the table
is dramatically, if not unbelievably, lit, the bowls & pitcher
& loaves send their dark crescents onto the immaculate
white cloth. When the Savior raises his hand to offer a blessing,
its shade deepens further his crimson smock. Tenebrosus:
that rich, convincing darkness. As though the master understood
that the obscured world only seems to us somehow
even more familiar, as though our sense of our own unknowing
had at last been made visible—even if what we do not know
cannot itself be seen. The future’s drape, the carnival fortunetellers
of my childhood might have called it, but also the now’s,
displayed as it is—so many unmatched cups & saucers, old coats
& wicker baskets—all around us. At a party last week,
someone said verisimilitude. We were huddled on a tiny porch.
It was the first cool night & the wine had no conclusion.
 
The talk turned quickly to shepherds & the pastoral & then,
to opera, before someone recalled a horror film he’d watched
late one night with his brother. In black & white vignettes,
an evil tree stump possessed by the spirit of an executed prince
hunts the scheming tribal elders who have destroyed him.
A former pro wrestler in a costume of wire & rubber bark
& wearing a permanent scowl lumbers after vengeance
in the confusion & fear of 1957 on a half-dozen root-legs,
driving his victims into quicksand or toppling himself over
upon him. Though here the point is the teller’s small brother
& the boy’s allegiance, even in a state of suspended disbelief,
to what we call sense. How, he wanted to know, suddenly
unusually earnest, did the tree manage to get itself up again?
 
Yesterday I spoke to a friend who is despairing: back home,
waiting tables, he’s dating a woman whose marriage has only
just come to an end. When he wakes, he discovers he does not
recognize himself. One afternoon, walking home from school,
I hit my best friend in the face with a book. It may well be
that she hit me. Thin pages flew out into the street. More punches
were thrown & I came away bruised. In that book, a novel
by Emily Brontë, the land is violent & unjust & we are violent
& unjust upon it. Even worse, our greatest passions
change nothing at all. Before one of us hit the other,
there must have been a cause, but I can’t recall it, which makes it
seem nonlinear now, &, thus, apocryphal, both impossible
& impossibly real. I failed, though I tried, to offer comfort.
 
It’s not that our lives don’t resemble our lives. I’ve been alone
so often lately I sometimes catch myself watching myself—
breathing in the fresh spears of rosemary or admiring the shallots,
peeling their translucent wrappers away, centering one on the board,
making the first careful cut, lifting the purple halves.
 
Before stories, we were too busy for stories, too busy
hunting & suffering to invent the tales of our own
resurrections. Caught out in the kitchen’s brightness last night,
the handle of the skillet cast its simple, perfected form
across the stove—pierced, like the eye of the needle, so that
it can be hung from a hook, as pans, presumably, have always been.
 
Outside the wind picked up. Thunder. The dog trotted off,
hid her head beneath the chair. But today: a charity sale
at Trinity Chapel & sun on the tar of the buckled walks.
In the cracks, beads of water spin into light. Tell yourself
it’s simple: this is where it’s been heading all along. Tell yourself
something you have no faith in has already begun to occur."
2005,Mysterious Neighbors,Connie Wanek,"Country people rise early 
as their distant lights testify. 
They don’t hold water in common. Each house 
has a personal source, like a bank account, 
a stone vault. Some share eggs, 
some share expertise, 
and some won’t even wave. 
A walk for the mail elevates the heart rate. 
Last November I saw a woman down the road 
walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange 
cap to boot, a cautious soul. 
Bullets can’t read her No Trespassing sign. 
Strange to think they’re in the air 
like lead bees with a fatal sting. 
Our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen 
with his rifle handy and the window open. 
You never know when. Once 
he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill. 
He’s in his seventies, born here, joined the Navy, 
came back. Hard work never hurt a man 
until suddenly he was another broken tool. 
His silhouette against the dawn 
droops as though drought-stricken, each step 
deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox, 
prying it open. Checking a trap."
2006,Destruction,Charles Baudelaire,"At my side the Demon writhes forever,
Swimming around me like impalpable air;
As I breathe, he burns my lungs like fever
And fills me with an eternal guilty desire.

Knowing my love of Art, he snares my senses,
Apearing in woman's most seductive forms,
And, under the sneak's plausible pretenses,
Lips grow accustomed to his lewd love-charms.

He leads me thus, far from the sight of God,
Panting and broken with fatigue into
The wilderness of Ennui, deserted and broad,

And into my bewildered eyes he throws
Visions of festering wounds and filthy clothes,
And all Destruction's bloody retinue."
2007,The Duck and the Kangaroo,Edward Lear,"I
  
 Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,
     ‘Good gracious! how you hop!
 Over the fields and the water too,
     As if you never would stop!
 My life is a bore in this nasty pond,
 And I long to go out in the world beyond!
     I wish I could hop like you!’
     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
  
  
 II
  
 ‘Please give me a ride on your back!’
     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
 ‘I would sit quite still, and say nothing but “Quack,”
     The whole of the long day through!
 And we’d go to the Dee, and the Jelly Bo Lee,
 Over the land, and over the sea;—
     Please take me a ride! O do!’
     Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.
  
  
 III
  
 Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,
     ‘This requires some little reflection;
 Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck,
     And there seems but one objection,
 Which is, if you’ll let me speak so bold,
 Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold,
 And would probably give me the roo-
     Matiz!’ said the Kangaroo.
  
  IV
  
 Said the Duck, ‘As I sate on the rocks,
     I have thought over that completely,
 And I bought four pairs of worsted socks
     Which fit my web-feet neatly.
 And to keep out the cold I’ve bought a cloak,
 And every day a cigar I’ll smoke,
     All to follow my own dear true
     Love of a Kangaroo!’
  
  
 V

 Said the Kangaroo, ‘I’m ready!
     All in the moonlight pale;
 But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!
     And quite at the end of my tail!’
 So away they went with a hop and a bound,
 And they hopped the whole world three times round;
     And who so happy,—O who,
     As the Duck and the Kangaroo?."
2008,The Flowers,Stéphane Mallarmé,"From golden showers of the ancient skies,
On the first day, and the eternal snow of stars,
You once unfastened giant calyxes
For the young earth still innocent of scars:
 
Young gladioli with the necks of swans,
Laurels divine, of exiled souls the dream,
Vermilion as the modesty of dawns
Trod by the footsteps of the seraphim;
 
The hyacinth, the myrtle gleaming bright,
And, like the flesh of woman, the cruel rose,
Hérodiade blooming in the garden light,
She that from wild and radiant blood arose!
 
And made the sobbing whiteness of the lily
That skims a sea of sighs, and as it wends
Through the blue incense of horizons, palely
Toward the weeping moon in dreams ascends!
 
Hosanna on the lute and in the censers,
Lady, and of our purgatorial groves!
Through heavenly evenings let the echoes answer,
Sparkling haloes, glances of rapturous love!
 
Mother, who in your strong and righteous bosom,
Formed calyxes balancing the future flask,
Capacious flowers with the deadly balsam
For the weary poet withering on the husk."
2009,Hérodiade,Stéphane Mallarmé,"I. ANCIENT OVERTURE OF HÉ﻿RODIADE
 
The Nurse
 
 (Incantation)
 
Abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears
Of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears,
The naked golds lashing the crimson space,
An Aurora—heraldic plumage—has chosen to embrace
Our cinerary tower of sacrifice,
Heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice
Of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes…
Ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes!
No splashing! the gloomy water, standing still,
No longer visited by snowy quill
Or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving
Of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving,
Of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb
Of its feathers, it buried its head, undone
By the pure diamond of a star, but one
Of long ago, which never even shone.
 
Crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre!
Empurpled sky, complicit in the mire,
And stained-glass windows opening red on carnage.
 
The strange chamber, framed in all the baggage
Of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint,
Has yesteryear’s snows instead of its ancient tint;
And its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases
With the buried eyes of prophetesses
Offering Magi withered fingers. One,
With floral past enwoven on my gown
Bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky
Bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery
Of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen,
An aroma, roses, rising from the hidden
Couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds,
An aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds,
A drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon
(Though the taper’s quenched, petals still fall from one),
Flowers whose long regrets and stems appear
Drenched in a lonely vase to languish there…
An Aurora dragged her wings in the basin’s tears!
 
Magical shadow with symbolic powers!
A voice from the distant past, an evocation,
Is it not mine prepared for incantation?
In the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed,
Lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed,
Spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold,
Through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds
Pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud
Through which the old veiled brightness is allowed
To mount, in desperation, shall arise
(But oh, the distance hidden in those cries!)
The old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver,
Of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar:
Will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor,
And, in the hour of its agony, render
Itself as the anthem for psalms of petition?
For all are alike in being brought to perdition
By the power of old silence and deepening gloom,
Fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone,
Like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond.
 
Sometimes she sang an incoherent song.
Lamentable sign!
                             the bed of vellum sheets,
Useless and closed–not linen!—vainly waits,
Bereft now of the cherished grammary
That spelled the figured folds of reverie,
The silken tent that harbored memory,
The fragrance of sleeping hair. Were these its treasure?
Cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure,
Shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn,
Or when the pomegranate’s flesh is torn
By wicked night! Alone, the crescent moon
On the iron clockface is a pendulum
Suspending Lucifer: the clepsydra pours
Dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours
As, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade
On undeciphered paths without a guide!
All this the king knows not, whose salary
Has fed so long this agèd breast now dry.
Her father knows it no more than the cruel
Glacier mirroring his arms of steel,
When sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins
Smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens
With dark silver trumpets the ancient pines!
Will he ever come back from the Cisalpines?
Soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding!
On the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according
To the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns,
And to an envious candle it turns
A finger. And soon, when the sad sun sinks,
It shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks!
No sunset, but the red awakening
Of the last day concluding everything
Struggles so sadly that time disappears,
The redness of apocalypse, whose tears
Fall on the child, exiled to her own proud
Heart, as the swan makes its plumage a shroud
For its eyes, the old swan, and is carried away
From the plumage of grief to the eternal highway
Of its hopes, where it looks on the diamonds divine
Of a moribund star, which never more shall shine!"
2010,The Jumblies,Edward Lear,"I
  
 They went to sea in a Sieve, they did,
    In a Sieve they went to sea:
 In spite of all their friends could say,
 On a winter’s morn, on a stormy day,
    In a Sieve they went to sea!
 And when the Sieve turned round and round,
 And every one cried, ‘You’ll all be drowned!’
 They called aloud, ‘Our Sieve ain’t big,
 But we don’t care a button! we don’t care a fig!
    In a Sieve we’ll go to sea!’
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 II
  
 They sailed away in a Sieve, they did,
    In a Sieve they sailed so fast,
 With only a beautiful pea-green veil
 Tied with a riband by way of a sail,
    To a small tobacco-pipe mast;
 And every one said, who saw them go,
 ‘O won’t they be soon upset, you know!
 For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long,
 And happen what may, it’s extremely wrong
    In a Sieve to sail so fast!’
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 III
  
 The water it soon came in, it did,
    The water it soon came in;
 So to keep them dry, they wrapped their feet
 In a pinky paper all folded neat,
    And they fastened it down with a pin.
 And they passed the night in a crockery-jar,
 And each of them said, ‘How wise we are!
 Though the sky be dark, and the voyage be long,
 Yet we never can think we were rash or wrong,
    While round in our Sieve we spin!’
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 IV
  
 And all night long they sailed away;
    And when the sun went down,
 They whistled and warbled a moony song
 To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,
    In the shade of the mountains brown.
 ‘O Timballo! How happy we are,
 When we live in a sieve and a crockery-jar,
 And all night long in the moonlight pale,
 We sail away with a pea-green sail,
    In the shade of the mountains brown!’
      Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
      Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 V
  
 They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,
    To a land all covered with trees,
 And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,
 And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,
    And a hive of silvery Bees.
 And they bought a Pig, and some green Jack-daws,
 And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,
 And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,
    And no end of Stilton Cheese.
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve.
  
  
 VI
  
 And in twenty years they all came back,
    In twenty years or more,
 And every one said, ‘How tall they’ve grown!’
 For they’ve been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,
    And the hills of the Chankly Bore;
 And they drank their health, and gave them a feast
 Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;
 And everyone said, ‘If we only live,
 We too will go to sea in a Sieve,—
    To the hills of the Chankly Bore!’
       Far and few, far and few,
          Are the lands where the Jumblies live;
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,
          And they went to sea in a Sieve."
2011,The Pipe,Stéphane Mallarmé,"Yesterday I found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Thrown aside were my cigarettes, with all the childish joys of summer, into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun, the muslins, illuminate, and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed, so as better to work: but I was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me; for hardly had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I was planning to write, and, amazed, moved to a feeling of tenderness, I breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me. I had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to France, and now all of London, London as I had lived it a year ago entirely alone, appeared before my eyes: first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements. My tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust, on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch; the big fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morning—when the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive! Once again I saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted square—I saw the open sea, crossed so often that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumes—with my poor wandering beloved, decked out in traveller’s clothes, a long dress, dull as the dust of the roads, a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival, mangled as they are by the sea, and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever."
2012,The Ragpickers' Wine,Charles Baudelaire,"In the muddy maze of some old neighborhood,
Often, where the street lamp gleams like blood,
As the wind whips the flame, rattles the glass,
Where human beings ferment in a stormy mass,

One sees a ragpicker knocking against the walls,
Paying no heed to the spies of the cops, his thralls,
But stumbling like a poet lost in dreams;
He pours his heart out in stupendous schemes.

He takes great oaths and dictates sublime laws,
Casts down the wicked, aids the victims' cause;
Beneath the sky, like a vast canopy,
He is drunken of his splendid qualities.

Yes, these people, plagued by household cares,
Bruised by hard work, tormented by their years,
Each bent double by the junk he carries,
The jumbled vomit of enormous Paris,—

They come back, perfumed with the smell of stale
Wine-barrels, followed by old comrades, pale
From war, mustaches like limp flags, to march
With banners, flowers, through the triumphal arch

Erected for them, by some magic touch!
And in the dazzling, deafening debauch
Of bugles, sunlight, of huzzas and drum,
Bring glory to the love-drunk folks at home!

Even so, wine pours its gold to frivolous
Humanity, a shining Pactolus;
Then through man's throat of high exploits it sings
And by its gifts reigns like authentic kings.

To lull these wretches' sloth and drown the hate
Of all who mutely die, compassionate,
God has created sleep's oblivion;
Man added Wine, divine child of the Sun."
2013,The Table and the Chair,Edward Lear,"I

Said the Table to the Chair,
'You can hardly be aware,
'How I suffer from the heat,
'And from chilblains on my feet!
'If we took a little walk,
'We might have a little talk!
'Pray let us take the air!'
Said the Table to the Chair.

II

Said the Chair unto the Table,
'Now you know we are not able!
'How foolishly you talk,
'When you know we cannot walk!'
Said the Table, with a sigh,
'It can do no harm to try,
'I've as many legs as you,
'Why can't we walk on two?'

III

So they both went slowly down,
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound,
As they toddled round and round.
And everybody cried,
As they hastened to their side,
'See! the Table and the Chair
'Have come out to take the air!'

IV

But in going down an alley,
To a castle in a valley,
They completely lost their way,
And wandered all the day,
Till, to see them safely back,
They paid a Ducky-quack,
And a Beetle, and a Mouse,
Who took them to their house.

V

Then they whispered to each other,
'O delightful little brother!
'What a lovely walk we've taken!
'Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'
So the Ducky, and the leetle
Browny-Mousy and the Beetle
Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled to their beds."
2014,Brief Eden,Lois Beebe Hayna,"For part of one strange year we lived
in a small house at the edge of a wood.
No neighbors, which suited us. Nobody
to ask questions. Except
for the one big question we went on
asking ourselves.
                         That spring
myriads of birds stopped over
briefly. Birds we’d never seen before, drawn
to our leafy quiet and our brook and because,
as we later learned, the place lay beneath
a flyway. Flocks appeared overnight—birds
brilliant or dull, with sharp beaks
or crossed bills, birds small
and enormous, all of them pausing
to gorge at the feeder, to rest their wings,
and disappear. Each flock seemed surer than we
of a destination. By the time we’d watched them
wing north in spring, then make
an anxious autumn return,
we too had pulled it together and we too moved
into what seemed to be our lives."
2016,April,Alicia Ostriker,"The optimists among us
taking heart because it is spring
skip along
attending their meetings
signing their e-mail petitions
marching with their satiric signs
singing their we shall overcome songs
posting their pungent twitters and blogs
believing in a better world
for no good reason
I envy them
said the old woman

The seasons go round they
go round and around
said the tulip
dancing among her friends
in their brown bed in the sun
in the April breeze
under a maple canopy
that was also dancing
only with greater motions
casting greater shadows
and the grass
hardly stirring

What a concerto
of good stinks said the dog
trotting along Riverside Drive
in the early spring afternoon
sniffing this way and that
how gratifying the cellos of the river
the tubas of the traffic
the trombones
of the leafing elms with the legato
of my rivals’ piss at their feet
and the leftover meat and grease
singing along in all the wastebaskets"
2017,Argyle on Knocknagaroon,Thomas P. Lynch,"Because he barely heard the voice of God
above the hum of other choristers—
batwing and bird-whistle, gathering thunder,
the hiss of tides retreating, children, cattle;
because he could not readily discern
the plan Whoever Is In Charge Here has,
he wondered about those who claimed to have
blessed assurances or certainty:
a One and Only Way and Truth and Life,
as if Whatever Breathes in Everything  
mightn’t speak in every wondrous tongue;
as if, of all creations, only one
made any sense. It made no sense to him.  
Hunger he understood, touch, desire.  
He knew the tenderness humans could do,
no less brutalities.  He knew the cold
morning, the broad meadow, the gold sunset.
One evening on the hill of Knocknagaroon,
the Atlantic on one side, the Shannon 
on the other, the narrowing headlands
of the peninsula out behind him,
the broad green palm of Moveen before him,
it seemed he occupied the hand of God:
open, upturned, outstretched, uplifting him."
2018,The Church of the Open Crayon Box,Patricia Lockwood,"Must be entered through the sharpener every Sunday,
else your name will be lovingly written in the Book 
of the Down Arrow. The One Steeple to Every Church 
                                                 rule breaks in half
in the Church of the Open Crayon Box; the One Bell
to Every Steeple rule breaks off its tip. “Climb stairs 
to the steeples,” the preacher commands, “and let 
every belltone ring out!” You can see the whole town
from the steeple, and you exit the church through 
the view, and you walk through what calls itself 

                                      Flagpole—the town is a blot 
                                      on the town, but the railroad 
is coming out this way and we must give them a smear 
to see through the windows: now you pass the General Store, 
that even your vaguest stick figure can enter, now you pass 
a vacant lot: the post office isn’t here yet, is only a set-aside space 
in the center of the country’s envelope; now you pass the voting-
place, where we stuff our handwriting through a slit. Tall trees 
fall in the pinewoods, tall telegraph poles are raised, and words 
inch along our wires: text text text stop, text text text stop.

And now you pass the Feed Store, which sells carrot and turnip 
and sugar-beet tops—only the visible parts—and now Whitey 
BaLavender’s Hardware, where everything hangs off the hook 
of its color, or color hangs off the hook of its all, where you work 
your hands into cool washers, and work hands into nailheads 
of the color blue, and watch Whitey BaLavender busy himself 
          pouring crayons into bullet molds. You show him a list 
          that says “ax,” and he sells you a red line through it.
                     All up and down Main Street ponies are covered 
                     with strokes as coarse as horse blankets. And once 
          you have drawn the ponies you begin to draw the saddle 
shop, you grip the right color like a saddle horn and somehow 
keep from falling off, and you ride to the edge of town, 
where you draw the fur trading post, where they sell tails 
of any shy animal, the rest of the animal gone down a hole, 
where you trade in your skin for a possibles bag and wear 
possibles bag where your skin was. Fat geese fly in any letter 
you like but you need red meat for once, and write a splayed-
hide word like “Deerslayer,” and take hold of the ending
                                                         and drag it home,

and now you are almost there, now you are building the home 
with hand-drawn Log Cabin Font, you are building it log 
by log of course and smoothing the logs with a color called 
Adze, you are biting the crayon to notch the logs and driving 
in dots of nailheads. Stumps of umber surround you, and the sky
is beginning to look like sky. You are hoping a man can be really
          alone here; 
                            you are hoping your father can tell what it is;
and now only the doorknob is left to draw and in your enthusiasm 
you shout at the paper, and the weather
                            changes just in time, not raining, beginning to spit."
2019,Departures: Chapter One,Lisa Russ Spaar,"Morning’s mirage, disdainful & calm
          as a mirror,

held the shorn bush that yesterday
          flourished,

now lopped canes & a scant spitfall
          of remnance,

confetti trampled in the clefts
          of vanishing deer.

To touch its truth I punched my fist
          into the chopped molest,

the boscage—withdrew my red sleeve.
          Abstract that."
2020,En Eski Aşk Şiiri,Jessica Jopp,"The Oldest Love Poem(For Susan)

Back from Istanbul, she gives to me
the photograph she took inside
the Archaeological Museum’s
blue tiled hush, of a tablet
carved in terra cotta from Nippur,
written in Sumerian.

Delicate etches, a lift of riverbed
where the summer waters ran
glistened on this piece of earth
the earnest working hand,
a pause between the lines to contemplate
cedars’ ornate overhanging
leaf-work become inseparable
from the carving.  Maybe reading sky,
reading wind, or tree sounds
beside the sound of clay
shaped to carry a human mark.

Maybe it says     we are so elegant
in our exchange that looking at each other
the trees whisper their contented green
across any distance to be here
branches heat-satiated
full in our veins of holding.

Maybe it says      when we spoon,
we spoon each other a river
we find in our arms the curving
edges of the loving bed
become a shadowed riverbank
from which night animals will bend
and from our abundant dreams
to ease their thirst, will drink.

Maybe it says      in our hands
the night sky we first held
between us in the glowing
amorphous float reaches
the underside of leaves
as every sentry in the moon’s keep
finds more of it to give away

tonight again the fragrant sky
etches luminous travel
with beads from tree to tree
above this terra cotta,
above us as we sleep."
2021,He Considers Not the Lilies but Their Excellencies,Thomas P. Lynch,"Thin gruel, shallow graves, whiskey watered down,
the ne’er-do-well and good-for-nothing crowd
of cornerboys and gobshites were among
Argyle’s manifold perturbations.
Worse still, the episcopal vexations: 
their excellencies, eminence and graces,
red-cassocked dandies and mitered wankers,
the croziered posers in their bishoprics 
with their Easter duties and Peter’s pence,
their ledgers full of mortal, venial sins—
keepers of the till and tally, bankers
of indulgences and dispensations;
their bulls and bans and excommunications,
nothing but contumely and bamboozles.
For all their vestiture, rings and unctions,
preaching to bishops, like farting at skunks, was 
nothing but a mug’s game to the sin-eater,
so in earshot of them mum is what he kept. 
Still, he thought there might be something to it:
a life apart from this life where the souls
long dead and gone were neither dead nor gone.
Some days he felt so happily haunted,
by loving ghosts and gods upholding him.
Some days he felt entirely alone."
2022,He Posits Certain Mysteries,Thomas P. Lynch,"The body of the boy who took his flight
off the cliff at Kilcloher into the sea
was hauled up by curragh-men, out at first light
fishing mackerel in the estuary.
“No requiem or rosary” said the priest,
“nor consecrated ground for burial,”
as if the boy had flown outside the pale
of mercy or redemption or God’s love.  
“Forgive them, for they know not what they do,”
quoth Argyle to the corpse’s people,
who heard in what he said a sort of riddle,
as if he meant their coreligionists
and not their sodden, sadly broken boy.
Either way, they took some comfort in it
and readied better than accustomed fare
of food and spirits; by their own reckoning:
the greater sin, the greater so the toll.
But Argyle refused their shilling coin
and helped them build a box and dig a grave.
“Your boy’s no profligate or prodigal,”
he said, “only a wounded pilgrim like us all.
What say his leaping was a leap of faith,
into his father’s beckoning embrace?”
They killed no fatted calf.  They filled the hole."
2023,His Ambulations,Thomas P. Lynch,"On shanks’ mare Argyle talked to himself.
Alone, he’d carry on whole colloquies
en route to some poor corpse’s obsequies—
these dialogues, the way he kept his wits
about him, body and soul together,
fit for the wretched work of sin-eating.
Sometimes he counted words or parts of words
as if they amounted to something more
than sound and sense attuned between his ears,
as, for example, how coincident:
the way grace and gratis, wherefore gratitude
partook a kinship such as cousins do,
singing the same tune in different voices,
much as grave and gravitas, then gravity
kept one earthbound, grounded, humble as the mud—
the humus, so-called, God wrought humans from. 
Or how from Adam’s rib was fashioned Eve—
bone of his own bone, flesh of his flesh—
whom he got gravid by implanting seed,
in her unfathomably fecund Eden.
The memory of a woman’s company
would bring his ambulations to a halt
to aim his gaping face due heavenward, 
the dewy air her touch, her taste, sweet salt."
2024,In Every Life,Alicia Ostriker,"In every life there’s a moment or two
when the self disappears, the cruel wound
takes over, and then again
at times we are filled with sky
or with birds or
simply with the sugary tea on the table
said the old woman

I know what you mean said the tulip
about epiphanies
for instance a cloudless April sky
the approach of a butterfly
but as to the disappearing self
no
I have not yet experienced that

You are creating distinctions
that do not exist in reality
where “self” and “not-self” are like salt
in ocean, cloud in sky
oxygen in fire

under the table scratching his balls"
2025,Midas Passional,Lisa Russ Spaar,"No one has touched me for weeks
yet in this drugged, gilt afternoon, late,

when nothing is safe, I’m paralyzed,
as though so wildly desired—passing solo through the garden’s

cinnamon, marigolds, famished roses, where a matted shingle
of the swept-up human hair I begged from a local beauty shop

& spread out fruitlessly among the blooms & canes
to keep away the deer might well be a satyr

passed out in the palace’s candied gold—
that something regnant with a strange, godlike power

could not help but reach out from the umbral blue
to tap my white arm. It is a day to die,

the light autoerotic, theatrical, with an unbearable listing,
stalled in cusp, in leonine torpor. Is courage artifice?

As though to answer were within my means.
Or to even move my mouth."
2026,"November, Late in the Day",John M. Ridland,"So this is aging: the bare sun, skinned,
palely bucking the dark wind,
slides through the glass, crawls on the carpet,
climbs the footboard, lies crosswise on the blanket,
a spoiled dog waiting to be fed.

Not now, dear warmth. The kindling’s in the shed,
too far to fetch. Those two great logs that close
together to make fire, repose
apart, an old couple reminiscing
on conflagrations they’re now missing:
how every sunny Saturday afternoon,
Hey, diddle-diddle, the dish ran away with the spoon.

Not yet, dear spoon. Some hotter day, dear dish.
No tidbits now. Instead, let’s make a wish,
and boil fresh water for the small teapot
to keep it piping hot."
2027,Petition,Andrea Cohen,"After Elinor Lipper

The creature that had once
been a man handed over his petition,
a stained and grimy scrap,
handed it to his lord and master,
a petition asking to be transferred
to the status of a horse.
You son-of-a-whore, the master,
kicking for good measure, bellowed.
What do you mean by this?
The creature that had once
been a man, having considered
deeply his petition, answered:
If I were a horse, I would have
one day off in ten. As is,
I have none. As a horse,
I could rest now and again
during work. As a former
man, I cannot. As a horse,
I would be expected to perform
work equal to my strength.
As a prisoner, I am always
hungry, and hungry, I 
work less and get less 
bread, so I can barely stand.
A horse gets a stable
and two blankets. I have
no blankets, no jacket.
If a driver beats
a horse too hard, he 
is punished, for a horse 
is precious. If the brigadiers
beat and kick me, it is like
beating a tree. So you see,
a prisoner is nothing here.
But a horse? 
A horse is something!
Inside the frozen
and the broken 
vista, the plea had a ring 
of truth heard
even by the lord
and master, who had 
previously been a man himself, 
and who, when no other 
former men could see, 
attached that name 
to the page, granting
the horse a stable and two blankets."
2028,Slieve Donard II,Todd Swift,"The suite on the side
facing away from the sea
is the suite with the fireplace
and two plasma screen tvs.
Better luxury compensates
for lack of view. Before
the perpetual gas fire, stunned
as if into stone, entering

as you enter your Anne Brontë,
a world muted, chemically arranged,
I try renewal of a mind remade.
Mind is book is water is fire, all change.
Fear is the wake-up call at three,
too early, for planes. Airport quiet.
Leave the hotel without baggage, fly
direct to Geneva. They await you there.

What occurs is only the turning of a page,
imagined for screen. Unseen is greater.
Is attested to, as we rise in Mass.
Water should be avoided by all those
who get into difficulty with ease, and cats.
Searching for the blackberry in the fur-lined
coat, I roam and ring, opening
a closet, from which tumbles a victim,

providing a fitting climax. Mrs. Pontifax
is staying across the hall. The glamour.
She is the Minister of Finance’s daughter.
She sees the cold winter sea rise from her vantage.
Our age is blinded by celebrity, seeing
with the gilded orb of a bronze, dull god.
The domes of our room service cool
after we have slaked and fed. As you read
this becomes the first one written under the influence
of an anti-depressed self, whatever that is to be.
What is, is taken off a shelf, a remaining wrack
that half emerges from the brackish ruins of the year.
Will love reunite?
Will Ireland be solvent?
All nights, holiest, least holy,
be still, be silent.

 Ireland, Christmas 2009"
2029,A Small Story about the Sky,Alberto Ríos,"The fire was so fierce, 
So red, so gray, so yellow
That, along with the land,
It burned part of the sky
Which stayed black in that corner 
For years,
As if it were night there
Even in the daytime, 
A piece of the sky burnt
And which then 
Could not be counted on
Even by the birds.

It was a regular fire—
Terrible—we forget this
About fire—terrible
And full of pride.  
It intended to be
Big, no regular fire.  
Like so many of us,
It intended to be more
And this time was.
It was not better or worse
Than any other fire
Growing up.  
But this time, it was a fire
At just the right time 
And in just the right place—
If you think like a fire—
A place it could do something big.

Its flames reached out
With ten thousand pincers, 
As if the fire
Were made of beetles and scorpions
Clawing themselves to get up,
Pinching the air itself
And climbing, 
So many sharp animals
On each other’s backs
Then into the air itself, 
Ten thousand snaps and pinches
At least,
So that if the sky 
Was made of something,
It could not get away this time.

Finally the fire 
Caught the sky,
Which acted like a slow rabbit 
Which had made a miscalculation.
It didn’t believe this could happen 
And so it ran left,
Right into the thin toothpicks of flames,
Too fast to pull back,
The sky with all its arms,
Hands, fingers, fingernails,
All of it
Disappeared.  
Goodbye.

The sky stayed black
For several years after.
I wanted to tell you
This small story
About the sky.
It’s a good one
And explains why the sky
Comes so slowly in the morning,
Still unsure of what’s here.  
But the story is not mine.
It was written by fire,
That same small fire
That wanted to come home
With something of its own
To tell,
And it did,
A small piece of blue in its mouth."

2031,Song,Alicia Ostriker,"Some claim the origin of song

some say it was a rhyme
telling the farmers when to plant and reap

factor generating my delight in being
alive this springtime
is the birdsong

Bountiful, playing pain.
These are my children
In my head. Unbegotten.

To have the future
Born forgotten."
2033,Stabile,Ange Mlinko,"I wake to light jackhammering, and news
follows: a plane
failed over the sea. All want to go home, but drastic curfews
obtain from a meridian.

                                      *     *     *

We are a long way from a sea that cedes
black boxes from an area
forested as the Andes. Instead, a Mercedes,
black as La Brea,
leaps from the backlit red, anonymous,
when we try to cross
at the traffic island discarding hibiscus
with every wind-toss.

                                      *     *     *

We are a long way from the courteous lilac

is tipped by a coxswain."
2034,Symphonic Expanse,Ange Mlinko,"If you’d seen 
the Gaillardots’ mullein in the Cedars of the Shouf; 
if you’d seen the Aleppo dock, red with iron, 
in Bcharre where the Adonis River’s said to run as red 

with what was 
thought his blood; if you’d seen the bearded oat in Burjein, 
the rayed white horehound in Tripoli; or maybe 
the milkwort in Ehden, as often I saw the strigose bellflower 

and the cyclamen, 
you might have been the more awed by a mallow-leaved 
bindweed in Aley on your way to the brunnera in Baalbek. 
The Mediterranean poppy in Nabatieh, Beirut mullein 

in nearby Baabda, 
connate Alexanders in Qadisha, fodder vetch in Zgharta,
white rocket in Sour, Gypsywort in Marjeyoun, 
headed Ziziphora in Baakleen, bladder skullcap in Barouk. 

The viscid catchfly, 
ah, vying with bats at evening in Zahle—for these the earth 
of continuous habitation since the Chalcolithic Age 
salivates at dawn. But not a reed grows where no grave is. 

In Sacandaga Valley,
two thousand bodies were trans-buried by the boneyard gang. 
They ceded the pitted ground to the dentist gang, 
whose jackhammers drilled the rock beneath.

Powder monkeys tamped 
the holes with dynamite. The beaver-tooth gang’s axes 
and cross-cut saws cleared the trees. Bush burners followed. 
The fires burned for two years. The patience of dam builders 

built a force 
equal to the water: It flooded the ashes, the railroad station, 
and a train, which I saw transposed in the steely swells, 
or so it seemed. But iron turns a torrent red."
2035,To the Young Man on the Bridge,Jessica Jopp,"The newspaper caption read: “Two  officers talk to a young man, name withheld, as he stands on a bridge  above the Merrimack River, distraught over learning that his mother is  terminally ill.”

When I first saw you 
I could glance up from your image in the paper
and out her kitchen doorway watch
my mother trim her artemisia,
scraps of silver trailing
her green wheelbarrow.
And I imagined yes,
if mine were dying,
I would be on the abutment too,
about to release the cable
ignoring those attempting rescue;
imagined your rock-weight drop
pierce Merrimack gray
driving you through layers of silt and barge wake
till your heart burst
its knot of color
oiled into molecular black.

And now that, years later, I have lost mine,
also to disease, I see your face again
transfixed in white and black,
a pale sphere caught
in the newspaper’s grainy net.
But now I would coax you back
from the railing to tell you:
no matter the number of months that have passed,
what whole rounded year has slipped
a marble from my pocket,
there is a moment of breaking
the surface of whatever hour
and plunging past the floating glass
of doorknobs turned in pain
light shafts driven
further into the enamel
of an incandescent pedal Singer
rimmed in chrome and folds of cloth
whose scent can still drown me
in green oblivion. Floating too
an azure button, despair complete
in its perfect disc, terra cotta saucer
lifted by her hand
with a border of fine red leaves
each holding its breath for all of us,
holding our grief.

                      I would say to you:
that impossible weight
will drop you every day
and arrows of color pierce
your body clear through, the river
for which you might stay."
2036,Travel Papers,Carolyn Forché,"Au silence de celle qui laisse rêveur. —René Char

By boat to Seurasaari where 
the small fish were called vendace.  
A man blew a horn of birchwood 
toward the nightless sea.

Still voice. Fire that is no fire. 
Ahead years unknown to be lived—

Bells from the tower in the all-at-once, then 
one by one, hours. Outside 
(so fleetingly) ourselves—

In a still mirror, in a blue within 
where this earthly journey dreaming
itself begins,

thought into being from the hidden to the end of the visible.

Mountains before and behind, 
heather and lichen, yarrow, gorse,
then a sea village of chartreuse fronds.

Spent fuel, burnt
wind, mute swans.

 We drove the birch-lined 
highway from Dresden 
to Berlin behind armored 
cars in late afternoon, 
nineteenth of June, passing 
the black cloud of a freight 
truck from Budapest.

Through disappearing
villages, past horses grazing vanished fields.

The year before you died, America 
went to war again on the other 
side of the world.
This is how the earth becomes, 
you said, a grotto of skeletons.

 In the ruins of a station: a soaked 
bed, broken chairs, a dead coal stove.

White weather, chalk and basalt, 
puffins, fuchsia and history shot 
through with particles 
of recognition: this one 
wetted down with petrol then 
set alight, that one taking 
forty rounds, this other 
found eleven years later in a bog.

In the station house, imaginary 
maps, smoke chased by wind, a registry 
of arrivals, the logs of ghost 
ships and a few prison 
diaries written on tissue paper.

Do you remember the blue-leaved lilies?   
The grotto, the hoarfrost, the frieze?  

Through the casements of glass hand-blown 
before the war, a birch tree lets snow drop 
through its limbs onto other birches. Birch twigs
in wind through glass.

Who were we then? Such 
a laughter as morning peeled 
its light from us!   

You said the cemeteries were full in a voice 
like wind plaiting willows—fields in bloom 
but silent without grasshoppers or bees.  
What do you want then? You with your 

neverness, your unknown, 
your book of things, you
with once years ahead to be lived.

Your father believes he took you 
with him, that you are
in an urn beside your sleeping mother
but I am still writing with your hand,
as you stand in your still-there of lighted words.

Such is the piano’s sadness and the rifle’s moonlight.  
Stairwells remember as do doors, but windows do not—

do not, upon waking, gaze out a window 
if you wish to remember your dream

An ache of hope that you will come back—
the cawing flock is not your coming.

Did you float toward Salzburg? A wind
in the mustard fields?—or walk instead 
beside me through the asylum in Krakow?   
Hours after your death you seemed 
everywhere at once like the swifts at twilight.  
Now your moments are clouds
in a photograph of swifts. 

In the hour held 
open between day and night under 
the meteor showers of Perseid
we held each other for the last time.

Dead, you whispered where is the road?  

There, through the last of the sentences, just there—
through the last of the sentences, the road—"
2037,Why Poetry Cannot Be Skimmed,Jessica Jopp,"In response to a student who told me he just “skims” the poetry right before class

The barn was in the Netherlands,
in a field where fierce night wind
caught the straw as if to fuse
the winter stars to their coldness.
A farmer, woken by the sound, knowing
his animals would be agitated,
walked to the barn and by lantern
brushed the tails of his horses.
In calming them he gathered
many long, gleaming strands
of their nut-brown hair. Given over
to what he heard in the swishing of their tails—
the lash, the taut string of grief, turned slow,
persistence turned to rhythmic movement—
he hoped that if he listened long enough
the layered sound would become a salve.
He rolled the strands together, laid out
along the windowsills of the barn.

Then, once dry enough in spring,
he rolled them in paraffin wax
to preserve the sound
and left them to absorb
all the varied rays of sun, the spills
of rain, and then snow flying fast
across the latched windows and the slats,
the rhythm of other breathing,
animals plodding by the barn walls.
The wax melted as the years progressed
and other horses resided in the stalls,
and their tail strands were added
to the aging threads.  From that encased sound
deepening over years, a rope,
pulled strong and taut, would resonate.

Then another generation worked the land
and waxed the horse-tail cord again,
and in turn when it caught
that century’s light, was spun
into amber. Woven into the cells of hair:
the tones of canal and field,
pasture, furrows of plough,
leaf and shadow, straw and stone,
the human calling, the animal uttering.
And when melted again, incrementally
strands from other horses living there
were added until there were enough
layers of sound, set with the nourishment
of grass and salt, to be given away
and the space the hair had occupied
would be returned to emptiness.

The horse-hair cord was brought
by a farmer to a luthier’s shop
along a canal, and it was a perfect fit,
she said, for a violin bow
she had carved a few months earlier,
waiting, and for the bow-less violin
someone had just given her.  She knew
rosin carrying a current through
pastures, filled thirst, and the grief
of night wind and scavenged apples
made the gathered pieces a whole.

And now they are together in your hands
this moment to make
unrehearsed, immediate,
after all those animals’ years,
when you bring the instrument to your chin,
when you raise the hair-strung bow,
again their elemental sounding,
and then their measured note, their first."
2038,Remaking a Neglected Orchard,Nathaniel Perry,"It was a good idea, cutting away
the vines and ivy, trimming back 
the chest-high thicket lazy years 
had let grow here. Though it wasn’t for lack

of love for the trees, I’d like to point out. 
Years love trees in a way we can’t 
imagine. They just don’t use the fruit 
like us; they want instead the slant

of sun through narrow branches, the buckshot 
of rain on these old cherries. And we, 
now that I think on it, want those 
things too, we just always and desperately

want the sugar of the fruit, the best 
we’ll get from this irascible land: 
sweetness we can gather for years, 
new stains staining the stains on our hands."
2039,Picasso,Tim Nolan,"How can we believe he did it— 
every day—for all those years?

We remember how the musicians 
gathered for him—and the prostitutes

arranged themselves the way he wanted— 
and even the helmeted monkeys

with their little toy car cerebella— 
posed—and the fish on the plate—

remained after he ate the fish— 
Bones—What do we do with this

life?—except announce: Joy. 
Joy. Joy—from the lead—

to the oil—to the stretch of bright 
canvas—stretched—to the end of it all."
2040,Canto I,Ezra Pound,"And then went down to the ship,
Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas,
Circe’s this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day’s end.
Sun to his slumber, shadows o’er all the ocean,
Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities
Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
With glitter of sun-rays
Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven
Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.
The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place
Aforesaid by Circe.
Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,
And drawing sword from my hip
I dug the ell-square pitkin;
Poured we libations unto each the dead,
First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour.
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death’s-heads;
As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods,
A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep.
Dark blood flowed in the fosse,
Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides
Of youths and of the old who had borne much;
Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender,
Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,
These many crowded about me; with shouting,
Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;
Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine;
Unsheathed the narrow sword,
I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,
Till I should hear Tiresias.
But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,
Unburied, cast on the wide earth,
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other.
Pitiful spirit.   And I cried in hurried speech:
“Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
“Cam’st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?”
              And he in heavy speech:
“Ill fate and abundant wine.    I slept in Circe’s ingle.
“Going down the long ladder unguarded,
“I fell against the buttress,
“Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.
“But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied,
“Heap up mine arms, be tomb by sea-bord, and inscribed:
 “A man of no fortune, and with a name to come. 
“And set my oar up, that I swung mid fellows.”
 
And Anticlea came, whom I beat off, and then Tiresias Theban,
Holding his golden wand, knew me, and spoke first:
“A second time? why? man of ill star,
“Facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
“Stand from the fosse, leave me my bloody bever
“For soothsay.”
               And I stepped back,
And he strong with the blood, said then: “Odysseus
“Shalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
“Lose all companions.”  And then Anticlea came.
Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus,
In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer.
And he sailed, by Sirens and thence outward and away
And unto Circe.
              Venerandam,
In the Cretan’s phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite,
Cypri munimenta sortita est, mirthful, orichalchi, with golden
Girdles and breast bands, thou with dark eyelids
Bearing the golden bough of Argicida. So that:"
2041,Canto III,Ezra Pound,"I sat on the Dogana’s steps
For the gondolas cost too much, that year,
And there were not “those girls”, there was one face,
And the Buccentoro twenty yards off, howling, “Stretti”,
And the lit cross-beams, that year, in the Morosini,
And peacocks in Koré’s house, or there may have been.
              Gods float in the azure air,
Bright gods and Tuscan, back before dew was shed.
Light: and the first light, before ever dew was fallen.
Panisks, and from the oak, dryas,
And from the apple, mælid,
Through all the wood, and the leaves are full of voices,
A-whisper, and the clouds bowe over the lake,
And there are gods upon them,
And in the water, the almond-white swimmers,
The silvery water glazes the upturned nipple,
                As Poggio has remarked.
Green veins in the turquoise,
Or, the gray steps lead up under the cedars.
 
My Cid rode up to Burgos,
Up to the studded gate between two towers,
Beat with his lance butt, and the child came out,
Una niña de nueve años,
To the little gallery over the gate, between the towers,
Reading the writ, voce tinnula:
That no man speak to, feed, help Ruy Diaz,
On pain to have his heart out, set on a pike spike
And both his eyes torn out, and all his goods sequestered,
“And here, Myo Cid, are the seals,
The big seal and the writing.”
And he came down from Bivar, Myo Cid,
With no hawks left there on their perches,
And no clothes there in the presses,
And left his trunk with Raquel and Vidas,
That big box of sand, with the pawn-brokers,
To get pay for his menie;
Breaking his way to Valencia.
Ignez de Castro murdered, and a wall
Here stripped, here made to stand.
Drear waste, the pigment flakes from the stone,
Or plaster flakes, Mantegna painted the wall.
Silk tatters, “Nec Spe Nec Metu.”"
2042,Canto IV,Ezra Pound,"Palace in smoky light,
Troy but a heap of smouldering boundary stones,
ANAXIFORMINGES!  Aurunculeia!
Hear me.   Cadmus of Golden Prows!
The silver mirrors catch the bright stones and flare,
Dawn, to our waking, drifts in the green cool light;
Dew-haze blurs, in the grass, pale ankles moving.
Beat, beat, whirr, thud, in the soft turf
                under the apple trees,
Choros nympharum, goat-foot, with the pale foot alternate;
Crescent of blue-shot waters, green-gold in the shallows,
A black cock crows in the sea-foam;
 
And by the curved, carved foot of the couch,
             claw-foot and lion head, an old man seated
Speaking in the low drone…:
                        Ityn!
Et ter flebiliter, Ityn, Ityn!
And she went toward the window and cast her down,
               “All the while, the while, swallows crying:
Ityn!
               “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish.”
               “It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish?”
               “No other taste shall change this.”
And she went toward the window,
                      the slim white stone bar
Making a double arch;
Firm even fingers held to the firm pale stone;
Swung for a moment,
                        and the wind out of Rhodez
Caught in the full of her sleeve.
               . . .  the swallows crying:
‘Tis.  ‘Tis.  ‘Ytis!
               Actæon…
                   and a valley,
The valley is thick with leaves, with leaves, the trees,
The sunlight glitters, glitters a-top,
Like a fish-scale roof,
               Like the church roof in Poictiers
If it were gold.
               Beneath it, beneath it
Not a ray, not a slivver, not a spare disc of sunlight
Flaking the black, soft water;
Bathing the body of nymphs, of nymphs, and Diana,
Nymphs, white-gathered about her, and the air, air,
Shaking, air alight with the goddess
               fanning their hair in the dark,
Lifting, lifting and waffing:
Ivory dipping in silver,
               Shadow’d, o’ershadow’d
Ivory dipping in silver,
Not a splotch, not a lost shatter of sunlight.
Then Actæon: Vidal,
Vidal.   It is old Vidal speaking,
    stumbling along in the wood,
Not a patch, not a lost shimmer of sunlight,
                the pale hair of the goddess.
 
The dogs leap on Actæon,
                “Hither, hither, Actæon,”
Spotted stag of the wood;
Gold, gold, a sheaf of hair,
                Thick like a wheat swath,
Blaze, blaze in the sun,
                The dogs leap on Actæon.
Stumbling, stumbling along in the wood,
Muttering, muttering Ovid:
                “Pergusa… pool… pool… Gargaphia,
“Pool… pool of Salmacis.”
                The empty armour shakes as the cygnet moves.
 
Thus the light rains, thus pours, e lo soleills plovil
The liquid and rushing crystal
                beneath the knees of the gods.
Ply over ply, thin glitter of water;
Brook film bearing white petals.
The pine at Takasago
                grows with the pine of Isé!
The water whirls up the bright pale sand in the spring’s mouth
“Behold the Tree of the Visages!”
Forked branch-tips, flaming as if with lotus.
                Ply over ply
The shallow eddying fluid,
                beneath the knees of the gods.
 
Torches melt in the glare
                set flame of the corner cook-stall,
Blue agate casing the sky (as at Gourdon that time)
                the sputter of resin,
Saffron sandal so petals the narrow foot: Hymenæus Io!
                Hymen, Io Hymenæe! Aurunculeia!
One scarlet flower is cast on the blanch-white stone.
 
                And So-Gyoku, saying:
“This wind, sire, is the king’s wind,
                This wind is wind of the palace,
Shaking imperial water-jets.”
                And Hsiang, opening his collar:
“This wind roars in the earth’s bag,
                it lays the water with rushes.”
No wind is the king’s wind.
                Let every cow keep her calf.
“This wind is held in gauze curtains…”
                       No wind is the king’s…
 
The camel drivers sit in the turn of the stairs,
                Look down on Ecbatan of plotted streets,
“Danaë! Danaë!
             What wind is the king’s?”
Smoke hangs on the stream,
The peach-trees shed bright leaves in the water,
Sound drifts in the evening haze,
                The bark scrapes at the ford,
Gilt rafters above black water,
                Three steps in an open field,
Gray stone-posts leading…
 
Père Henri Jacques would speak with the Sennin, on Rokku,
Mount Rokku between the rock and the cedars,
Polhonac,
As Gyges on Thracian platter set the feast,
Cabestan, Tereus,
                It is Cabestan’s heart in the dish,
Vidal, or Ecbatan, upon the gilded tower in Ecbatan
Lay the god’s bride, lay ever, waiting the golden rain.
By Garonne.             “Saave!”
The Garonne is thick like paint,
Procession,—“Et sa’ave, sa’ave, sa’ave Regina!”—
Moves like a worm, in the crowd.
Adige, thin film of images,
Across the Adige, by Stefano, Madonna in hortulo,
As Cavalcanti had seen her.
                The Centaur’s heel plants in the earth loam.
And we sit here…
                there in the arena…"
2043,Canto LXXXI,Ezra Pound,"Zeus lies in Ceres’ bosom
Taishan is attended of loves
                        under Cythera, before sunrise
And he said: “Hay aquí mucho catolicismo—(sounded

(Kings will, I think, disappear)
This was Padre José Elizondo

And later Bowers wrote: “but such hatred,

and the London reds wouldn’t show up his friends
                        (i.e. friends of Franco

when she gave me a paper to write on
with a black border half an inch or more deep,

                        said John Adams

(To break the pentameter, that was the first heave)

Ere the season died a-cold
Borne upon a zephyr’s shoulder

                                Dolmetsch ever be thy guest,

To enforce   both the grave   and the acute?
Has he curved us the bowl of the lute?

And for 180 years almost nothing.
 
Ed ascoltando al leggier mormorio
        there came new subtlety of eyes into my tent,
whether of the spirit or hypostasis,
            but what the blindfold hides
or at carneval
                                  nor any pair showed anger
            Saw but the eyes and stance between the eyes,
colour, diastasis,
      careless or unaware it had not the
   whole tent’s room
nor was place for the full EidwV
interpass, penetrate
      casting but shade beyond the other lights
              sky’s clear
              night’s sea
              green of the mountain pool
              shone from the unmasked eyes in half-mask’s space.
What thou lovest well remains,
                                                  the rest is dross
What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee
What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage
Whose world, or mine or theirs
                                            or is it of none?
First came the seen, then thus the palpable
        Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell,
What thou lovest well is thy true heritage
What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee
 
The ant’s a centaur in his dragon world.
Pull down thy vanity, it is not man
Made courage, or made order, or made grace,
         Pull down thy vanity, I say pull down.
Learn of the green world what can be thy place
In scaled invention or true artistry,
Pull down thy vanity,
                                        Paquin pull down!
The green casque has outdone your elegance.
 
“Master thyself, then others shall thee beare”
       Pull down thy vanity
Thou art a beaten dog beneath the hail,
A swollen magpie in a fitful sun,
Half black half white
Nor knowst’ou wing from tail
Pull down thy vanity
                        How mean thy hates
Fostered in falsity,
                        Pull down thy vanity,
Rathe to destroy, niggard in charity,
Pull down thy vanity,
                       I say pull down.
 
But to have done instead of not doing
                     this is not vanity
To have, with decency, knocked
That a Blunt should open
               To have gathered from the air a live tradition
or from a fine old eye the unconquered flame
This is not vanity.
         Here error is all in the not done,
all in the diffidence that faltered  .  .  ."
2044,Canto XLV,Ezra Pound,"With Usura
  
With usura hath no man a house of good stone
each block cut smooth and well fitting
that design might cover their face,
with usura
hath no man a painted paradise on his church wall
 harpes et luz
or where virgin receiveth message
and halo projects from incision,
with usura
seeth no man Gonzaga his heirs and his concubines
no picture is made to endure nor to live with
but it is made to sell and sell quickly
with usura, sin against nature,
is thy bread ever more of stale rags
is thy bread dry as paper,
with no mountain wheat, no strong flour
with usura the line grows thick
with usura is no clear demarcation
and no man can find site for his dwelling.
Stonecutter is kept from his stone
weaver is kept from his loom
WITH USURA
wool comes not to market
sheep bringeth no gain with usura
Usura is a murrain, usura
blunteth the needle in the maid’s hand
and stoppeth the spinner’s cunning. Pietro Lombardo
came not by usura
Duccio came not by usura
nor Pier della Francesca; Zuan Bellin’ not by usura
nor was ‘La Calunnia’ painted.
Came not by usura Angelico; came not Ambrogio Praedis,
Came no church of cut stone signed: Adamo me fecit.
Not by usura St. Trophime
Not by usura Saint Hilaire,
Usura rusteth the chisel
It rusteth the craft and the craftsman
It gnaweth the thread in the loom
None learneth to weave gold in her pattern;
Azure hath a canker by usura; cramoisi is unbroidered
Emerald findeth no Memling
Usura slayeth the child in the womb
It stayeth the young man’s courting
It hath brought palsey to bed, lyeth
between the young bride and her bridegroom
                               CONTRA NATURAM
They have brought whores for Eleusis
Corpses are set to banquet
at behest of usura.
 
 
 
N.B. Usury: A charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to production; often without regard to the possibilities of production. (Hence the failure of the Medici bank.)"
2045,Canto XVI,Ezra Pound,"And before hell mouth; dry plain
              and two mountains;
On the one mountain, a running form,
              and another
In the turn of the hill; in hard steel
The road like a slow screw’s thread,
The angle almost imperceptible,
               so that the circuit seemed hardly to rise;
And the running form, naked, Blake,
Shouting, whirling his arms, the swift limbs,
Howling against the evil,
               his eyes rolling,
Whirling like flaming cart-wheels,
               and his head held backward to gaze on the evil
As he ran from it,
                to be hid by the steel mountain,
And when he showed again from the north side;
                his eyes blazing toward hell mouth,
His neck forward,
                and like him Peire Cardinal.
And in the west mountain, Il Fiorentino,
Seeing hell in his mirror,
                 and lo Sordels
Looking on it in his shield;
And Augustine, gazing toward the invisible.
 
And past them, the criminal
                lying in the blue lakes of acid,
The road between the two hills, upward
                slowly,
The flames patterned in lacquer, crimen est actio,
The limbo of chopped ice and saw-dust,
And I bathed myself with acid to free myself
               of the hell ticks,
Scales, fallen louse eggs.
               Palux Laerna,
the lake of bodies, aqua morta,
of limbs fluid, and mingled, like fish heaped in a bin,
and here an arm upward, clutching a fragment of marble,
And the embryos, in flux,
              new inflow, submerging,
Here an arm upward, trout, submerged by the eels;
              and from the bank, the stiff herbage
the dry nobbled path, saw many known, and unknown,
for an instant;
               submerging,
The face gone, generation.
 
               Then light, air, under saplings,
the blue banded lake under æther,
               an oasis, the stones, the calm field,
the grass quiet,
               and passing the tree of the bough
The grey stone posts,
               and the stair of gray stone,
the passage clean-squared in granite:
               descending,
and I through this, and into the earth,
               patet terra,
entered the quiet air
               the new sky,
the light as after a sun-set,
               and by their fountains, the heroes,
Sigismundo, and Malatesta Novello,
               and founders, gazing at the mounts of their cities.
 
The plain, distance, and in fount-pools
               the nymphs of that water
rising, spreading their garlands,
               weaving their water reeds with the boughs,
In the quiet,
               and now one man rose from his fountain
and went off into the plain.
 
Prone in that grass, in sleep;
               et j’entendis des voix:…
                                                           wall .  .  .  Strasbourg
Galliffet led that triple charge.  .  .  Prussians
and he said                                                            [Plarr’s narration]
                          it was for the honour of the army.
And they called him a swashbuckler.
               I didn’t know what it was
But I thought:    This is pretty bloody damn fine.
And my old nurse, he was a man nurse, and
He killed a Prussian and he lay in the street
there in front of our house for three days
And he stank.  .  .  .  .  .  .
               Brother Percy,
And our Brother Percy…
               old Admiral
He was a middy in those days,
And they came into Ragusa
.  .  .  .  .  .  place those men went for the Silk War.  .  .  .  .
And they saw a procession coming down through
A cut in the hills, carrying something
The six chaps in front carrying a long thing
               on their shoulders,
And they thought it was a funeral,
               but the thing was wrapped up in scarlet,
And he put off in the cutter,
               he was a middy in those days,
To see what the natives were doing,
And they got up to the six fellows in livery,
And they looked at it, and I can still hear the old admiral,
“Was it? it was
               Lord Byron
Dead drunk, with the face of an A  y  n.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
He pulled it out long, like that:
                the face of an a  y  n  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  gel.”
 
And because that son of a bitch,
               Franz Josef of Austria.  .  .  .  .  .
And because that son of a bitch Napoléon Barbiche…
They put Aldington on Hill 70, in a trench
               dug through corpses
With a lot of kids of sixteen,
Howling and crying for their mamas,
And he sent a chit back to his major:
               I can hold out for ten minutes
With my sergeant and a machine-gun.
               And they rebuked him for levity.
And Henri Gaudier went to it,
               and they killed him,
And killed a good deal of sculpture,
And ole T.E.H. he went to it,
With a lot of books from the library,
London Library, and a shell buried ‘em in a dug-out,
And the Library expressed its annoyance.
               And a bullet hit him on the elbow
…gone through the fellow in front of him,
And he read Kant in the Hospital, in Wimbledon,
in the original,
And the hospital staff didn’t like it.
 
And Wyndham Lewis went to it,
With a heavy bit of artillery,
               and the airmen came by with a mitrailleuse,
And cleaned out most of his company,
               and a shell lit on his tin hut,
While he was out in the privy,
               and he was all there was left of that outfit.
 
Windeler went to it,
   and he was out in the Ægæan,
And down in the hold of his ship
               pumping  gas into a sausage,
And the boatswain looked over the rail,
               down into amidships, and he said:
               Gees! look a’ the Kept’n,
The Kept’n’s a-gettin’ ‘er up.
 
And Ole Captain Baker went to it,
                with his legs full of rheumatics,
So much so he couldn’t run,
                 so he was six months in hospital,
Observing the mentality of the patients.
 
And Fletcher was 19 when he went to it,
And his major went mad in the control pit,
        about  midnight, and started throwing the ‘phone about
And he had to keep him quiet
               till abut six in the morning,
And direct that bunch of artillery.
 
And Ernie Hemingway went to it,
               too much in a hurry,
And they buried him for four days.
 
Et ma foi, vous savez,
               tous les nerveux.  Non,
Y a une limite; les bêtes, les bêtes ne sont
Pas faites pour ça, c’est peu de chose un cheval.
Les hommes de 34 ans à quatre pattes
               qui criaient “maman.” Mais les costauds,
La fin, là à Verdun, n’y avait que ces gros bonshommes
               Et y voyaient extrêmement clair.
Qu’est-ce que ça vaut, les généraux, le lieutenant,
on les pèse à un centigramme,
               n’y a rien que du bois,
Notr’ capitaine, tout, tout ce qu’il y a de plus renfermé
               de vieux polytechnicien, mais solide,
La tête solide. Là, vous savez,
Tout, tout fonctionne, et les voleurs, tous les vices,
Mais les rapaces,
               y avait trois dans notre compagnie, tous tués.
Y sortaient fouiller un cadavre, pour rien,
               y n’serainet sortis pour rien que ça.
Et les boches, tout ce que vous voulez,
               militarisme, et cætera, et cætera.
Tout ça, mais, MAIS,
               l’français, i s’bat quand y a mangé.
Mais ces pauvres types
A  la  fin y s’attaquaient pour manger,
               Sans orders, les bêtes sauvages, on y fait
Prisonniers; ceux qui parlaient français disaient:
               “Poo quah? Ma foi on attaquait pour manger.”
 
C’est le corr-ggras, le corps gras,
               leurs trains marchaient trois kilomètres à l’heure,
Et ça criait, ça grincait, on l’entendait à cinq kilomètres.

I vous dit, bè, voui, tout sentait le pétrole.
Mais, Non! je l’ai engueulé.
Je lui ai dit: T’es un con! T’a raté la guerre.
 
O voui! tous les homes de goût, y conviens,
Tout ça en arrière.
               Mais un mec comme toi!
C’t homme, un type comme ça!
               Ce qu’il aurait pu encaisser!
Il était dans une fabrique.
What, burying squad, terrassiers, avec leur tête
               en arrière, qui regardaient comme ça,
On risquait la vie pour un coup de pelle,
Faut que ça soit bein carré, exact…
 
Dey vus a bolcheviki dere, und dey dease him:
Looka vat youah Trotzsk is done, e iss

That’s the trick with a crowd,
               Get ‘em into the street and get ‘em moving.
And all the time, there were people going
Down there, over the river.
           
               There was a man there talking,
To a thousand, just a short speech, and
Then move ‘em on.   And he said:
Yes, these people, they are all right, they
Can do everything, everything except act;
And go an’ hear ‘em but when they are through
Come to the bolsheviki…
 
And when it broke, there was the crowd there,
And the cossacks, just as always before,
But one thing, the cossacks said:
               “Pojalouista.”
And that got round in the crowd,
And then a lieutenant of infantry
Ordered ‘em to fire into the crowd,
               in the square at the end of the Nevsky,
In front of the Moscow station,
And they wouldn’t,
And he pulled his sword on a student for laughing,
And killed him,
And a cossack rode out of his squad
On the other side of the square
And cut down the lieutenant of infantry
And there was the revolution…
                as soon as they named it.
 
And you can’t make ‘em,
Nobody knew it was coming. They were all ready, the old gang,
Guns on the top of the post-office and the palace,
But none of the leaders knew it was coming.
 
And there were some killed at the barracks,
But that was between the troops.
 
So we used to hear it at the opera
That they wouldn’t be under Haig;
               and that the advance was beginning;
That it was going to begin in a week."
2046,Canto XXXVI,Ezra Pound,"A Lady asks me
               I speak in season
She seeks reason for an affect, wild often
That is so proud he hath Love for a name
Who denys it can hear the truth now
Wherefore I speak to the present knowers
Having no hope that low-hearted
              Can bring sight to such reason
Be there not natural demonstration
               I have no will to try proof-bringing
Or say where it hath birth
What is its virtu and power
Its being and every moving
Or delight whereby ‘tis called “to love”
Or if man can show it to sight.
 
Where memory liveth,
               it takes its state
Formed like a diafan from light on shade
Which shadow cometh of Mars and remaineth
Created, having a name sensate,
Custom of the soul,
               will from the heart;
Cometh from a seen form which being understood
Taketh locus and remaining in the intellect possible
Wherein hath he neither weight nor still-standing,
Descendeth not by quality but shineth out
Himself his own effect unendingly
Not in delight but in the being aware
Nor can he leave his true likeness otherwhere.
 
He is not vertu but cometh of that perfection
Which is so postulate not by the reason
But ‘tis felt, I say.
Beyond salvation, holdeth his judging force
Deeming intention to be reason’s peer and mate,
Poor in discernment, being thus weakness’ friend
Often his power cometh on death in the end,
Be it withstayed
                and so swinging counterweight.
Not that it were natural opposite, but only
Wry’d a bit from the perfect,
Let no man say love cometh from chance
Or hath not established lordship
Holding his power even though
               Memory hath him no more.
 
Cometh he to be
               when the will
From overplus
Twisteth out of natural measure,
Never adorned with rest Moveth he changing colour
Either to laugh or weep
Contorting the face with fear
               resteth but a little
Yet shall ye see of him That he is most often
With folk who deserve him
And his strange quality sets sighs to move
Willing man look into that forméd trace in his mind
And with such uneasiness as rouseth the flame.
Unskilled can not form his image,
He himself moveth not, drawing all to his stillness,
Neither turneth about to seek his delight
Nor yet to see out proving
Be it so great or so small.
 
He draweth likeness and hue from like nature
So making pleasure more certain in seeming
Nor can stand hid in such nearness,
Beautys be darts tho’ not savage
Skilled from such fear a man follows
Deserving spirit, that pierceth.
Nor is he known from his face
But taken in the white light that is allness
Toucheth his aim
Who heareth, seeth not form
But is led by its emanation
Being divided, set out from colour,
Disjunct in mid darkness
Grazeth the light, one moving by other,
Being divided, divided from all falsity
Worthy of trust
From him alone mercy proceedeth.
 
Go, song, surely thou mayest
Whither it please thee
For so art thou ornate that thy reasons
Shall be praised from thy understanders,
With others hast thou no will to make company.
 
“Called thrones, balascio or topaze”
Eriugina was not understood in his time
“which explains, perhaps, the delay in condemning him”
And they went looking for Manicheans
And found, so far as I can make out, no Manicheans
So they dug for, and damned Scotus Eriugina
“Authority comes from right reason,
                never the other way on”
Hence the delay in condemning him

2048,Contributions to a Rudimentary Concept of Nation,Omar Pérez,"On the volatile nights of a winter
nature corroborates with magnanimity
a Cuban is in training for amusement or amnesia,
so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
he brings candy to God, he cultivates the vernacular, he fights off
cirrhosis with fruit poached in syrup, he conducts business;
thus research has shown that The Cuban is resourceful.
In the weighty choreographies of a summer
nature authorizes already with suspicion
a Cuban meets the ocean with offerings and harpoons,
so often and unfairly assumed as the same,
he finger-counts the casualties, he commits an infraction
he slides his hands into his pockets, he avows and commits;
thus analysis has shown that The Cuban is inspired.
Let’s attend the improbable territory
where with pasty mouths a Cuban and The Cuban engage in virile
conversation
we will learn there by what voyage, by what strange condition
by what exchange
we fall prey to so much ingenuity."

A blown husk that is finished

And of man seeking good,

2050,Love Song,William Carlos Williams,"I lie here thinking of you:—
  
 the stain of love 
 is upon the world!
 Yellow, yellow, yellow
 it eats into the leaves,
 smears with saffron
 the horned branches that lean
 heavily
 against a smooth purple sky!
 There is no light
 only a honey-thick stain
 that drips from leaf to leaf
 and limb to limb
 spoiling the colors
 of the whole world—
  
 you far off there under
 the wine-red selvage of the west!"

2052,The Progression,Omar Pérez,"When one isn’t enough, you need two
when two aren’t enough, you need four
with four the progression begins, moving toward a number
that schoolteachers will call absurd.
Question: How many men do you need
to put up a house?
Answer: You need absurd men
when one isn’t enough and two can’t do
the work of One.
And how much money should we give these men
to compensate them?
You need absurd coins when one coin
sliced in half and handed out
isn’t enough.
And how many words do you need to
       transform them?
Absurd and absurd and absurd words
when silence isn’t enough.
This is what they call progression:
Absurd men aren’t enough for putting up the house,
absurd coins don’t make them happy
absurd words can’t dissuade them."

8 a.m. 

--Mom is wearing a Kailua Surfriders Staff teeshirt this morning. That must be Bryant’s old shirt. No, she insists, it’s an Iowa teeshirt. The young man down the street, the one she’s never met, gave her an Iowa teeshirt when he heard she’d gone to Iowa. It’s Iowa.

--I didn’t know she was coming today.

--She was sweet at 4 a.m., Bryant says. They had the first conversation about the shirt then.

--Israel sends more ground troops into Lebanon. There’s an opportunity there, we read in the Washington Post.

--I don’t like you. I don’t like them. I don’t like them either. And Susan? She laughs.

--Compare and contrast the acquisition of a language to its loss. Avoid the trap of merely saying that the latter happens in reverse order of the former. You are likely to do better if you see them as similar processes, though one leads to gain, the other loss. Think chemistry. Think performance of a script. Think Harold and the Purple Crayon. Think Harold Pinter.

--Think two old men fishing for a beautiful young woman in a lake. Think one of them might get “lucky.”

--When are you leaving? Where are you going? Are you taking the kids?

--Sangha and May hatch plots of their own. Go quiet when I arrive. In this life, you either make plots or have them hatched around you. Like eggs. Like poisoned ones.

2054,To the New Year,W. S. Merwin,"With what stillness at last
you appear in the valley
your first sunlight reaching down
to touch the tips of a few
high leaves that do not stir
as though they had not noticed
and did not know you at all
then the voice of a dove calls
from far away in itself
to the hush of the morning

so this is the sound of you
here and now whether or not
anyone hears it this is
where we have come with our age
our knowledge such as it is
and our hopes such as they are
invisible before us
untouched and still possible"
2055,As the Dead Prey Upon Us,Charles Olson,"As the dead prey upon us,
they are the dead in ourselves,
awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,
disentangle the nets of being!
 
I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.
I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.
But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires
were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together
 
as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered
about my mother, some of them taking care to pass
beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record
playing on the victrola, and all of them
desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell
 
I turned to the young man on my right and asked, “How is it,
there?” And he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor
poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations
of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard
displays, the dead roaming from one to another
as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed
to mere equipments
 
                               my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep
when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker
under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had
 
I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her
the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death
as other like suited and dressed people did in life
 
O the dead!
 
                    and the Indian woman and I
                    enabled the blue deer
                    to walk
 
                    and the blue deer talked,
                    in the next room,
                    a Negro talk
 
                    it was like walking a jackass,
                    and its talk
                    was the pressing gabber of gammers
                    of old women
 
                    and we helped walk it around the room
                    because it was seeking socks
                    or shoes for its hooves
                    now that it was acquiring
 
                    human possibilities
 
In the five hindrances men and angels
stay caught in the net, in the immense nets
which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets
which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels
and the demons
and men
go up and down
 
                                 Walk the jackass
                                 Hear the victrola
                                 Let the automobile
                                 be tucked into a corner of the white fence
                                 when it is a white chair. Purity
 
is only an instant of being, the trammels

recur
 
In the five hindrances, perfection
is hidden
                                 I shall get
                                 to the place
                                 10 minutes late.
 
                                 It will be 20 minutes
                                 of 9. And I don’t know,
 
                                 without the car,
 
                                 how I shall get there
 
O peace, my mother, I do not know
how differently I could have done
what I did or did not do.

                                 That you are back each week
                                 that you fall asleep
                                 with your face to the right
 
                                 that you are present there
                                 when I come in as you were
                                 when you were alive
 
                                 that you are as solid, and your flesh
                                 is as I knew it, that you have the company
                                 I am used to your having
 
                                 but o, that you all find it
                                 such a cheapness!
 
o peace, mother, for the mammothness
of the comings and goings
of the ladders of life
 
The nets we are entangled in. Awake,
my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle
of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires
be left upon the earth. Let even your mother
go. Let there be only paradise
 
The desperateness is, that the instant
which is also paradise (paradise
is happiness) dissolves
into the next instant, and power
flows to meet the next occurrence
 
                                 Is it any wonder
                                 my mother comes back?
                                 Do not that throng
                                 rightly seek the room
                                 where they might expect
                                 happiness? They did not complain
                                 of life, they obviously wanted
                                 the movie, each other, merely to pass
                                 among each other there,
                             where the real is, even to the display cards,
                             to be out of hell
 
                             The poverty
                             of hell

O souls, in life and in death,
make, even as you sleep, even in sleep
know what wind
even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile
lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,
equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,
the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘Viewbook,’
the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room
lifts the sodden nets
 
                                 and they disappear as ghosts do,
                                 as spider webs, nothing
                                 before the hand of man
 
                                 The vent! You must have the vent,
                                 or you shall die. Which means
                                 never to die, the ghastliness
 
                                 of going, and forever
                                 coming back, returning
                                 to the instants which were not lived
 
                                 O mother, this I could not have done,
                                 I could not have lived what you didn’t,
                                 I am myself netted in my own being
 
                                 I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,
                                 perfect
 
                                 O my soul, slip

The death in life (death itself)
is endless, eternity
is the false cause
 
The knot is other wise, each topological corner
presents itself, and no sword
cuts it, each knot is itself its fire
 
each knot of which the net is made
is for the hands to untake
the knot’s making. And touch alone
can turn the knot into its own flame
 
                          (o mother, if you had once touched me
 
                          o mother, if I had once touched you)
 
The car did not burn. Its underside
was not presented to me
a grotesque corpse. The old man
 
merely removed it as I looked up at it,
and put it in a corner of the picket fence
like was it my mother’s white dog?
 
or a child’s chair
 
                                 The woman,
                                 playing on the grass,
                                 with her son (the woman next door)
 
                                 was angry with me whatever it was
                                 slipped across the playpen or whatever
                                 she had out there on the grass
 
                                 And I was quite flip in reply
                                 that anyone who used plastic
                                 had to expect things to skid
 
                                 and break, that I couldn’t worry
                                 that her son might have been hurt
                                 by whatever it was I sent skidding
 
                                 down on them.
 
                                 It was just then I went into my house
                                 and to my utter astonishment
                                 found my mother sitting there
 
                                 as she always had sat, as must she always
                                 forever sit there her head lolling
                                 into sleep? Awake, awake my mother
 
                                 what wind will lift you too
                                 forever from the tawdriness,
                                 make you rich as all those souls
 
                                 crave crave crave
 
                                 to be rich?
 
They are right. We must have
what we want. We cannot afford
not to. We have only one course:
 
the nets which entangle us are flames
 
                                         O souls, burn
                                         alive, burn now
 
                                         that you may forever
                                         have peace, have
 
                                         what you crave
 
                                         O souls,
                                         go into everything,
                                         let not one knot pass
                                         through your fingers
 
                                         let not any they tell you
                                         you must sleep as the net
                                         comes through your authentic hands
 
                                         What passes
                                         is what is, what shall be, what has
                                         been, what hell and heaven is
                                         is earth to be rent, to shoot you
                                         through the screen of flame which each knot
                                         hides as all knots are a wall ready
                                         to be shot open by you
 
                                                                               the nets of being

                                         ought to be busy. Method, method
 
                                         I too call on you to come
                                         to the aid of all men, to women most
                                         who know most, to woman to tell
                                         men to awake. Awake, men,
                                         awake
 
I ask my mother
to sleep. I ask her
to stay in the chair.
My chair
is in the corner of the fence.
She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer
need not trouble either of us.
 
And if she sits in happiness the souls
who trouble her and me
will also rest. The automobile
 
has been hauled away."
2056,The Kingfishers,Charles Olson,"1
 
What does not change / is the will to change
 
He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He
remembered only one thing, the birds, how
when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
the one they had hoped was a male
 
Otherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers & Angkor Vat.
He had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,
I do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
in some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, “The kingfishers!
who cares
for their feathers
now?”
 
His last words had been, “The pool is slime.” Suddenly everyone,
ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
“The pool    the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth    why
did the export stop?”
 
It was then he left

I thought of the E on the stone, and of what Mao said
la lumiere”
                    but the kingfisher
de l’aurore”
                    but the kingfisher flew west
est devant nous!
                    he got the color of his breast
                    from the heat of the setting sun!
 
The features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
where the color is, short and round, the tail
inconspicuous.
 
But not these things were the factors. Not the birds.
The legends are
legends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
will not indicate a favoring wind,
or avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,
still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
It is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
It nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,
six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.
 
                                                   On these rejectamenta
(as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
And, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes
                                                              a dripping, fetid mass
 
Mao concluded:
                   nous devons
                                       nous lever
                                                         et agir!

When the attentions change / the jungle
leaps in
             even the stones are split
                                             they rive
 
Or,
enter
that other conqueror we more naturally recognize
he so resembles ourselves
 
But the E
cut so rudely on that oldest stone
sounded otherwise,
was differently heard
 
as, in another time, were treasures used:
 
(and, later, much later, a fine ear thought
a scarlet coat)
 
                       “of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes
                        of gold
 
                       “animals likewise,
                        resembling snails
 
                       “a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots,
                        and worked with tufts of leaves, weight
                        3800 ounces
 
                       “last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills
                        gold, the feet
                        gold, the two birds perched on two reeds
 
                        gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,
                        one yellow, the other
                        white.
 
                                     “And from each reed hung
                                      seven feathered tassels.
 
In this instance, the priests
(in dark cotton robes, and dirty,
their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly
over their shoulders)
rush in among the people, calling on them
to protect their gods
 
And all now is war
where so lately there was peace,
and the sweet brotherhood, the use
of tilled fields.

Not one death but many,
not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is
the law
 
                 Into the same river no man steps twice
                 When fire dies air dies
                 No one remains, nor is, one
 
Around an appearance, one common model, we grow up
many. Else how is it,
if we remain the same,
we take pleasure now
in what we did not take pleasure before? love
contrary objects? admire and / or find fault? use
other words, feel other passions, have
nor figure, appearance, disposition, tissue
the same?
         To be in different states without a change
         is not a possibility
 
We can be precise. The factors are
in the animal and / or the machine the factors are
communication and / or control, both involve
the message. And what is the message? The message is
a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time
 
is the birth of the air, is
the birth of water, is
a state between
the origin and
the end, between
birth and the beginning of
another fetid nest
 
is change, presents
no more than itself
 
And the too strong grasping of it,
when it is pressed together and condensed,
loses it
 
This very thing you are

                      this is also true: if I have any taste
                      it is only because I have interested myself

2057,The Librarian,Charles Olson,"The landscape (the landscape!) again: Gloucester,
the shore one of me is (duplicates), and from which
(from offshore, I, Maximus) am removed, observe.
 
In this night I moved on the territory with combinations
(new mixtures) of old and known personages: the leader,
my father, in an old guise, here selling books and manuscripts.
 
My thought was, as I looked in the window of his shop,
there should be materials here for Maximus, when, then,
I saw he was the young musician has been there (been before me)
 
before. It turned out it wasn’t a shop, it was a loft (wharf-
house) in which, as he walked me around, a year ago
came back (I had been there before, with my wife and son,
 
I didn’t remember, he presented me insinuations via
himself and his girl) both of whom I had known for years.
But never in Gloucester. I had moved them in, to my country.
 
His previous appearance had been in my parents’ bedroom where I
found him intimate with my former wife: this boy
was now the Librarian of Gloucester, Massachusetts!

I was struck by the fact I was in Gloucester, and that my daughter
was there—that I would see her! She was over the Cut. I
hadn’t even connected her with my being there, that she was
 
here. That she was there (in the Promised Land—the Cut!

were in the fish-house too, that the Librarian had made a party
 
I was to read. They were. There were many of them, slumped
around. It was not for me. I was outside. It was the Fort.
The Fort was in East Gloucester—old Gorton’s Wharf, where the Library
 
was. It was a region of coal houses, bins. In one a gang
was beating someone to death, in a corner of the labyrinth
of fences. I could see their arms and shoulders whacking
 
down. But not the victim. I got out of there. But cops

dogwood flakes
what is green
 
the petals
from the apple
blow on the road
 
mourning doves
mark the sway
of the afternoon, bees
dig the plum blossoms
 
the morning
stands up straight, the night
is blue from the full of the April moon
 
iris and lilac, birds
birds, yellow flowers
white flowers, the Diesel
does not let up dragging
the plow
 
               as the whippoorwill,
the night’s tractor, grinds
his song
 
 
              and no other birds but us
are as busy (O saisons, O chateaux!
Délires!
 
                What soul
is without fault?
 
Nobody studies
happiness
 
Every time the cock crows
I salute him
 
I have no longer any excuse
for envy. My life
 
has been given its orders: the seasons
seize
 
the soul and the body, and make mock
of any dispersed effort. The hour of death
 
is the only trespass
 
 
II. The Charge

the birds are so many they are
loud, in the afternoon
 
they distract, as so many bees do
suddenly all over the place
 
With spring one knows today to see
that in the morning each thing
 
is separate but by noon
they have melted into each other
 
and by night only crazy things
like the full moon and the whippoorwill
 
and us, are busy. We are busy
if we can get by that whiskered bird,
 
that nightjar, and get across, the moon
is our conversation, she will say
 
what soul
isn’t in default?
 
can you afford not to make
the magical study
 
which happiness is? do you hear
the cock when he crows? do you know the charge,
 
that you shall have no envy, that your life
has its orders, that the seasons
 
seize you too, that no body and soul are one
if they are not wrought
 
in this retort? that otherwise efforts
are efforts? And that the hour of your flight
 
will be the hour of your death?
 
 
III. Spring
 
The dogwood
lights up the day.
 
The April moon
flakes the night.
 
Birds, suddenly,
are a multitude
 
The flowers are ravined
by bees, the fruit blossoms
 
are thrown to the ground, the wind
the rain forces everything. Noise—
 
even the night is drummed
by whippoorwills, and we get
 
as busy, we plow, we move,
we break out, we love. The secret
 
which got lost neither hides
nor reveals itself, it shows forth
 
tokens. And we rush
to catch up. The body
 
whips the soul. In its great desire
it demands the elixir
 
In the roar of spring,
transmutations. Envy
 
drags herself off. The fault of the body and the soul
—that they are not one—
 
the matutinal cock clangs
and singleness: we salute you
 
season of no bungling"
2059,April Snow,Matthew Zapruder,"Today in El Paso all the planes are asleep on the runway. The world
is in a delay. All the political consultants drinking whiskey keep
their heads down, lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred
waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace. They jingle
when she brings them drinks. Outside the giant plate glass windows
the planes are completely covered in snow, it piles up on the wings.
I feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers. Each of the various
faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected. I don’t
want to talk on the phone to an angel. At night before I go to sleep
I am already dreaming. Of coffee, of ancient generals, of the faces
of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings.
I examine my feelings without feeling anything. I ride my blue bike
on the edge of the desert. I am president of this glass of water."
2060,Globus Hystericus,Timothy Donnelly,"1
 
A pity the selfsame vehicle that spirits me away from
factories of tedium should likewise serve to drag
me backwards into panic, or that panic should erect
 
massive factories of its own, their virulent pollutants
havocking loved waterways, frothing all the reed-
fringed margins acid pink and gathering in the shell
 
and soft tissues of the snails unknowingly in danger
as they inch up stems. Through the bulkhead door
I can hear their spirals plunk into the sluggish south-
 
bound current and dissolve therein with such brutal
regularity their dying has given rise to the custom
of measuring time here in a unit known as the snailsdeath.
 
The snailsdeath refers to the average length of time,
about 43 seconds, elapsing between the loss of the first
snail to toxic waters and the loss of the next, roughly
 
equivalent to the pause between swallows in a human
throat, while the adverb here refers to my person
and all its outskirts, beginning on the so-called cellular
 
level extending more of less undaunted all the way down
to the vale at the foot of the bed. I often fear I’ll wake
to find you waiting there and won’t know how to speak
 
on the subject of my production, or rather my woeful
lack thereof, but in your absence, once again, I will begin
drafting apologies in a language ineffectual as doves.

Daybreak on my marshland: a single egret, blotched,
trudges through the froth. I take its photograph
from the rooftop observation deck from which I watch
 
day’s delivery trucks advance. I take advantage of
the quiet before their arrival to organize my thoughts
on the paranormal thusly: (1) If the human psyche
 
has proven spirited enough to produce such a range
of material effects upon what we’ll call the closed
system of its custodial body, indeed if it’s expected to,
 
and (2) If such effects might be thought to constitute
the physical expression of that psyche, an emanation
willed into matter in a manner not unlike a brand-
 
new car or cream-filled cake or disposable camera,
and (3) If the system of the body can be swapped out
for another, maybe an abandoned factory or a vale,
 
then might it not also prove possible for the psyche
by aptitude or lather or sheer circumstance to impress
its thumbprint on some other system, a production
 
in the basement, or in a video store, as when I find you
inching up steps or down a shady aisle or pathway,
dragging your long chains behind you most morosely
 
if you ask me, the question is: Did you choose this, or was it
imposed on you, but even as I ask your hands move
wildly about your throat to indicate you cannot speak.
    
 
 
3
 
After the memory of the trucks withdrawing heavy
with their cargo fans out and fades into late-morning
hunger, I relocate in time to the lit bank of vending
 
machines still humming in the staff-room corner for a light
meal of cheese curls, orange soda, and what history
will come to mourn as the last two cream-filled cakes.
 
Eating in silence, a breeze in the half-light, absently
thinking of trying not to think, I imagine the Bethlehem
steel smokestacks above me piping nonstop, the sky
 
wide open without any question, steam and dioxides
of carbon and sulfur, hands pressed to the wall as I walk
down the corridor to stop myself from falling awake
 
again on the floor in embarrassment. If there’s any use
of imagination more productive or time less painful
it hasn’t tried hard enough to push through to find me
 
wandering the wings of a ghost-run factory as Earth
approaches the dark vale cut in the heart of the galaxy.
Taking shots of the sunbaked fields of putrefaction
 
visible from the observation deck. Hoping to capture
what I can point to as the way it feels. Sensing my hand
in what I push away. Watching it dissolve into plumes
 
rising like aerosols, or like ghosts of indigenous peoples,
or the lump in the throat to keep me from saying that
surviving almost everything has felt like having killed it.

(Plunk) Up from the floor with the sun to the sound of
dawn’s first sacrifice to the residues of commerce.
On autofog, on disbelief: rejuvenation in a boxer brief
 
crashed three miles wide in the waves off Madagascar,
cause of great flooding in the Bible and in Gilgamesh.
Massive sphere of rock and ice, of all events in history
 
(Plunk) thought to be the lethalmost. A snailsdeath
semiquavers from pang to ghost where the habit of ghosts
of inhabiting timepieces, of conniving their phantom
 
tendrils through parlor air and into the escapements
of some inoperative heirloom clock on a mantel shows
not the dead’s ongoing interest in their old adversary
 
(Plunk) time so much as an urge to return to the hard
mechanical kind of being. An erotic lounging to reanimate
the long-inert pendulum. As I have felt you banging
 
nights in my machine, jostling the salt from a pretzel.
This passion for the material realm after death however
refuses to be reconciled with a willingness to destroy
 
(Plunk) it while alive. When the last of the human voices
told me what I had to do, they rattled off a shopping
list of artifacts they wanted thrown down open throats.
 
That left me feeling in on it, chosen, a real fun-time guy
albeit somewhat sleep-deprived; detail-oriented, modern,
yes, but also dubious, maudlin, bedridden, speechless.

Graffiti on the stonework around the service entrance
makes the doorway at night look like the mystagogic
mouth of a big beast, amphibious, outfitted with fangs,
 
snout, the suggestion of a tongue, throat, and alimentary
canal leading to a complex of caves, tunnels, temples . . .
There are rooms I won’t enter, at whose threshold I say
 
this is as far as I go, no farther, almost as if I can sense
there’s something in there I don’t want to see, or for which
to see means having wanted already to forget, unless
 
stepping into the mouth at last, pressed into its damp,
the advantage of not knowing is swapped out for the loss
of apartness from what you’d held unknown, meaning
 
you don’t come to know it so much as become it, wholly
warping into its absorbent fold. I can’t let that happen
if it hasn’t already. What draws me on might be thought
 
canine, keen-sighted, but it’s still incapable of divining why
the constant hum around or inside me has to choose
among being a nocturne of toxic manufacture, the call
 
of what remains of the jungle, or else just another prank
on my gullible anatomy. Am I not beset in the utmost
basement of industry? Is that basement itself not beset
 
by the broad, black-green, waxy leaves of Mesoamerica?
And haven’t I parted those selfsame leaves, discovering me
asleep on my own weapon, threat to no one but myself?
 
 
 
6
 
Asked again what I miss the most about my former life,
I remember to pause this time, look left, a little off-camera
an entire snailsdeath, an air of sifting the possibilities,
 
I eliminate certain objects and events from the running
right off the bat, such as when their great displeasure
brought the gods to turn to darkness all that had been
 
light, submerging mountaintops in stormwater, the gods
shocked by their own power, and heartsick to watch
their once dear people stippling the surf like little fishes.
 
Or when the flaming peccary of a comet struck the earth
with much the same effect, waves as high as ziggurats
crashing mathematically against our coastlines, scalding
 
plumes of vapor and aerosols tossed into the atmosphere
spawning storms to pummel the far side of the earth,
approximately 80 percent of all life vanished in a week.
 
Or when we squandered that very earth and shat on it
with much the same effect, and more or less on purpose,
emitting nonstop gases in the flow of our production,
 
shoveling it in as ancient icecaps melted, what difference
could another make now. And so I clear my throat, look
directly into the camera, and even though it will make me
 
come off bovine in their eyes, I say that what I miss the most
has to be those cream-filled cakes I used to like, but then
they prod me with their volts and lead me back to the barn.

After the panic grew more of less customary, the pity
dissolved into a mobile fogbank, dense, reducing visibility
from the rooftop observation deck. Mobile in the sense
 
that it possessed mobility, not in the sense that it actually
moved. Because it didn’t. It just stayed there, reducing
visibility but not in the sense that it simply diminished it
 
or diminished it partly. Because it didn’t. It pretty much
managed to do away with it altogether, as my photography
will come to show: field after field of untouched white.
 
After the possibility of change grew funny, threadbare,
too embarrassing to be with, I eased into the knowledge
that you’d never appear at the foot of the bed, the vale
 
turned into a lifetime’s heap of laundry, and not the gentle
tuffets and streambanks of an afterlife it seems we only
imagined remembering, that watercolor done in greens
 
and about which I predicted its monotony of fair weather
over time might deaden one all over again, unless being
changed with death means not only changing past change
 
but past even the wish for it. I worried to aspire towards
that condition might actually dull one’s aptitude for change.
That I would grow to protect what I wished to keep from
 
change at the cost of perpetuating much that required it.
In this sense I had come to resemble the fogbank, at once
given to motion but no less motionless than its photograph.
 
The last time I saw myself alive, I drew the curtain back
from the bed, stood by my sleeping body. I felt tenderness
towards it. I knew how long it had waited, and how little
 
time remained for it to prepare its bundle of grave-goods.
When I tried to speak, rather than my voice, my mouth
released the tight, distinctive shriek of an aerophone of clay.
 
I wanted to stop the shock of that from taking away from
what I felt. I couldn’t quite manage it. Even at this late hour,
even here, the purity of a feeling is ruined by the world.
    

8
 
The noises from the basement were not auspicious noises.
I wanted to live forever. I wanted to live forever and die
right then and there. I had heard the tight, distinctive shriek.
 
Here again and now. I no longer have legs. I am sleeping.
Long tendrils of tobacco smoke, composed of carbon dioxide,
water vapor, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen cyanide,
 
and 4,000 other chemical compounds, penetrate the room
through the gap beneath the door and through heating vents
with confidence. They are the spectral forms of anaconda.
 
The ruler of the underworld smokes cigars. A certain brand.
Hand-rolled. He smiles as if there is much to smile about.
And there is. He is hollow-eyed, toothless. His hat, infamous:
 
broad-brimmed, embellished with feathers, a live macaw.
His cape is depicted, often, as a length of fabric in distinctive
black and white chevrons. Otherwise, as here, the full pelt
 
of a jaguar. On a barge of plywood and empty milk cartons
he trudges through the froth. He is the lord of black sorcery
and lord of percussion. He is patron of commerce. He parts
 
the leaves of Mesoamerica, traveling with a retinue of drunken
ax wielders, collection agents. His scribe is a white rabbit.
Daughter of moon and of night. Elsewhere, you are having
 
your teeth taken out. There is no music left, but I still feel held
captive by the cinema, and in its custom, I believe myself
capable of protecting myself by hiding my face in my hands."
2061,Abd el-Hadi Fights a Superpower,Taha Muhammad Ali,"In his life
he neither wrote nor read.
In his life he
didn’t cut down a single tree,
didn’t slit the throat
of a single calf.
In his life he did not speak
of the New York Times
behind its back,
didn’t raise
his voice to a soul
except in his saying:
“Come in, please,
by God, you can’t refuse.”
 
               —
 
Nevertheless—
his case is hopeless,
his situation
desperate.
His God-given rights are a grain of salt
tossed into the sea.
 
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:

my client knows not a thing.
And I can assure you,
were he to encounter
the entire crew
of the aircraft carrier Enterprise,
he’d serve them eggs
sunny-side up,
and labneh
fresh from the bag."
2062,"As I Cross the Heliopause at Midnight, I Think of My Mission",Matthew Zapruder,"Drunker than Voyager I
but not as Voyager 2 I rode my blue
bike back through the darkness
to my lonely geode cave of light
awaiting nothing under the punctured
dome. I had achieved escape
velocity drinking clear liquid starlight
at the Thunderbird with a fingerless
Russian hedge fund inspector and one
who called himself The Champ. All
night I felt fine crystals cutting
my lips like rising up through
a hailstorm. And the great vacuum
cleaner that cannot be filled moved
through my chest, gathering
conversation dust and discharging
it through my borehole. During
one of many silences The Champ
took off his face and thus were many
gears to much metallic laughter
revealed. Long ago I forgot
the word which used to mean in truth
but now expresses disbelief. So
quickly did my future come. You who
are floating past me on your inward way,
please inform those glowing faces
who first gave me this shove I have
managed to rotate my brilliant
golden array despite their instructions."
2063,The Cloud Corporation,Timothy Donnelly,"1
 
The clouds part revealing a mythology of clouds
assembled in light of earliest birds, an originary
text over water over time, and that without which
 
the clouds part revealing an apology for clouds
implicit in the air where the clouds had been
recently witnessed rehearsing departure, a heartfelt phrase
 
in the push of the airborne drops and crystals
over water over time—how being made to think
oneself an obstruction between the observer
 
and the object or objects under surveillance or even
desired—or if I am felt to be beside the point
then I have wanted that, but to block a path is like
 
not being immaterial enough, or being too much
when all they want from you now is your station
cleared of its personal effects please and vanish—
 
not that they’d ever just come out and say it when
all that darting around of the eyes, all that shaky
camouflage of paper could only portend the beginning of the
 
end of your tenure at this organization, and remember
a capacity to draw meaning out of such seeming
accidence landed one here to begin with, didn’t it.
    
    
2
 
The clouds part revealing an anatomy of clouds
viewed from the midst of human speculation, a business
project undertaken in a bid to acquire and retain
 
control of the formation and movement of clouds.
As late afternoons I have witnessed the distant
towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun, in-box
 
empty, surround sound on, all my money made
in lieu of conversation—where conversation indicates
the presence of desire in the parties to embark on
 
exchange of spirit, hours forzando with heartfelt phrase—
made metaphor for it, the face on the clock tower
bright as a meteor, as if a torch were held against
 
likelihood to illuminate the time so I could watch
the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury
appointments of my office suite, the tumult below
 
or behind me out of mind, had not my whole attention
been riveted by the human figure stood upon
the tower’s topmost pinnacle, himself surveying
 
the clouds of the future parting in antiquity, a figure
not to be mistaken, tranquilly pacing a platform
with authority: the chief executive officer of clouds.
    

3
 
The clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds
built in glass-front factories carved into cliff-faces
which, prior to the factories’ recent construction,
 
provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons,
a species revered in ancient Egypt as attendants
of Thoth, god of wisdom, science, and measurement.
 
Fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts
can be heard from up to a mile away, depending on
air temperature, humidity, the absence or presence
 
of any competing sound, its origin and its character.
It is no more impossible to grasp the baboon’s
full significance in Egyptian religious symbolism
 
than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture
provoke in an audience more positive, lasting
response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature.
 
Even those who consider natural clouds products
of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely
human mind lie behind the products they admire.
 
This development may be a form of self-exalting
or else another adaptation in order that we find
the hum of machinery comforting through darkness.
    

4
 
The clouds part revealing there’s no place left to sit
myself down except for a single wingback chair
backed into a corner to face the window in which
 
the clouds part revealing the insouciance of clouds
cavorting over the backs of the people in the field
who cut the ripened barley, who gather it in sheaves,
 
who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails,
who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it,
who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently
 
palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off
the chaff as the grain falls to the floor, who collect
the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it
 
into flour, who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer
in the sanctuary, its walls washed white like milk.
To perform it repeatedly, to perform it each time
 
as if the first, to walk the dim corridor believing that
the conference it leads to might change everything,
to adhere to a possibility of reward, of betterment,
 
of moving above, with effort, the condition into which
one has been born, to whom do I owe the pleasure
of the hum to which I have been listening too long.

    
5
 
The clouds part revealing the advocates of clouds,
believers in people, ideas and things, the workers
of the united fields of clouds, supporters of the wars
 
to keep clouds safe, the devotees of heartfelt phrase
and belief you can change with water over time.
It is the habit of a settled population to give ear to
 
whatever is desirable will come to pass, a caressing
confidence—but one unfortunately not borne out
by human experience, for most things people desire
 
have been desired ardently for thousands of years
and observe—they are no closer to realization today
than in Ramses’ time. Nor is there cause to believe
 
they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow.
Attempts to speed them on have been undertaken
from the beginning; plans to force them overnight
 
are in copious, antagonistic operation today, and yet
they have thoroughly eluded us, and chances are
they will continue to elude us until the clouds part
 
in a flash of autonomous, ardent, local brainwork—
but when the clouds start to knit back together again,
we’ll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission.

    
6
 
The clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies
united into one immaterial body, a fictive person
around whom the air is blurred with money, force
 
from which much harm will come, to whom my welfare
matters nothing. I sense without turning the light
from their wings, their eyes; they preen themselves
 
on the fire escape, the windowsill, their pink feet
vulnerable—a mistake to think of them that way.
If I turn around, the room might not be full of wings
 
capable of acting, in many respects, as a single being,
which is to say that I myself may be the source of
what I sense, but am no less powerless to change it.
 
Always around me, on my body, in my mouth, I fear them
and their love of money, everything I do without
thinking to help them make it. And if I am felt to be
 
beside the point, I have wanted that, to live apart
from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep
itself alive, and yet not happily, with all its needs
 
and comforts met, but fattened so far past that point
I am engrossed, and if I picture myself outside of it
it isn’t me anymore, but a parasite cast out, inviable.
    
    
7
 
The clouds part revealing the distinction between
words without meaning and meaning without words,
a phenomenon of nature, the westbound field
 
of low air pressure developing over water over time
and warm, saturated air on the sea surface rising
steadily replaced by cold air from above, the cycle
 
repeating, the warm moving upward into massive
thunderclouds, the cold descending into the eye
around which bands of thunderclouds spiral, counter-
 
clockwise, often in the hundreds, the atmospheric
pressure dropping even further, making winds
accelerate, the clouds revolve, a confusion of energy,
 
an incomprehensible volume of rain—I remember
the trick of thinking through infinity, a crowd of eyes
against an asphalt wall, my vision of it scrolling
 
left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then
just black until I fall asleep and then just black again,
past marketing, past focus groups, past human
 
resources, past management, past personal effects,
their insignificance evident in the eye of the dream
and through much of the debriefing I wake into next."
2064,Erstwhile Harbinger Auspices,Matthew Zapruder,"Erstwhile means long time gone.
A harbinger is sent before to help,
and also a sign of things
to come. Like this blue
stapler I bought at Staples.
Did you know in ancient Rome
priests called augurs studied
the future by carefully watching
whether birds were flying
together or alone, making what
honking or beeping noises
in what directions? It was called
the auspices. The air
was thus a huge announcement.
Today it’s completely
transparent, a vase. Inside it
flowers flower. Thus
a little death scent. I have
no master but always wonder,
what is making my master sad?
Maybe I do not know him.
This morning I made extra coffee
for the beloved and covered
the cup with a saucer. Skeleton
I thought, and stay
very still, whatever it was
will soon pass by and be gone."
2065,Jerusalem,Naomi Shihab Nye,"“Let’s be the same wound if we must bleed.
         Let’s fight side by side, even if the enemy
         is ourselves: I am yours, you are mine.”
                        —Tommy Olofsson, Sweden

I’m not interested in
who suffered the most.
I’m interested in
people getting over it.

Once when my father was a boy
a stone hit him on the head.
Hair would never grow there.
Our fingers found the tender spot
and its riddle: the boy who has fallen
stands up. A bucket of pears
in his mother’s doorway welcomes him home.
The pears are not crying.
Later his friend who threw the stone
says he was aiming at a bird.
And my father starts growing wings.

Each carries a tender spot:
something our lives forgot to give us.
A man builds a house and says,
“I am native now.”
A woman speaks to a tree in place
of her son. And olives come.
A child’s poem says,
“I don’t like wars,
they end up with monuments.”
He’s painting a bird with wings
wide enough to cover two roofs at once.

Why are we so monumentally slow?
Soldiers stalk a pharmacy:
big guns, little pills.
If you tilt your head just slightly
it’s ridiculous.

There’s a place in my brain
where hate won’t grow.
I touch its riddle: wind, and seeds.
Something pokes us as we sleep.

It’s late but everything comes next."
2066,Meeting at an Airport,Taha Muhammad Ali,"You asked me once,
on our way back
from the midmorning
trip to the spring:
“What do you hate,
and who do you love?”
 
And I answered,
from behind the eyelashes
of my surprise,
my blood rushing
like the shadow
cast by a cloud of starlings:
“I hate departure . . .
I love the spring
and the path to the spring,
and I worship the middle
hours of morning.”
And you laughed . . .
and the almond tree blossomed
and the thicket grew loud with nightingales.
 
. . . A question
now four decades old:
I salute that question’s answer;
and an answer
as old as your departure;
I salute that answer’s question . . .
 
And today,
it’s preposterous,
here we are at a friendly airport
by the slimmest of chances,
and we meet.
Ah, Lord!
we meet.
And here you are
asking—again,
it’s absolutely preposterous—
I recognized you
but you didn’t recognize me.
“Is it you?!”
But you wouldn’t believe it.
And suddenly
you burst out and asked:
“If you’re really you,
What do you hate
and who do you love?!”
 
And I answered—
my blood
fleeing the hall,
rushing in me
like the shadow
cast by a cloud of starlings:
“I hate departure,
and I love the spring,
and the path to the spring,
and I worship the middle
hours of morning.”
 
And you wept,
and flowers bowed their heads,
and doves in the silk of their sorrow stumbled."
2067,The New Intelligence,Timothy Donnelly,"After knowledge extinguished the last of the beautiful
fires our worship had failed to prolong, we walked
back home through pedestrian daylight, to a residence
 
humbler than the one left behind. A door without mystery,
a room without theme. For the hour that we spend
complacent at the window overlooking the garden,
 
we observe an arrangement in rust and gray-green,
a vagueness at the center whose slow, persistent
movements some sentence might explain if we had time
 
or strength for sentences. To admit that what falls
falls solitarily, lost in the permanent dusk of the particular.
That the mind that fear and disenchantment fatten
 
comes to boss the world around it, morbid as the damp-
fingered guest who rearranges the cheeses the minute the host
turns to fix her a cocktail. A disease of the will, the way
 
false birch branches arch and interlace from which
hands dangle last leaf-parchments and a very large array
of primitive bird-shapes. Their pasted feathers shake
 
in the aftermath of the nothing we will ever be content
to leave the way we found it. I love that about you.
I love that when I call you on the long drab days practicality
 
keeps one of us away from the other that I am calling
a person so beautiful to me that she has seen my awkwardness
on the actual sidewalk but she still answers anyway.
 
I say that when I fell you fell beside me and the concrete
refused to apologize. That a sparrow sat for a spell
on the windowsill today to communicate the new intelligence.
 
That the goal of objectivity depends upon one’s faith
in the accuracy of one’s perceptions, which is to say
a confidence in the purity of the perceiving instrument.
 
I won’t be dying after all, not now, but will go on living dizzily
hereafter in reality, half-deaf to reality, in the room
perfumed by the fire that our inextinguishable will begins."
2068,Schwinn,Matthew Zapruder,"I hate the phrase “inner life.” My attic hurts,
and I’d like to quit the committee
for naming tornadoes. Do you remember
how easy and sad it was to be young
and defined by our bicycles? My first
was yellow, and though it was no Black
Phantom or Sting-Ray but merely a Varsity
I loved the afternoon it was suddenly gone,
chasing its apian flash through the neighborhoods
with my father in vain. Like being a nuclear
family in a television show totally unaffected
by a distant war. Then we returned
to the green living room to watch the No Names
hold our Over the Hill Gang under
the monotinted chromatic defeated Super
Bowl waters. 1973, year of the Black Fly
caught in my Jell-O. Year of the Suffrage Building
on K Street NW where a few minor law firms
mingle proudly with the Union of Butchers
and Meat Cutters. A black hand
already visits my father in sleep, moving
up his spine to touch his amygdala. I will
never know a single thing anyone feels,
just how they say it, which is why I am standing
here exactly, covered in shame and lightning,
doing what I’m supposed to do."
2069,To His Own Device,Timothy Donnelly,"That figure in the cellarage you hear upsetting boxes
is an antic of the mind, a baroque imp cobbled
up under bulbs whose flickering perplexes night’s
 
impecunious craftsman, making what he makes
turn out irregular, awry, every effort botched
in its own wrong way. You belong, I said, laid out chalk-
 
white between a layer of tautened cotton gauze
and another of the selfsame rubbish that you are
wreaking havoc on tonight—and it didn’t disagree.
 
What’s more, I said, you are amiss in this ad hoc quest
for origin and purpose. Whatever destiny it is
you are meant to aspire to before you retire to
 
that soup-bowl of oblivion such figments as we
expect to find final rest in couldn’t possibly be
contained in these boxes. And again—no contest.
 
And when I was in need, I said, you raveled off
in the long-winded ploys of a winless October,
unfaithful to the one whose instincts had devised you . . .
 
—At this, the figure dropped the box from its hands,
turned down a dock I remembered and wept.
I followed it down there, sat beside it and wept.
 
Looking out on the water in time we came to see
being itself had made things fall apart this way.
We envied the simplicity implicit in sea-sponges
 
and similar marine life, their resistance to changes
across millennia we took to be deliberate, an art
practiced untheatrically beneath the water’s surface.
 
We admired the example the whole sea set, actually.
Maritime pauses flew like gulls in our exchanges.
We wondered that much longer before we had left."
2070,Wildpeace,Yehuda Amichai,"Not the peace of a cease-fire,
not even the vision of the wolf and the lamb,
but rather
as in the heart when the excitement is over
and you can talk only about a great weariness.
I know that I know how to kill,
that makes me an adult.
And my son plays with a toy gun that knows
how to open and close its eyes and say Mama.
A peace
without the big noise of beating swords into ploughshares,
without words, without
the thud of the heavy rubber stamp: let it be
light, floating, like lazy white foam.
A little rest for the wounds—
who speaks of healing?
(And the howl of the orphans is passed from one generation
to the next, as in a relay race:
the baton never falls.)

Let it come
like wildflowers,
suddenly, because the field
must have it: wildpeace."
2071,The Thrift Shop Dresses,Frannie Lindsay,"I slid the white louvers shut so I could stand in your closet 
a little while among the throng of flowered dresses 
you hadn’t worn in years, and touch the creases 
on each of their sleeves that smelled of forgiveness
and even though you would still be alive a few more days 
I knew they were ready to let themselves be 
packed into liquor store boxes simply 
because you had asked that of them,
and dropped at the door of the Salvation Army 
without having noticed me 
wrapping my arms around so many at once 
that one slipped a big padded shoulder off of its hanger 
as if to return the embrace."
2072,Making a Fist,Naomi Shihab Nye,"We forget that we are all dead men conversing with dead men.
                                                                  —Jorge Luis Borges

For the first time, on the road north of Tampico,
I felt the life sliding out of me,
a drum in the desert, harder and harder to hear.
I was seven, I lay in the car
watching palm trees swirl a sickening pattern past the glass.
My stomach was a melon split wide inside my skin.

“How do you know if you are going to die?”
I begged my mother.
We had been traveling for days.
With strange confidence she answered,
“When you can no longer make a fist.”

Years later I smile to think of that journey,
the borders we must cross separately,
stamped with our unanswerable woes.
I who did not die, who am still living,
still lying in the backseat behind all my questions,
clenching and opening one small hand."
2073,"Monday, September 25, 2006",Susan M. Schultz,"--
The former President lost his temper. 
Loss of content in our public life. Only forms remain, intonation, affect. 
Why did you  yell in my mom’s house? 
Radhika asks our neighbor.


--
She sounded like she does when her hands shake. 
She does not want to be there. Bryant calls to ask about her things. A tape on osteoperosis. No. Foundations of Economics (from the 1930s). No. The Soviet shelf. No. The Nazi shelf. No. The Greeks, the Moslems. No. The speech and drama shelf. No. Encyclopedias, no. Check reigsters back to 1964. No. Harry Truman, no. Mrs. Ike, no.


--
Was her reading too intense?

--
Grief is excess of sound. Anger is excess of form. Sadness can lack, or still exceed. Excess is overtone, the note beyond the note you sound. Without the tone, there is no object.
 Did I kill Bin Laden? No. But I tried.


--My task is to inventory sentences, place them in order, box them up and ship them in a container. They are a sturdy furniture, haphazard art. They are boxes of papers, bills, pieces of a dissertation. A computer shopper magazine (discard). Titles whose aura was a life, or two, or three. The house is now full of light. A girl wanders through the rooms, trying keys at the windows. My mother knows none of this.


--My father might be in the garden, or the scarecrow that wears his hat. Let him wander the house this last, inspect the plumbing, lights, air conditioning, the rows of beans, sort through medals, papers, release them as excess.

2074,Calling the White Donkey,Ray Gonzalez,"I called the white donkey that hurt my left shoulder
the last time it appeared, ramming me
with its ivory head, cracking my back
to relieve me of worry and hope.
I called the white donkey,
surprised at the sound of my voice.
Scared, I wondered if the white head
would give me its donkey brain,
snowy matter dripping into my ears
like the horse of the first man who fell off,
the donkey teaching me about desire
and the moan, that white hair on the back
of my head that warns me.
 
I called the donkey.
It came slowly toward me,
huge ears shaking with fury,
its breath turning the air white
as it bit into the white apple
of my throat.
I faced the donkey, watched
its gait become a shuffle of possession,
shaking its head as it stopped to
root its dirty hoofs in the ground.
 
I stepped back and clicked my fingers,
but it would not come closer, its snort
commanding I listen as it farted.
I walked away and did not know it was
I who yearned for labor of the ass
because the animal I summoned
couldn’t remove the white scar from
my heart, a blind life I lived for good."
2075,For the Other World,Ray Gonzalez,"For those who ran in the streets,
there were no faces to welcome them back.
José escaped and loved the war.
 
For those who swam with bitterness
of a scorched love,
there was a rusted car to work on.
 
For those who merely passed
and reclined in prayer,
there was the tower and the cross.
 
For those who dedicated tongues
to the living and dying,
there were turquoise painted doorways.
 
For those who left their children
tied to the water heater,
there was a shout and a name.
 
For those whose world
was real and beautiful,
there was a cigarette and a saint.
 
For those who asked José
to stay and feed his children,
there were flowers at their funerals.
 
For those who carried a shovel
tattooed on their backs,
there was a wet towel and a bottle.
 
For those who swept the street
of superstition and lie,
there was the house to come home to.
 
For those who came home late
and put their swollen feet up,
there was love and the smell of dirty socks.
 
For those who feared the devil
and spit on his painted arms,
there was a lesson in rosaries.
 
For those who had to leave
before the sun went down,
there was asphalt and a bus.
 
For those who stared at wet plaster
and claimed the face of Christ appeared,
there was confinement and stale bread.
 
For those who talked with each other
and said it was time to go,
there was lead in the paint and on the tongue.
 
For those who left children behind,
there was a strange world
of sulphur and sparrow nests.
 
For those who accused their ancestors
of eating salt, there were these hands
tracing what was left after the sweat."
2076,Kick the Heart,Ray Gonzalez,"Kick in the heart.
Kick the starting lance.
Throw the ground a word and stand back.
The color of terror is the envy
on body rags, the dragonfly war
scraped off a painting inside the door.
 
Kick the shame.
Kick the falling dawn as fortunate.
Throw the corrupted guest out the door.
A sequence of rhythms bound for
the light on your bed.
On the eggplant cooked for the husband
working late: an ant, a hair—
the only thing said to race the mind.
Take someone else’s voice and touch their ears.
Make sure they hear you cry
in their own whispers, their harangue.
 
Kick the soil.
Kick the sweet drowning as if you know
the round jubilance of pear is afraid
of a darkening spoon, a honey of flavor,
the tender one who never touches your plate.
The tired one who rations food
to thank God eternity is here and there.
 
Slip the eye the blue-black stranger,
his instrument of scars and neglect,
its tune of every wish besides
the grave of a careless, quiet man.
Shape his sound into the thumb asking
for a ride in the years of not going anywhere.
 
Kick the alphabet.
Kick the hungry thigh and try again.
Reduce yourself to a moving mouth, a solemn happiness
that smells of the past, takes hold of the throat
and teaches you to despise omens—
ignore Apache mirrors on rock arches
as if you knew what their scratchings meant.
 
Kick the heart.
Kick the starting lance.
It moves deeper into the month of blinking neon
where vertigo is perfume, desire foaming
on your bare feet killed by frost,
taken by the animal waking inside your holy cross—
a figure of green gowns and things
that follows you until you dance.
 
Kick the truth.
Kick the belly until it confesses.
Admit you were fed by a woman
flapping in the wind, told to sit there by a father
who made her give birth to a shimmering head,
your brain of flowers blossoming upon
the body always first to confess.
 
What snow is left is tired water unmoved by your
seasonal words, your circle healing by slowing down,
swelling to the size of God,
yellow leaves in the blood nothing dangerous—
this impulse, this kick to the brittle lake
where the snow goes away."
2077,Yom Kippur 1984,Adrienne Rich,"I drew solitude over me, on the long shore.
                                        —Robinson Jeffers, “Prelude”  

          For whoever does not afflict his soul through this day, shall be
          cut off from his people.
                                                                           —Leviticus 23:29

What is a Jew in solitude?
What would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid
far from your own or those you have called your own?
What is a woman in solitude:   a queer woman or man?
In the empty street, on the empty beach, in the desert
what in this world as it is can solitude mean?
 
The glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs
with its electric gate, its perfected privacy
is not what I mean
the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in Utah or the Golan Heights
is not what I mean
the poet’s tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen
is not what I mean
 
Three thousand miles from what I once called home
I open a book searching for some lines I remember
about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once
bound me back there—yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside,
something that bloomed and faded and was written down
in the poet’s book, forever:
Opening the poet’s book
I find the hatred in the poet’s heart: . . . the hateful-eyed
 and human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them
 
Robinson Jeffers, multitude
is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys
and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines
are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey Pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf,
and the separate persons, stooped
over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest
who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams
Hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other
Must I argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend
a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist’s final solution, have I a choice?
 
To wander far from your own or those you have called your own
to hear strangeness calling you from far away
and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk
to go to meet the Stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind
(the Jew on the icy, rutted road on Christmas Eve prays for another Jew
the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:   Make those be a woman’s footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman’s god)
 
Find someone like yourself.   Find others.
Agree you will never desert each other.
Understand that any rift among you
means power to those who want to do you in.
Close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger.
But I have a nightmare to tell:   I am trying to say
that to be with my people is my dearest wish
but that I also love strangers
that I crave separateness
I hear myself stuttering these words
to my worst friends and my best enemies
who watch for my mistakes in grammar
my mistakes in love.
This is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me?
If a cloud knew loneliness and fear, I would be that cloud.
 
To love the Stranger, to love solitude—am I writing merely about privilege
about drifting from the center, drawn to edges,
a privilege we can’t afford in the world that is,
who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car
into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death
young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his Blackness
Jew deluded that she’s escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;   Jew who has turned her back
on midrash and mitzvah (yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone
found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as Jew?)
 
Solitude, O taboo, endangered species
on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, I want a gun to defend you
In the desert, on the deserted street, I want what I can’t have:
your elder sister, Justice, her great peasant’s hand outspread
her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true 
 
And I ask myself, have I thrown courage away?
have I traded off something I don’t name?
To what extreme will I go to meet the extremist?
What will I do to defend my want or anyone’s want to search for her spirit-vision
far from the protection of those she has called her own?
Will I find O solitude
your plumes, your breasts, your hair
against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird’s
singing Yes, you are loved, why else this song?
in the old places, anywhere?
 
What is a Jew in solitude?
What is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man?
When the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet’s headland, and the farms slide into the sea
when leviathan is endangered and Jonah becomes revenger
when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded
when our souls crash together, Arab and Jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes
when the refugee child and the exile’s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city
when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude
in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?
 
1984-1985"
2078,It Was All for Him,All Poets,"I strolled upon the Brooklyn Bridge one day,
             Beneath the storm;
 None but a lad in rags upon the way
 I saw;—there on a bench he lay
             Heedless of form. 
  
 He seemingly was reading what the Shower
    Was publishing upon the Bridge and down the Bay;
 Yet he was writing, writing at this hour,—
    Writing in a careless sort of way. 
  
 Upon a pad he scribbled and as fast the rain
    Retouched, effaced, corrected and revised. 
 Was he recording Nature’s solemn strain,
    Or sketching choristers therein disguised? 
  
 Whatever it be, I found myself quite by his side: 
    My nod and smile he pocketed and wrote again;
 “Read me your drizzling stuff,” I said, and he replied:
    “I’ve written a check in payment for this shower of rain.”"
2079,The Walls,Ray Gonzalez,"Julius Caesar’s head was cut off

The last thing John Lennon saw

J. D. Salinger scribbled on his bedroom
walls as a boy, promising his mother

Joan of Arc climbed over the walls

who swore the wall opened and
she escaped by stepping through.

it was a green one they told him to push,
but the triggers were every color except green.
Hernán Cortés’ men met a wall

Montezuma’s men met a wall of armor,

Carl Jung opened his eyes to find himself

Charlie Chaplin ordered his crew to remove

Sor Juana de la Cruz hid her new poem

it was gone.
The Dalai Lama stopped in the snow

Janis Joplin was found dead of an overdose
in her Los Angeles hotel, her face facing the wall.
Federico García Lorca did not face any walls

No one knows how Tu Fu encased himself
in a wall of bamboo, staying inside the tube

becoming the roots of bamboo within
the first few months of his silence.
Al Capone stared at the walls of his cell
in Alcatraz and added the bank figures again,
trying to get them right.
 
Babe Ruth heard a thud against the wall
of his hotel suite, the baseball rolling down
the hallways as a signal his tryst with the team
owner’s wife about to be revealed.
William Shakespeare stared at the empty walls
of the theatre, stood there without saying
a word, and stared at the empty walls of the theatre.
 
Geronimo extended his arms over the walls
of rock, the approaching sound of the cavalry
troops echoing down the canyon, the pictograph
Geronimo carved high on the wall, years ago,

Two days before Salvador Allende was assassinated,
Pablo Neruda, dying of cancer, woke at Isla Negra

2080,For My Wife Cutting My Hair,Bruce Guernsey,"You move around me expertly like the good, round
Italian barber I went to in Florence,
years before we met, his scissors
a razor he sharpened on a belt.

But at first when you were learning, I feared
for my neck, saw my ears like sliced fruit
on the newspapered floor. Taking us back in time,
you cleverly clipped my head in a flat-top.

The years in between were styles no one had ever seen,
or should see again: when the wind rose
half my hair floated off in feathers,
the other half bristling, brief as a brush.

In the chair, almost asleep, I hear the bright
scissors dancing. Hear you hum, full-breasted as Aida,
carefully trimming the white from my temples,
so no one, not even I, will know."

2084,Bees of Eleusis,Franz Wright,"Unless a grain of wheat goes into the ground and dies, it remains nothing but a grain of wheat.          —John 12:24

                    
                    The ingredients gathered, a few small red tufts of the dream spoor per sheaf of Demeter’s blonde wheat, reaped in mourning, in silence, ground up with the pollen and mixed into white wine and honey. These stored forms of light taken under the ground. Taken by mouth. First those who by birth hold in secret the word; then placed on the tongues of the new ones, into whose ears it is meant to be whispered. Word murdered, forgotten so long ago, placed as a kiss on the lips of the soon-to-be-no-longer breathing who mean to enter death with open eyes, with mouths saying Death, what death? We have no word for it in our country where the bride of a brighter oblivion reigns. Not the purple-haired god but the child queen, the raped girl, come back from the dead hand in hand with the child she conceived there, returned in a resurrected virginity, wind through green wheat. Present-day site of a minor refinery in Christ. Although by the tenth generation already the children of light (“in their dark garments”) had trampled and smashed and generally raped the two thousand years of this precinct and its holy meal, intolerable mirror. Men who’d designed and bowed down to a law derived from the sayings of one who appeared here to say that the law is abolished, it is too late, all that is over with. Men who bungled their way through the next eighteen centuries before finally descending into the earth themselves, and what they found there they used, and we thank you for destroying the destroyers of the world. And here at the end this is as good as any other entrance to the underplace, journey of the fallen leaf back to the branch, to the bees of Eleusis among olive blossoms, untroubled among crimson wildflowers. Four thousand years later: same flowers, same bees."
2085,Blade,Franz Wright,"If I stare into it long enough, the point comes when I don’t know what it’s called, a condition in which lacerations are liable to occur, like a slip of the tongue; when a drop of blood might billow in a glass of water, blooming in velvet detonation and imparting to it the colorless, tasteless and originless fear in which I wake.

1975–2010"
2086,Circle,Franz Wright,"Say I had no choice, this weightless finger touched my tongue and told me to, it taught me; when kinder and more subtle methods failed, it put a gun to my head, a zero seared coldly in one temple, electrode glued chill to the other, the sniffer dogs rooting and snuffling in my crotch, the small white doorless room, the laser flashlight in one eye. You can’t hear the voice when it utters let there be speech, yet I faithfully spoke what I thought I was supposed to, inspired idiot, or dummy on that lap of language, the words themselves more real than I, words here before we were and when we are not again. So I blurted it out, my initial soliloquies, what I could catch through the static, giving my head a good thump now and then like one of those black-and-white 
tv
 sets, and projecting, those were some vast stadiums, the first row of faces as far as near stars if there at all, never having the faintest idea what it meant, the microphone dead, I did my best, tell them. Inch-thick rope for ascot, eyes put out, chained to my oars, all the others long vanished: the first minute of death is so long, like the first minute of consciousness there in the infinite darkness of somebody weeping, you never arrive, never reach shore, never mind with what clarity you seem to hear with your lips distant roar of surf breaking. I pulled too for those who’d come later, I’m guessing, singing in their names as well, sort of lip-synching but singing twice as loud, strapped to the mast, earways cleared, though I heard nothing but nothing, blue. Making up what I couldn’t make out, and all that uproarious and pitiless derision I had to raise my voice above, I mere link—out on that unknown ocean beating at my ears, just as at the beginning, the mother’s heart booming softly; from nowhere it came, like me, months before I arrived to take up the sorry job of being me, whatever a month was, whatever I was then, blind little dolphin with a thumb in its mouth, whatever a mouth was; poor mother mourning her own mother’s dying, over the actual ocean she lay, a strong stone’s throw from the Ohio or that poisoned ghost of it. Mother of my mother dying away from this world just as I was about to die into it. I see them there, up to their knees, gathered as for a baptism, cross traced in hydrochloric acid on a tiny forehead, right there at the dead water’s edge a scythe of moon, a meteor in arc of falling axe of gold for the severing of hairy umbilical rope, hear me out! I saw they were standing watch over her, and my mother’s conspicuous absence, wincing at the constant cough; and I saw her whom I would never meet, nearing peace in the scarlet Magdalenean cerements, clenching lightly between thumb and skeletal forefinger the scarlet egg, and the wide river’s sundering undertow sucking to its breast her shrunken body, fetal in her narrow bed, nothing but a huckleberry craft by now just vanishing around the first bend, more and more lost from sight by my mother, twenty-two, unaided by lunatic male she’d been sentenced to, from Goethe-phase to Trakl-phase. And she breaks down in her hotel room, in bullet-pocked Vienna, helplessly swept down the blind unwept current still flowing, sadness’s chemistry, horror’s and guilt’s, to this day through my veins. Months before we met, I listening to her crying, it went on forever, how 
not
 hear it, how not be fed it, in a shoreless darkness of sorrowing I listened, still listen, now watch this and pay close attention: nothing else there, only a listening called me, no name even, till they grave it in stone. Until we finally met, I watched her face rise on the horizon. Then there was some loud mutual screaming in the even more terrible blindness called light. Long before I invented the first word it taught me, it told me the others, so many. So only what was never mine is mine; and when no one is listening I sing what it means to me, even now, hearing my voice through my own disappearing, farther away every day, my mother’s mother’s fate and mine now one as I board the ocean liner at three months of age and arrive in New York, filled with space and time."
2087,Conversation with Slugs and Sarah,Jennifer Chang,"Up late watching slug porn, you confess
you had a boyfriend who could spin you 

like that, slug grace and slug ballet—we don’t
touch the topic of slime—and those eyes 

dangling from tentacle tips must be a
kind of love or lust, sighting farther and

nearer all at once. (But are those eyes?)  
Slug sublimity suggests love’s a drag, 

touch that lingers and leaves a wet trail of 
memory and... What did we do before 

YouTube? Boob tube. Boobs we have none; slugs, 
of course, don’t care, can’t tell girl from boy, 

(being, you know, hermaphrodites), and only 
want flesh to fly. Forget their infamous 

languor—here’s litheness in loving, buoyant 
miracles of want, one slug spiraling 

on the axis of another like a globe 
slapped by an insolent hand. Neither old 

nor young, we’re familiar with sluggishness, 
too tired to explain why nothing makes us 

spin like that: a-swirl, a pirouette, a gyre! 
It’s either fucking or marriage, I say,

saying more than I mean. Why can’t lust be
love and love be lust? you’re always asking, 

even now as the slugs begin their sluggish
withdrawal—each complete in love and lust;

each mother and father to what they’ve made
together; each alone, content, and free."
2088,Easter,Jill Alexander Essbaum,"is my season
of defeat.

Though all
is green 

and death 
is done,  

I feel alone.
As if the stone

rolled off
from the head

of the tomb
is lodged

in the doorframe
of my room,

and everyone
I’ve ever loved

lives happily
just past

my able reach.
And each time 

Jesus rises
I’m reminded

of this marble
fact:

they are not
coming back."
2089,Futility in Key West,Mark Strand,"I was stretched out on the couch, about to doze off, when I imagined a small figure asleep on a couch identical to mine. “Wake up, little man, wake up,” I cried. “The one you’re waiting for is rising from the sea, wrapped in spume, and soon will come ashore. Beneath her feet the melancholy garden will turn bright green and the breezes will be light as babies’ breath. Wake up, before this creature of the deep is gone and everything goes blank as sleep.” How hard I try to wake the little man, how hard he sleeps. And the one who rose from the sea, her moment gone, how hard she has become—how hard those burning eyes, that burning hair."
2090,Galah’s Skull,Sarah Holland-Batt,"I find it in a field of feathers, pink-crested,
a knuckle of bone picked clean by the wind,
a pale mohawk mounted on stone.

I bend down. Zeroed out of its head 
are two sockets, two airy planets
full with sun, and taking asylum in one

a millipede is coiled, a slick black hypnotist.
Polished, it spirals in on itself
like one of Saint Hilda’s fossil snakes

we studied in the school chapel’s stained glass. 
As if the eye could dig itself into the earth 
then extend a curled feeler out, like a fern.

I turn the skull round in my palm like a pebble—
it will not settle. Otherwise, all is still: 
the grasses claw in, the world does not tilt.

Even the blue stand of scrub grows over;
it has nothing on its mind. But the skull 
will outlast the summer, a thought cut short,

and I will pass it every day as I walk
and stop just here, where the air hones its teeth
on bone, where the mind remembers itself

only as a shell, and I will mourn what was once 
a world: one eye rolled to the daylight moon, 
the other pressed down into the earth."
2091,Home for Christmas,Franz Wright,"Fifteen years later the old tollbooth keeper is still at his post but cannot break a twenty, regrettably, his brains blown out, or provide the forgotten directions. I did phone, what do you think? Before I can blink I am parked out front of the unbelievably small, unlighted house.I’ve got my finger on the buried bell, nothing. For hours I’ve been walking around, and I hate to be the one to tell you this, but no one is home in Zanesville, Ohio. My dusty toothbrush waits for me, of this I feel quite sure, my teenage image in the dust-dimmed mirror waits. Only now I’m afraid I’ll be forced to disturb the slow fine snow of dust that’s been coming down, year after year, on my blanket and hair, and put on my dust-covered clothes, and walk without making a sound, trailing my eternal lunar footprints, down the windless hall, and down the stairs at last. It’s not going to happen overnight. But one of these days I’ll arrive; I will go down to sit with the father. The elderly father, strictly speaking, of never really having been there.I will sit down and eat my bowl of dust like all the rest."
2092,Imago,Franz Wright,"From my cell I was staring at a cloud, a dog decaying in the woods, etc., as I took up the long-awaited sequel to my 
Confessions
. By this time my hand was so far away that it looked like a small hairless spider whose progress I could hardly help but follow, from the corner of one eye, as it went on filling page after page in a notebook the size of a stamp with words too small for anyone to read. I looked up and noticed my bars had turned to gold. And before I forget, I’d like to be the first to congratulate everyone who has not committed suicide up until now. Camouflaged and lightless congregation, the world will never know your names, never know of its debt to you, or what you suffered; with what uncomplaining anguish you sacrificed the one thing all hold most dear, most have in common, the sense of being completely different from anybody else—it just vanished at some point, having attained its sexually mature and winged stage. You had a great vision about it, but told no one. 
We have misnamed death life and life death
. You saw another world, and it was precisely the same as this one. This time you told everyone, until someone asked you very nicely to quiet down. And the weather—everything you have heard on that subject is a serious understatement. The scarlet horrors were preparing to file in for my ignominious obsequies, already they swarmed freely over my body. Then, there was no weather. I can’t tell you how perfect that was. As it happens I had been gazing up at the dusk stars, as I can be found doing more or less day and night, for I like to think they are growing younger as I die, come by some time and tell me what you think. Under torture—some atrocious form of tickling, for example—I guess I’d describe myself as a fairly good egg in hot water. Family motto roughly translates, 
April wizards bring May blizzards
. We tend to be apprehended eventually, after a futile but all the more spirited attempt at first degree self-impersonation; however, this is not the time for levity, we happen to be speaking of a serious medical goodnight kiss. Traditionally, we are then detained at a local mental facility known for its celebrated alumni, though in recent decades secret and permanent socialist elements in the government have seen to it that the lowest scum of humanity now appear to have open access to those once hallowed halls smeared with 
our
 shit and vomit. What I’m getting at is this: after a relatively brief stay, we are invariably released with some deranged doctor’s or other’s blessing, a mixture of relief and disgust on the part of the staff, and the secret eye-signal that will get you into any movie house in Milwaukee free for the next year. Some of us like to get together once a day, rain or shine, and gather furtively at the picnic grounds under those tall wavering candleflame pines, where neither moth nor rust can reach, nor faintest scream, and exchange ribald tales verging on satanic perversion, each drawing his iridescent injection from the same oceanic martini, very dry, about two tears’ worth of vermouth, in an unremembered dream."

2095,The Minister of Culture Gets His Wish,Mark Strand,"The Minister of Culture goes home after a grueling day at the office. He lies on his bed and tries to think of nothing, but nothing hap-pens or, more precisely, does not happen. Nothing is elsewhere doing what nothing does, which is to expand the dark. But the minister is patient, and slowly things slip away—the walls of his house, the park across the street, his friends in the next town. He believes that nothing has finally come to him and, in its absent way, is saying, “Darling, you know how much I have always wanted to please you, and now I have come. And what is more, I have come to stay.”"
2096,Moppet,David Harsent,"Consider the rip for a mouth, the rip in the crotch, the hank of hair,

consider the flair for ill-fortune, the empty stare, the done deal 

with sorrow, the rich and rare nest-egg of dreams, the share and share

alike in matters of loss, the payments in kind, the liking for blind

bets, for truth or dare; consider the threadbare get up, the make-up

beyond repair, the tin-tack teeth, consider the dungeon voice

wanting nothing more than bare house-room, and nothing less 

than hand-in-glove, a pigeon pair given over to make and mend, 

to touch and go, to wear and tear, and all it takes is this: forswear  

flint and fire, stay silent, be white on white, live in dead air."
2097,The Mysterious Arrival of an Unusual Letter,Mark Strand,"It had been a long day at the office and a long ride back to the small apartment where I lived. When I got there I flicked on the light and saw on the table an envelope with my name on it. Where was the clock? Where was the calendar? The handwriting was my father’s, but he had been dead for forty years. As one might, I began to think that maybe, just maybe, he was alive, living a secret life somewhere nearby. How else to explain the envelope? To steady myself, I sat down, opened it, and pulled out the letter. “Dear Son,” was the way it began. “Dear Son” and then nothing."
2098,Mystery and Solitude in Topeka,Mark Strand,"Afternoon darkens into evening. A man falls deeper and deeper into the slow spiral of sleep, into the drift of it, the length of it, through what feels like mist, and comes at last to an open door through which he passes without knowing why, then again without knowing why goes to a room where he sits and waits while the room seems to close around him and the dark is darker than any he has known, and he feels something forming within him without being sure what it is, its hold on him growing, as if a story were about to unfold, in which two characters, Pleasure and Pain, commit the same crime, the one that is his, that he will confess to again and again, until it means nothing."

2100,No Words Can Describe It,Mark Strand,"How those fires burned that are no longer, how the weather worsened, how the shadow of the seagull vanished without a trace. Was it the end of a season, the end of a life? Was it so long ago it seems it might never have been? What is it in us that lives in the past and longs for the future, or lives in the future and longs for the past? And what does it matter when light enters the room where a child sleeps and the waking mother, opening her eyes, wishes more than anything to be unwakened by what she cannot name?"

2102,This Landscape Before Me,Sarah Holland-Batt,"Is unwritten, though it has lived in violence.

First the factory stood, quiet as an asylum. 
Then the annihilating mallee with its red fists of blossoms 
and the mountain ash creeping over it like a stain.

I have no proof, but I tell you 
there were leadlight windows here once, barred.
They cast a little striped light on the women.

Now in scrub and yellow broom I stand on a history 
braided and unbraided by stiff Irish wrists. 
The rope and span and carded wool are unpicked
as are their faces and names.

Londonderry, Cork, Galway, Kildare— 
as I say the words they are sucked away
to a hemisphere in darkness.

I will not presume to say
what suffering is or how it was meted out in this place.
At what point it breaks a body I cannot tell. 

But this morning I saw a young rabbit 
hunched in brush and shadow.
I saw its lesioned face, its legs too thin to scramble,
the blood-berry red and pink scab of its eye. 

It had caught the disease 
we brought here for it
and wanted a quiet place to die.  

And it was lucky, or as lucky as it would get—
there was time and light, the hawks and dogs
had not been written yet, and were still out of sight."

2106,As from a Quiver of Arrows,Carl Phillips,"What do we do with the body, do we
burn it, do we set it in dirt or in
stone, do we wrap it in balm, honey,
oil, and then gauze and tip it onto
and trust it to a raft and to water?

What will happen to the memory of his
body, if one of us doesn't hurry now
and write it down fast? Will it be
salt or late light that it melts like?
Floss, rubber gloves, and a chewed cap

to a pen elsewhere —how are we to
regard his effects, do we throw them
or use them away, do we say they are
relics and so treat them like relics?
Does his soiled linen count? If so,

would we be wrong then, to wash it?
There are no instructions whether it
should go to where are those with no
linen, or whether by night we should
memorially wear it ourselves, by day

reflect upon it folded, shelved, empty.
Here, on the floor behind his bed is
a bent photo—why? Were the two of
them lovers? Does it mean, where we
found it, that he forgot it or lost it

or intended a safekeeping? Should we
attempt to make contact? What if this
other man too is dead? Or alive, but
doesn't want to remember, is human?
Is it okay to be human, and fall away

from oblation and memory, if we forget,
and can't sometimes help it and sometimes
it is all that we want? How long, in
dawns or new cocks, does that take?
What if it is rest and nothing else that

we want? Is it a findable thing, small?
In what hole is it hidden? Is it, maybe,
a country? Will a guide be required who
will say to us how? Do we fly? Do we
swim? What will I do now, with my hands?"
2107,At the Three Fountains,Arthur Symons,"Here, where God lives among the trees,
   Where birds and monks the whole day sing
His praises in a pleasant ease,

O heart, might we not find a home
   Here, after all our wandering?
These gates are closed, even on Rome.

Souls of the twilight wander here;
   Here, in the garden of that death
Which was for love's sake, need we fear

How sharp with bitter joy might be
   Love's lingering, last, longed-for breath,
Shut in upon eternity?"

2109,Bedtime Reading for the Unborn Child,Khaled Mattawa,"Long after the sun falls into the sea
and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet
and the air gets soaked in blackness;
long after clouds hover above like boulders
and stars crawl up and stud the sky;
long after bodies tangle, dance, and falter
and fatigue blows in and bends them
and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them
and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them,
a girl unlatches a window,
walks shoeless into a forest,
her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness.

She walks into woods, her feet light-stepping
through puddles, over hard packed dirt,
through grassy hills, over sticks and pebbles
over sand soaked in day, stones sun-sizzled
over lakes and frigid streams
through dim cobbled streets
darkened squares and dusty pastures.
She runs from nothing, runs to nothing,
beyond pain, beyond graveyards and clearings.
In the dark the eyes of startled creatures
gleam like a herd of candles.
They scatter and give night its meaning.

What echo of a bell lulled her
what spirit, what scent of a word
whose storm wrote her
what banks fell to drown her
which blood star
which thread of water
which trickle of light
whose heart being launched
whose floating soul seduced her
what promise did it make her
whose memory burned her
whose prayer did she run to answer
whose help, what sorrow clot
what pain dammed inside her
what wall must she rebuild now
whose treasure beckons her
who spread ivy like a veil to blind her?
Daybreak lies chained to a blue wall
from which the stars drop
and lose all meaning.

She runs past villages that lost their names
roads that lost their destinations
seas that lost their compasses and sailors
rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers
houses that lost their sleepers and criers
trees that lost their songs and shadows
gardens that lost their violets and benches
valleys that lost their worms and farmers
mountains that lost their prophets and marauders
temples that lost their sinners and spires
lightning that lost its silver and wires
chimeras that lost their bridges
minotaurs that lost their fountains.
Crescent moons hover above her,
ancient white feathers, birdless, wingless
lost to their own meaning.

Music rises out of her vision.
It stands, a wall covered with silver mosses.
A clarinet sounds a wounded mare,
violins women who lost their children.
Flutes blow their hot dry breezes.
Drums chuckle the earth’s ceaseless laughter.
Pianos are mumbling sorcerers
calling spirits and powers.
Cellos chew on the sounds of thunder.
Dulcimers skip about on crutches.
Dance floors flash their knives
daring their dancers.
Words mill about the streets like orphans.
Then a lute begins groaning
and dawn loses its meaning.

Night girl, night girl
your book is full now.
You have drawn all the pictures.
You have seen many weepers.
Stars held your sky in place and moons
floated on your lakes and washed them.
When a bird sings
when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes
when curtains are soaked with light
when mirrors drown in shadows,
take your day to the shore, my child.
Put out the words that fired your waking,
scatter them on the sand like seeds,
then with your feet gently tap them,
and let the bright waves
receive your meaning."

The wonder of the world against my world's delight!
Rome, that hast conquered worlds, with intellectual might
Capture my heart, and teach my memory to forget!"

  November 2001

Are we on the ground now? Ally cells and I said operations.
We cleared 50% of a wonderful friend and enduring opposition.
Take the solid.
Louder.
We clearly are loud. We are the postal system.
No evidence has been information.
Attacking the caves. Are you on the ground enduring?
A wonderful friend ramped it up.
You ought to open your mail.
Opposition element: the air. The talents work with precision.
84%. The population attacking the caves, the talents work with the
caves and tunnels.
Hiding in caves, wavering in caves and hiding in mosques.
A wonderful friend on the ground.
Freedom I said: the enduring ally cells.
Interested in the view, in our aid sensitivities.
50% to the front of our effort adding that 80% are willing to play.
Independent oper-oppo-sition forces that are rosy.
So make assumptions on the ground. Are we on the ground now?
Can be more than air. The target. The air liaison.
Campaign with the bombing and entirely happy.
Attacking the leaflets.
We keep working hiding in hiding in caves
and cowering in cowering in cowering in caves
and I could say confidential areas.
The mosques and rest efforts are mad.
Execution in the targeting of democracy.
Those risks culti-targeting to minimize the individual.
An obligation to the spirit of enterprise.
A war of roundup freezing worldwide, and proceeding on course.
Training facilities, proceeding on course, freezing their guided
munitions.
A population is tons of struggle against evil.

2113,East of Carthage: An Idyll,Khaled Mattawa,"1.

Look here, Marcus Aurelius, we’ve come to see
your temple, deluded the guards, crawled through a hole
in the fence. Why your descendent, my guide and friend

has opted for secrecy, I don’t know. But I do know
what to call the Africans, passport-less, yellow-eyed
who will ride the boat before me for Naples, they hope.

Here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter
storm like a cough, or the seadog drops them at Hannibal’s
shores, where they’ll stand stupefied like his elephants.

What dimension of time will they cross at the Hours loop
tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists?
What siren song will the trucks shipping them back

to Ouagadougou drone into their ears? I look at them
loitering, waiting for the second act of their darkness
to fall. I look at the sky shake her dicey fists.

One can be thankful, I suppose, for not being one of them,
and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself
to keep the cold wind at bay. But what world is this

that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon’s rope
is about to snap, while the sea and sky ache to become
an open-ended road? That’s what we’re all waiting for,

a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit, and let us in
on its sweetness as we wait, smoking, or fondling provisions,
listening the engine’s invocational purr. In an hour

that will dawn and dusk at once, one that will stretch
into days strung like beads on the horizon’s throat,
they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star

begins to float on the water, so bright and still,
you’d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand.

2.

A pair of Roman fists robbed of spear and shield;
the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn

that slipped from the buttery hands, aluminum
wrappers smudged with processed cheese;

countless cigarette butts surround the fallen
columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam;

pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion…

The ruins are not ruined.
                                   Without all this garbage
packed, stratified, how else to name our age?

3.

Earlier, I had walked the market of Sabratha, changed
to its people, but like my old city brought me back to me.
The petty merchants, all selling the same goods, shouted out
jokes to each other. A Sudanese waiter carried a tray
with a giant pot of green tea with mint. Among the older men,

their heads capped with crimson shennas, I kept seeking
my father’s face. An old lust wafted past me when the abaya-clad
women, scented with knock-off Chanel, sashayed by.
The sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries,
the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves

with spoons of searing harissa, my mouth watering
to a childhood burn. Pyramids of local oranges,
late season pomegranates, radish and turnip bulbs
stacked like billiard balls, and the half carcasses of lambs
as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks,

the trays of hearts, kidneys, brains and testicles arrayed
in slick arabesques. The hand-woven rugs where
the extinct mouflon thrives, mincers, hairdryers, and toasters,
their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves.

It was as if my eyes were painting, not seeing, what I saw,
my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole.
What face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration?
I know what the eyes of the men my age said, settled now
in comfortable middle age, about the life I left behind.

True, I did envy them the asceticism of their grace,
where a given horizon becomes a birthright—to drive or walk
past the same hills all your life, to eat from the same tree
and drink from the well that gave you your name.

4.

Though for centuries the locals broke the statues’
limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery,
enough remains to echo all that has disappeared:

you and the woman leave the towpath, and you brace her
against the trunk of an oak. It’s not the moonlight, but refractions
from suburban homes trapped under cloud-cover
that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees.

First, God made love:   
                         the canopy like the inside of an emerald,
her lips a rush of cochineal. Then a route of evanescence
brought her from Carthage into these living arms, here.

5.

“A nice time, “ he tells us, how he and four
cousins crossed the desert heading home
on top of three-years’ worth of meager pay
(the tarp ballooning, a giant dough) roped to a truck.

Wearing the goggles of the welder he'd hoped
to become, he looked at the sky and wondered “what
those flying, smoke on their tails, thought of us.”

Later, deported in a cargo plane, he handed
the Tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports,
and they like “space aliens” (in shabby uniforms,
sunglasses, tribal veils) poured into his face.

As the propellers’ hammering calmed to
a shuddering hum, he saw the stars, “hundreds
of them like gnats” swarm Mt. Akakous’ peak.

“My next road is the water,” he says serving
us tonight, and we promise, if the coffee is good,
to put him on the next boat to the moon
                                                shining over Syracuse.

6.

Suddenly, I find your descendant’s hands leafing through
my chapters, scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts:

            “How is it,” he asks, “that starlight announces the hour:
             how can a song divide desire in two?”

“My flame,” I must have written or said, “coated her body
like silk, one kiss spreading threads of lightening

into her pores, until she became a sob, barely lifted by the wind,
and I became mist, the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn.”

             To that he responds, “a Platonic echo;” and
             “What will come of such a plasticine love?”

Marcus Aurelius, your descendent knows I’ll leave
as I arrive, so empty he gets lost in me.

7.

Two centuries ago, one of my ancestors sat
on one of the communal latrines in mid-morning
and listened to Apuleius’s defense. Across from him
on that marble hexagon, sat two other men.
On normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest,

the feast of Venus coming soon. But today they listen to
the Madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes,
cracking their own one-liners, shaking their heads in delight.
Away from the hot midday sun and the throngs,

you could say, they had the best seats in the house,
and so they lingered and heard as much as they could
then went about their business. So what if a man maries
an older woman for her money, what impoverished young Roman
in his right mind wouldn’t do that? And sure too, if some man

comes to take your inheritance, even if he’s your best friend,
even if he takes good care of your mother, you’d be a fool
not to sue him to the Council, even if you’d have to accuse him
falsely of black magic. That’s the beauty of it, or rather,

whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty,
that things being already right, can be more right, which
is what “beautiful” really means. And what better way,
to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine
where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life.

8.

Marcus Aurelius, the men at the shore follow your path
into eternity, though they already see their journey
as a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feeding

on the universe’s hide, tumors in detention camps,
in basement kitchens. Their pockets filled with drachmas,
they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame.

One of them is now driving a taxi in Thessaloniki or Perugia.
With enough of the language to understand direction, he engages
his late night passengers. In the light of the dashboard

they’ll entrust him with their secrets. With time, he’ll become
a light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly,
and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark

soil of philosophy. It’s the gift of seasons that stray
from the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh,
forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself.

9.

The birds that drew the line to the first distance
remain nameless to me—

creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes,
black/brown (dark roast) wings.

The deserts they crossed, the plains east
or north of here fall like sand from my hands.

 Um Bsisi, I want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny,
native and stranger, prodigal and peasant—

admit now, they you’re none of these,
that you’re not any,
                        or even all of them combined.

10.

Southwest of here is Apuleius’s hometown, his inescapable
destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies.
“Lacking the poverty of the rich,” he’s splurged,
a month-long trip to the Olympic games; and openhanded,
he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries.

Few return to Madaura once gone, and when heading back
shamefaced like him, they’d do as he did, taking
the longest route hoping the journey would never end. Here
in Sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him,
and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began.

I look out toward Madaura, my back to the theater
and the latrines, Madaura birthplace of Augustine, site of
his first schooling—little Augustine holding a satchel of scrolls
and a  loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother,

his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warm
with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forced
to slurp it, sweetened with honey from the Atlas, a sprinkling
of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm.

If the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering,
why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turning
out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love?

He lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own.
He refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces
his mother’s embrace. It only lasted a month,

this partial answer, because even then everyone knew
that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds,
that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens

and deepens like the sea before them, a place
meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth.
That’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly,
because God was like rain and they like the saplings

which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn.
And that’s why Africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished,
visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if
it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come.

The merchant who’d built it, money made from smuggling
subsidized goods to Carthage and used Renaults from Rotterdam,
ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand
next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun.
There’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought.

It’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers,
some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim.
Why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve lived
without words for so long—why not release them
from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?

11.

In a few weeks you’ll see pedants here with binoculars
trying to catch a glimpse of the Ramadan crescent,
and if these migrants stick around here
time will belong to the departure of other travelers,

flocks of Um Bsisi follwing the sun’s arch,
Japanese and Korean trawlers sailing to Gibraltar
or Suez chasing the last herring or sardine.

Where is she now in her time?—
her life dissolved in other people’s minutes,
a sense of solitude her diligent companion
even when she lets go of herself to kindness.

He’ll be there when she returns from the party,
he’ll lie beside her when she sleeps. He’ll say,
“Time belongs to the species, but your life belongs to me.”

She’ll laugh at his words, and remember what you,
Marcus Aurelius, had said about losing only the moment
at hand, how it circles in a ring of dead nerves,
how we stand impoverished before what is to come.

She’ll have her answer to your elocution;
she’d always had an answer for you,
one she refuses to share even with herself.

12.

At last they set to sail. They slaughter a rooster,
douse blood on the Dido figurehead adorning the prow.
The seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah.
His Egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater,

twists the brass head into it, caking the slit with sand.
He fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco,
wraps it with foil, pokes it tenderly with a knife.
He picks embers from the going fire, places a few

on the aluminum crown, and inhales and blows
until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog,
the color of semen, I think, then hands the pipe hose
to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over

to the travelers in turn. The air smells sweet around us,
the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine.
Their communion done, they embark except the one who
stands, the dead rooster in his hand, as if wanting

to entrust it to us, then digs a hurried hole to bury it in.
The boat, barely visible, leaves a leaden lacey ribbon
aiming directly for the burnt orange sun. As it reddens,
for a moment, their standing silhouettes eclipse it.

Then the sea restores its dominion, dark as the coffee cooling
in our cups. Dangling from the vine arbor, the lights reflect
a constellation on the table’s dark top. I trace my fingers among them,
hoping conjecture would shine on the mind’s calculus.

Between my unquiet eddies, Marcus Aurelius,
and the coursing water, the travelers’ moment sails,
its tentacles sewing a rupture I had nursed for too long."
2114,Echo & Elixir 2,Khaled Mattawa,"Cairo’s taxi drivers speak to me in English.
I answer, and they say your Arabic is good.
How long have you been with us? All my life
I tell them, but I’m never believed.
They speak to me in Farsi, speak to me in Greek,
and I answer with mountains of gold and silver,
ghost ships sailing the weed-choked seas.
And when they speak to me in Spanish,
I say Moriscos and Alhambra.
I say Jews rescued by Ottoman boats.
And when the speak to me in Portuguese,
all my life I tell them, coffee, cocoa,
Indians and poisoned spears.
I say Afonsso king of Bikongo writing
Manuel to free his enslaved sons.
And Cairo’s taxi drivers tell me
your Arabic is surprisingly good.
Then they speak to me in Italian,
and I tell them how I lay swaddled
a month’s walk from here. I tell them
camps in the desert, barbed wire, wives
and daughters dying, camels frothing disease,
the sand stretching an endless pool.
And they say so good so good.
How long have you been with us?
All my life, but I’m never believed.
Then they speak to me in French,
and I answer Jamila, Leopold, Stanley,
baskets of severed hands and feet.
I say the horror, battles of Algiers.
And they speak to me in English
and I say Lucknow, Arbenz. I say indigo,
Hiroshima, continents soaked in tea.
I play the drum beat of stamps. I invoke
Mrs. Cummings, U.S. consul in Athens,
I say Ishi, Custer, Wounded Knee.
And Cairo's taxi drivers tell me
your Arabic is unbelievably good.
Tell the truth now, tell the truth,
how long have you been with us?
I say my first name is little lion,
my last name is broken branch.
I sing ""Happiness uncontainable""
and ""field greening in March""
until I'm sad and tired of truth,
and as usual I'm never believed.
Then they lead me through congestion,
gritty air, narrow streets crowded with
Pepsi and Daewoo and the sunken faces
of the poor. And when we arrive, Cairo's
taxi drivers and I speak all the languages
of the world, and we argue and argue about
corruption, disillusionment, the missed chances,
the wicked binds, the cataclysmic fares."
2115,The First Sam Hazo at the Last,Samuel Hazo,"A minor brush with medicine
         in eighty years was all
         he’d known.
                             But this was different.
His right arm limp and slung,
         his right leg dead to feeling
         and response, he let me spoon him
         chicken-broth.
                                 Later he said
         without self-pity that he’d like
         to die.
                   I bluffed, “The doctors
         think that therapy might help you
         walk again.”
                             “They’re liars,

         was never how he hoped to go.
“In bed you think of everything,”
         he whispered with a shrug, “you think
         of all your life.”
                                   I knew
         he meant my mother.
                                           Without her
         he was never what he might have been,
         and everyone who knew him knew it.
Nothing could take her place—
         not the cars he loved to drive,
         not the money he could earn at will,
         not the roads he knew by heart
         from Florida to Saranac, not the two
         replacement wives who never
         measured up.
                             Fed now by family
         or strangers, carried to the john,
         shaved and changed by hired help,
         this independent man turned silent
         at the end.
                          Only my wife
         could reach him for his private needs.
What no one else could do
         for him, he let her do.
She talked to him and held
         his hand, the left.
                                     She helped him
         bless himself and prayed beside him
         as my mother might have done.
“Darling” was his final word
         for her.

2116,from The Ambition of Ghosts:  I. Remembering into Sleep,Rosmarie Waldrop,"I. Separation Precedes Meeting

The cat so close
to the fire
I smell scorched
breath. Parents,
silent, behind me,
a feeling of
trees that might fall.
Or dogs.
                 A poem,
like trying
to remember,
is a movement
of the whole body.
You follow the
fog
into more fog.
Maybe the door ahead
divides
the facts
from natural affection. How
can I know. I meet
too many
in every mirror.

 
 
 
 2.
 
When I was little,
was I I?
My sister? A wolf
chained,
smothered in green virtues?
                                              Slower
time
of memory. Once
I’ve got something
I lie
down on it
with my whole body.
Goethe quotations, warm
sand, a smell of hay,
long afternoons.
                            But it
would take a road
would turn, with space,
in on itself,
would turn
occasion into offer.

 
 
 
 

 
 3.
 
For days I hold
a tiny landscape between
thumb
and index:
sand,
heather,
shimmer of blue between pines.
No smell: matchbook.
Sand as schematic as
                                    Falling
into memory,
down,
with my blood,
to the accretions
in the arteries,
to be read with the whole
body, in the chambers
of the heart.
The light: of the match,
struck,
at last.
 
 
 
 
 
    
 4.
 
Concentration: a frown
of the whole body. I can’t
remember. Too many
pasts
recede
in all directions.
Slow movement into
                                   Distant boots.
Black beetles at night. A smell
of sweat.
                 The restaurant,
yes. You’ve no idea
how much my father used to eat.
Place thick with smoke.
Cards. Beer foaming over
on the table.
                     And always
some guy said I ought
to get married,
put a pillow behind my eyes
and, with a knowing
sigh, spat
in my lap.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.
 
The present.
As difficult as
the past, once a place
curves into
           Hips swinging elsewhere.
Castles in sand.
Or Spain. Space
of another language.
                                   Sleep
is a body of water.
You follow your lips
into its softness. Far down
the head finds its level
    
 
 
 

 
 
 6. Tropisms
 
Inward, always. Night
curls the clover leaf
around its sleep.
Tightly.
The bodies of the just
roll,
all night,
through subterranean caves
which turn
in on themselves.
                                Long
tunnel
of forgetting. Need
of blur. The air,
large, curves
its whole body.
Big hammering waves
flatten my
muscles.
Inward, the distances: male
and female fields,
rigorously equal.

The drunk fell toward me
in the street. I hope
he wasn’t
disappointed. Skinned
his sleep.
                 November.
 
And a smell of snow. Quite normal,
says the landlord, the master
of rubbish, smaller
and smaller in my
curved mirror.
                         I have un-
controllable
good luck: my sleep
always turns dense
and visible. There
are many witches
in Germany. Their songs
descend in steady half-tones
through you.

You’ll die, Novalis says, you’ll die
following endless rows

even breath.

kind of air,
keeps the dream
spinning
around itself, its
missing core.

after image of pleasure
of the whole body

my sleep:
 
fins.
 
 
 

 
 
 
    
 9. Introducing Decimals
 
A dream, like trying
to remember, breaks open words
for other,
hidden meanings. The grass
pales by degrees, twigs
quaver glassily,
ice
flowers the window.
Intimate equations more complicated
than the coordinates of past
and Germany. The cat
can’t lift its paw,
its leg longer and longer
with effort.
A crying fit
is cancelled. An aria jelled
in the larynx.
Nothing moves in the cotton
coma: only Descartes
pinches himself
an every fraction
must be solved."
2117,The Ghost of a Hunter,Keith Waldrop,"He reads: What soul suffers in secret, the flesh shows openly.
 
 
    Deep within, in a region hardly accessible, a bold self-image
sends messages of bloodshed and conquest, which reverberate in
his heart of hearts.

    He does not doubt that he exists.
 
 
    The five senses have left their mark on him. It is a record of
what has happened to him, but he cannot talk or travel until he
finds a body of water.
 
 
    A man who has lived on reindeer’s flesh amuses himself with
ripples.
 
 
    In this cage was once a nightingale. In the echo, new words
for wind.
 
 
    The usual convulsions, and a green cat. And, after all, months
or years are nothing to him.
 
 
    [My image contains his body.]
 
 
    His body contains bodies.
 
 
    Blemishes.
 
 
    Inglories.
 
    Vague figures, in a howling wind, and with no notion of
perspective.
 
 
    Of countless ruined worlds, he would appropriate the
essential emblem. Wall struggling with wall, shadow with shad-
ow.

for new equipment.
 
 
    As through a fixed window, he finds a kind of space, the
visible world foreshortened.
 
 
    He does not see deeply, but—still—one thing behind another.
 
 
    He keeps a tiny bird, folded like a sheet of paper.
 
 
    Twice two is four—still—and a circle has no angles.
 
 
    Body sheds shoulder, jaw. However body may appear, the soul
 comes back in scars.
 
 
    [There are no dead. Only names.]
 
 
    Too close, ruin wrinkles the surface—his breath bothers
reality. The sun pours down. The pots are mended.
 
 
    An unfolding, from where it is all contained.
 
 
    The ships have been salvaged. [I do not know what body he
has in mind.] Clothing is resumed. Temples are rebuilt.
 
    “Which body?” we inquire, while all the liars cry out,
“Verily!”
 
 
    As though all this were in the dark.
 
 
    Here is a column of soldiers, a heap of apples, an avenue of
trees. Here a swarm of bees, of birds, a row of equidistant lines.
A set of unequal objects distributes the field of vision.
 
 
    Here is the painted world in an actual image. [I have no
theory for the clouds he sees.]"
2118,My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears,Mohja Kahf,"My grandmother puts her feet in the sink
        of the bathroom at Sears
to wash them in the ritual washing for prayer,
 wudu,
because she has to pray in the store or miss
the mandatory prayer time for Muslims
She does it with great poise, balancing
herself with one plump matronly arm
against the automated hot-air hand dryer,
after having removed her support knee-highs
and laid them aside, folded in thirds,
and given me her purse and her packages to hold
so she can accomplish this august ritual
and get back to the ritual of shopping for housewares

Respectable Sears matrons shake their heads and frown
as they notice what my grandmother is doing,
an affront to American porcelain,
a contamination of American Standards
by something foreign and unhygienic
requiring civic action and possible use of disinfectant spray
They fluster about and flutter their hands and I can see
a clash of civilizations brewing in the Sears bathroom

My grandmother, though she speaks no English,
catches their meaning and her look in the mirror says,
 I have washed my feet over Iznik tile in Istanbul
with water from the world's ancient irrigation systems
I have washed my feet in the bathhouses of Damascus
over painted bowls imported from China
among the best families of Aleppo
And if you Americans knew anything
about civilization and cleanliness,
you'd make wider washbins, anyway
My grandmother knows one culture—the right one,

as do these matrons of the Middle West. For them,
my grandmother might as well have been squatting
in the mud over a rusty tin in vaguely tropical squalor,
Mexican or Middle Eastern, it doesn't matter which,
when she lifts her well-groomed foot and puts it over the edge.
""You can't do that,"" one of the women protests,
turning to me, ""Tell her she can't do that.""
""We wash our feet five times a day,""
my grandmother declares hotly in Arabic.
""My feet are cleaner than their sink.
Worried about their sink, are they? I
should worry about my feet!""
My grandmother nudges me, ""Go on, tell them.""

Standing between the door and the mirror, I can see
at multiple angles, my grandmother and the other shoppers,
all of them decent and goodhearted women, diligent
in cleanliness, grooming, and decorum
Even now my grandmother, not to be rushed,
is delicately drying her pumps with tissues from her purse
For my grandmother always wears well-turned pumps
that match her purse, I think in case someone
from one of the best families of Aleppo
should run into her—here, in front of the Kenmore display

I smile at the midwestern women
as if my grandmother has just said something lovely about them
and shrug at my grandmother as if they
had just apologized through me
No one is fooled, but I

hold the door open for everyone
and we all emerge on the sales floor
and lose ourselves in the great common ground
of housewares on markdown."

Ya se dijeron las cosas mas oscuras

The most obscure things have already been said"
2120,Poet,Keith Waldrop,"The wind dying, I find a city deserted, except for crowds of
people moving and standing.
 
 
    Those standing resemble stories, like stones, coal from the
death of plants, bricks in the shape of teeth.
 
 
    I begin now to write down all the places I have not been—
starting with the most distant.
 
 
    I build houses that I will not inhabit."
2121,Rain,Kazim Ali,"With thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain.
Pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.

Over the echo of the water, I hear a voice saying my name.
No one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.

The pages of my notebook soak, then curl. I’ve written:
“Yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.”

The sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face.
The window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.

I am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled.
If I open my mouth now, I could drown in the rain.

I hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me.
The night collapses into your skin. I am the rain."
2122,Rain Song,Khaled Mattawa,"After Al-Sayyah

             The radio blares “Dialogue of Souls,”
and the woman who hated clouds
                          watches the sky.
             Where is the sea now? she asks.
Where is it from here?
                          What is its name?—
             this rain on a morning ride to school,
winter, my seventh year,
                          my father driving
             through rain, his eyes fixed on a world
of credit and debt. On the
                          radio, devotion to
             the lifter of harm from those who despair,
             knower of secrets with the knowledge of certainty.
Not even the anguish of those
                          years, the heavy
             traffic, cold and wind could have
touched me. I was certain the palm
                          holding me would be
             struck again. Chance allows
for that and for stars to throb
                          in reachable depths.
             Filled with grief bordering happiness,
I didn’t care if I was safe,
                          whether the storm
             was over, only that it came, the slash
of lightning, the groaning sky,
                          and the storms we made,
             how rain stripped everything of urgency,
how to the lifter of harm rise
             those who despair."
2123,Renunciation,Kazim Ali,"“The Sailor cannot see the North—but knows the Needle can—”

The books were all torn apart, sliced along the spines
Light filled all the openings that she in her silence renounced

Still: her handwriting on the papers remembered us to her
The careful matching of the papers’ edges was a road back

One night Muhummad was borne aloft by a winged horse
Taken from the Near Mosque to the Far Mosque

Each book likens itself to lichen,
stitching softly to tree trunks, to rocks

what was given into the Prophet’s ears that night:
A changing of directions—now all the scattered tribes must pray:

 Wonder well foundry, well sunborn, sundered and sound here
Well you be found here, foundered and found"
2124,Representation,Rosmarie Waldrop,"I have no conscience because I
always chew my pencil. Can we say
white paper
with black lines on it
is like a human body? This question
not to be decided by pointing
at a tree nor yet by a description
of simple pleasures.
 
 
Smell of retrieval. Led to expect the wrong
answer. An arsenal without purpose
but why yes please.
There is no touching the black box.
The tree not pointed at lives
in your bringing up the subject
and leaves space for need, falling.
 
 
The white ground. The waning heat.
I’d like
to say the history of the world.
Or that grammar
milks essence into propositions
of human kindness.
 
 
The difficulty here’s not true or false
but that the picture’s in the foreground
and its sense back where the gestures link
so closely to the bone
the words
give notice.
The application is not easy."

2127,Speech,Kazim Ali,"How struck I was by that face, years ago, in the church mural:
Eve, being led by Christ through the broken gates of Hell.

She’s been nominated for the position of Featured Saint
on the Icon of Belief, up against the dark horse candidate—

me: fever-ridden and delirious, a child in Vellore, unfolding
the packet around my neck that I was ordered not to open.

Inside, a folk cure, painted delicately in saffron.
Letters that I could not read.

Why I feel qualified for the position
based on letters I could not read amounts to this:

Neither you nor I can pronounce the difference
between the broken gates and the forbidden letters.

So what reason do we need to believe in icons or saints?
How might we otherwise remember—

without an image to fasten in that lonely place—
the rock on which a Prophet flung himself into fever?

Without an icon or church, spell “gates of Hell.”
Spell “those years ago unfolding.”

Recite to me please all the letters you are not able to read.
Spell “fling yourself skyward.”

Spell “fever.”"
2128,The Sun Came,Etheridge Knight,"And if sun comes

The sun came, Miss Brooks,—
After all the night years.
He came spitting fire from his lips.
And we flipped—We goofed the whole thing.
It looks like our ears were not equipped
For the fierce hammering.

And now the Sun has gone, has bled red,
Weeping behind the hills.
Again the night shadows form.
But beneath the placid face a storm rages.
The rays of Red have pierced the deep, have struck
The core. We cannot sleep.
The shadows sing: Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.
The darkness ain't like before.

The Sun came, Miss Brooks.
And we goofed the whole thing.
I think.
(Though ain't no vision visited my cell.)"
2129,Thinking American,Hayan Charara,"—For Dioniso D. Martínez

Take Detroit, where boys
are manufactured into men, where
you learn to think in American.
You speak to no one unless someone
speaks to you. Everyone is suspect:
baldheaded carriers from the post office;
old Polish ladies who swear
to Jesus, Joseph, and Mary;
your brother, especially your brother,
waiting in a long line for work.
There’s always a flip side.
No matter what happens,
tomorrow is a day away,
or a gin bottle if you can’t sleep,
and if you stopped drinking,
a pack of cigarettes. After that,
you’re on your own, you pack up
and leave. You still call
the city beside the strait home.
Make no mistake, it’s miserable.
After all, you bought a one-way
Greyhound ticket, cursed each
and every pothole on the road out.
But that’s where you stood
before a  mirror in the dark,
where you were too tired
to complain. You never go back.
Things could be worse. Maybe.
Detroit is a shithole, it’s where
you were pulled from the womb
into the streets. Listen,
when I say Detroit, I mean any place.
By thinking American, I mean made."
2130,To a Grey Dress,Arthur Symons,"There's a flutter of grey through the trees:
   Ah, the exquisite curves of her dress as she passes
   Fleet with her feet on the path where the grass is!

I see not her face, I but see
   The swift re-appearance, the flitting persistence—
   There!—of that flutter of grey in the distance.

It has flickered and fluttered away:
   What a teasing regret she has left in my day-dream,
   And what dreams of delight are the dreams that one may 
         dream!

It was only a flutter of grey;
   But the vaguest of raiment's impossible chances
   Has set my heart beating the way of old dances."
2131,Great Blue Heron,T. Alan Broughton,"I drive past him each day in the swamp where he stands
on one leg, hunched as if dreaming of his own form
the surface reflects. Often I nearly forget to turn left,
buy fish and wine, be home in time to cook and chill.
Today the bird stays with me, as if I am moving through
the heron’s dream to share his sky or water—places
he will rise into on slow flapping wings or where
his long bill darts to catch unwary frogs. I’ve seen
his slate blue feathers lift him as dangling legs
fold back, I’ve seen him fly through the dying sun
and out again, entering night, entering my own sleep.
I only know this bird by a name we’ve wrapped him in,
and when I stand on my porch, fish in the broiler,
wine glass sweating against my palm, glint of sailboats
tacking home on dusky water, I try to imagine him
slowly descending to his nest, wise as he was
or ever will be, filling each moment with that moment’s
act or silence, and the evening folds itself around me."
2132,Like Holderlin,Rosmarie Waldrop,"got up early
left the house immediately

bits of leather in his pockets

wilted flowers in his pockets
at the fence I pull my handkerchief
he liked to say no
“I’m no longer the same man”
and
 
“nothing is happening to me”"
2133,Hunter's Moon,Molly Fisk,"Early December, dusk, and the sky
slips down the rungs of its blue ladder
into indigo. A late-quarter moon hangs
in the air above the ridge like a broken plate
and shines on us all, on the new deputy
almost asleep in his four-by-four,
lulled by the crackling song of the dispatcher,
on the bartender, slowly wiping a glass
and racking it, one eye checking the game.
It shines down on the fox’s red and grey life,
as he stills, a shadow beside someone’s gate,
listening to winter. Its pale gaze caresses
the lovers, curled together under a quilt,
dreaming alone, and shines on the scattered
ashes of terrible fires, on the owl’s black flight,
on the whelks, on the murmuring kelp,
on the whale that washed up six weeks ago
at the base of the dunes, and it shines
on the backhoe that buried her."
